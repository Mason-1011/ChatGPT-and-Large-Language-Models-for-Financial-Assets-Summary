Chairman

Aviation – 
a force for good

Javier Ferrán, Chairman, reviews 2023, 
another year of recovery for the global 
aviation sector as people around the world 
continued to value and prioritise travel. 

In 2023, we delivered on 
our purpose of connecting 
people, businesses and 
countries, adding more 
connectivity by restoring 
capacity, reopening 
routes and flying to new 
destinations. 

This resulted in a very good financial 
performance with strong operating 
profits, which in turn helped us 
strengthen our balance sheet and 
reinvest in the business. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank 
all our employees who helped 
deliver a successful year for IAG.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Bringing economic growth
Reactivating our network has meant 
more opportunities for people and 
businesses to connect. This is important 
for IAG’s performance but also has 
a positive impact on the economies 
in which we operate. Aviation boosts 
economies, supports jobs and develops 
supply chains globally. This year, we 
commissioned a study with consultants 
PwC which analysed IAG’s economic 
impact across the EU and UK for the first 
time. It took 2019 as the reference period, 
the last full year of flying before the 
pandemic. PwC found that IAG supports 
more than 600,000 jobs in the region 
directly and indirectly and through the 
spending of travellers, contributing nearly 
€70 billion of GDP to the EU and UK.

Reaffirming our strategy
In November, we welcomed investors, 
shareholders and advisers to our first 
Capital Markets Day since 2019. This was 
an opportunity to reiterate the strength 
of the Group model and to update on 
our strategic priorities: strengthening 
IAG’s leading positions in some of the 
world’s most valuable aviation markets 
and our portfolio of world-class brands; 
enabling IAG Loyalty to reach its full 
potential; further developing our 
best-in-class strategic partnerships 
portfolio and ensuring a financially 
stable and sustainable business. 

This will be underpinned by Group-wide 
transformation of our businesses 

to drive efficiencies and higher 
customer satisfaction. Delivering 
on these priorities will enable IAG 
to maximise total shareholder returns.

a target of 40% of senior leadership 
roles to be held by women by 2025; 
we can report that by the end of 2023, 
the figure was 36%.

I was pleased that so many of our 
shareholders, investors, lenders and 
sell-side analysts took the opportunity to 
attend and I thank them for their 
ongoing support. 

Growing sustainably 
As we maintain and grow IAG’s positive 
impact on the global economy, we must 
also ensure we are growing as 
sustainably as possible. IAG led the way 
for aviation when it was the first global 
airline group to commit to net zero by 
2050 and the first European airline group 
to set the target of 10% Sustainable 
Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030. We have a 
roadmap of initiatives to enable us to 
reach the net zero target including SAF, 
new fleet and other technologies. We 
have made significant progress against 
these ambitions this year. 

As of 31 December 2023, our total 
investment in SAF is $1.0 billion of which 
86% is future commitments1.

In February 2024, we finalised a deal with 
eSAF company Twelve. This means we 
have secured one third of the SAF required 
to meet IAG’s 10% SAF by 2030 target.

Equally as important to our future is 
ensuring we maintain a diverse and 
experienced leadership team as well 
as a pipeline of talent at IAG. We set 

Our outlook 
Looking at the external environment, 
there are uncertainties in the outlook for 
the year ahead. Although our industry 
has so far appeared resilient to the 
challenging economic environment, 
2024 could bring additional headwinds. 
Geopolitical instability and the closure of 
foreign airspace is impacting on flight 
routes and destinations. In addition, we 
have faced some operational challenges, 
particularly at London Heathrow and 
Dublin airports. There is a risk of further 
disruption caused by air traffic control 
strikes in France and incidents such as 
the NATS outage in August in the UK. 

Despite the uncertainty, we are 
confident that we will deliver both 
IAG’s medium- and long-term financial 
ambitions. We have the ambition and 
the capability to do it, thanks to our 
people who are the ones driving our 
performance and transformation. 
Their support gives us confidence 
that we will deliver on our commitment 
to sustainable growth and returns 
for shareholders, while continuing 
to contribute to countries, 
communities and economies.

Luis Gallego
IAG CEO

Transforming 
for the future 

Luis Gallego, IAG CEO, discusses 2023, 
a year when IAG delivered a strong financial 
performance, and shared its strategic priorities 
and transformation plans for the future.

What we do in IAG has a positive 
impact in the world, fulfilling our 
purpose of connecting people, 
businesses and countries. In 2023, 
our airlines flew more than 115 million 
passengers to more than 250 
destinations and transported valuable 
cargo across our network. IAG delivered 
strong profits and returns on invested 
capital last year, with all businesses 
within the Group performing well. 

These achievements have only been 
possible because of the dedication 
of our people in all IAG businesses, 
and I would like to thank them all for 
the commitment they have shown. 

Strong financial performance
In 2023, IAG delivered an operating 
profit before exceptional items of 
€3,507 million, an improvement of 
€2,260 million versus 2022. This allowed 
us to significantly strengthen our 
balance sheet, reducing gross debt by 
€3.9 billion by the end of the year. The 
Group also regained its S&P 
investment-grade credit rating, which is 
another important milestone in its 
financial recovery.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

markets from Europe, 31% on routes to 
North America and 19% on routes to 
Latin America and the Caribbean. A little 
over a third of this traffic is concentrated 
in the European short-haul market, with 
the remaining 15% in the largest point-
to-point markets in the rest of the world. 
The size and position of our hubs – 
Barcelona, Dublin, London and Madrid 
– on the western side of Europe give us 
a major competitive advantage. 

Regarding the Air Europa transaction, we 
are working on a very ambitious remedy 
package that we believe will be able to 
fully address the European Commission’s 
concerns. We remain committed to 
closing this transaction as quickly as 
possible in 2024 to start delivering the 
deal’s benefits for consumers and the 
wider Spanish economy, while increasing 
Madrid’s competitiveness with other 
European hubs.

Our brand portfolio is well-positioned 
across a range of customer segments 
from cost-conscious to premium 
travellers, leisure and business 
passengers, and both short and long-
haul routes. All airlines have invested 
in customer experience in 2023, 
including in cabin interiors, lounge 
upgrades, digital capability and service. 
IAG airlines will invest approximately 
€2.5 billion in customer initiatives, 
including IT, from 2024 to 2026, a 
two-fold increase compared with the 
pre-COVID-19 pandemic average.

Driving earnings growth through 
asset-light businesses
In addition to strengthening our airlines’ 
leadership positions, we will drive earnings 
through our capital-light businesses, in 
particular IAG Loyalty. We will focus on 
developing IAG Loyalty so it can reach its 
full potential within the Group. Our loyalty 
programme offers high operating margins, 
capital-light growth and sustainable cash 
flows with a less seasonal earnings profile 
than airlines. IAG Loyalty has become an 
increasingly attractive part of the IAG 
portfolio, generating external revenue of 
over £1 billion and profit growth of 10% 
per annum. With over 8.2 million active 
members, IAG Loyalty provides the 
opportunity to gain greater insights into 
customer needs and behaviours, in order 
to drive greater loyalty for our airline 
brands. It attracted a record number of 
new customers in 2023 and created new 
opportunities for customers to collect and 
redeem Avios. A new partnership with 
Qatar Airways also saw its Privilege Club 
adopt Avios as its reward currency, and 
Finnair will also do this from 2024. IAG 
Loyalty continues to enhance its business 
with new initiatives including the first 
Avios-only flights.

As a Group we will also focus on 
developing and leveraging our portfolio 
of strategic airline partnerships, which 
drive further asset-light growth for 
the Group and value to our airlines 
and customers. Joint Businesses play 
a key role in this. 

This improved financial position has 
enabled us to invest on behalf of our 
customers into our brands including 
products, services and IT, as well as 
adding 32 new fuel-efficient aircraft to 
the fleet. Our airlines continued to 
recover with capacity in the fourth 
quarter at 98.6% of 2019 levels across the 
Group. Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling 
operated higher levels of capacity than 
2019, with British Airways 9.9% lower 
than in 2019, due to the later reopening 
of Asia Pacific routes, with further 
recovery expected in 2024.

Our strategy for delivering world-
class margins 
This performance demonstrates that our 
strategy is working. In November, we 
gathered investors, shareholders, 
sell-side analysts, lenders and advisers 
to talk about the future of the Group, in 
our first Capital Markets Day since 2019. 
We shared our strategic imperatives 
going forward. Firstly, we will strengthen 
our core, driving value from the 
leadership positions of our airlines in our 
core markets of the US, Latin America 
and domestic Spain, and from our 
world-class brands. Secondly, we will 
drive earnings growth through asset-
light businesses, enabling IAG Loyalty to 
reach its full potential within the Group 
and leveraging our strategic airline 
partnerships. Thirdly, we will ensure that 
IAG is a sustainable business for the long 
term, with disciplined capital allocation, 
a robust balance sheet and delivery of 
our net zero target by 2050, enabled by 
IAG’s proven structure and business 
model. All of this will be underpinned by 
a focus on delivering Group-wide 
transformation, driving efficiencies and 
innovation.

Strengthening our core 
We will continue to develop our 
leadership positions and hubs. IAG 
operates in some of the world’s largest 
and most attractive aviation markets. 
The total market to and from Europe 
is worth around €180 billion per annum 
in revenue. The Group’s passenger traffic 
is in the largest and most attractive 

“We are looking for new 
technologies to help us 
elevate our customer 
experience and operations, 
such as digitised services 
for friction-free travel and 
new product offerings.”

Financial StatementsCorporate GovernanceStrategic ReportChief Executive Officer’s review continued

In 2023, the Atlantic Joint Business 
enabled further investment in our 
customer experience, with British 
Airways, Iberia and American Airlines 
co-locating at JFK Airport. The Group 
expanded its Joint Business with Qatar 
Airways too, the largest in the world 
by number of countries, with the 
addition of Iberia and launch of the 
Madrid-Doha route. 

Operating under a strengthened 
financial and sustainability 
framework
We always said that our unique business 
model would deliver resilience in the 
case of a downturn, and that was proven 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, 
we have improved the financial 
foundations of IAG which is evident in 
our full year results. In 2024, we will 
ensure that our balance sheet stays 
strong and that we are disciplined with 
our capital allocation. IAG is committed 
to delivering world-class operating 
margins and returns, and in November 
we announced our medium-term 
ambition to deliver 12-15% operating 
margins and 13-16% returns on invested 
capital. At the same time, we will retain 
the focus on building resilience into our 
operations. We will do this by making 
targeted investments, particularly in 
IT as well as by driving efficiencies. 
We will also continue to invest 
in sustainability.

Sustainability remains a top priority
IAG has always been a leader on the 
path to net zero, being the first airline 
group globally to commit to net zero 
by 2050. We are further committed 
to our goal of meeting 10% of our 
fuel needs with Sustainable Aviation 
Fuels (SAF) by 2030. We have a clear 
pathway to achieving these targets 
which includes more efficient aircraft, 
SAF and carbon removals. 

Our Group keeps working with 
producers to secure our airlines’ SAF 
needs as soon as possible. An example 
of this is our collaboration with Nova 
Pangaea. We are investing in and 
working closely with the business, which 
is building the UK’s first waste-to-SAF 
facility in Teesside. Also, we are looking 
forward to taking sustainable fuel 
directly from LanzaJet in the US, the 
world’s first alcohol-to-jet production 
facility, which opened in 2024. In the UK 
and Spain, we participate in initiatives 
such as Jet Zero Council and Alianza 
para la Sostenibilidad del Transporte 
Aéreo which aim to develop a SAF 
industry in both countries. 

We are doing all we can to achieve our 
targets, but we need all stakeholders in 
the aviation ecosystem to work together 
to enable the low-carbon transition. 
In particular, the industry urgently 
requires EU and UK policies to 
incentivise the production of SAF 
in Europe. 

Underpinned by Group 
transformation
Our performance in all areas of the 
strategy is supported by our Group-wide 
transformation programme. 
Transformation is embedded in every 
business in IAG. By transformation we 
mean fundamental change that drives 
results. We are looking at all areas of our 
businesses in forensic detail, particularly 
everything that impacts the customer 
experience. 

British Airways has a significant focus 
on transformation with 600 individual 
projects designed to enhance the 
customer experience and increase 
operational resilience and efficiency, with 
a particular focus on ‘on-time 
performance’. The airline is investing a 
significant amount in transforming its IT 
and commercial platforms, in its 
customer proposition and in its 
operations, particularly at London 
Heathrow.

Both Iberia and Vueling have been 
recognised among Europe’s most 
punctual airlines and they provide 
examples to peers in the Group of 
how they have transformed operations 
and harnessed technology to improve 
‘on-time performance’. Vueling is 
focusing on enhancing its digital offer, 
and Iberia on updating its long-haul 
economy and premium economy cabins 
on its Airbus A350 fleet, to further 
improve customer experience. 

We are also actively exploring the new 
wave of technology available to the 
Group through the development of 
artificial intelligence, harnessing the 
specialist skills of teams in IAG Tech, 
which the whole Group can benefit from.

People powering transformation
This Group-wide transformation 
programme is driven by our people, 
motivated by our purpose. We hold 
innovation, commitment, care for people, 
responsibility, pragmatism, execution, 
ambition and resilience as key values that 
enable us to fulfil our purpose.

Our front-line people are the ones that 
deliver the differentiated customer 
service that is critical to the success of 
businesses. 

During the year, IAG businesses have 
hired over 13,000 people, which means 
we are now back to the size of our 
organisation in 2019. The volume and 
quality of applications we have received 
continues to show the strength of 
not only our brands, but the career 
opportunities that aviation has to offer. 
We are pleased that in 2023, IAG 
airlines were able to sign multi-year 
pay agreements with almost all their 
union groups.

Training schemes like British Airways’ 
Speedbird Academy, the third edition 
of Iberia’s Cadet Programme, and the 
Aer Lingus Future Pilot Programme are 

some of the best opportunities available 
for aspiring pilots, as these schemes 
include covering the significant cost 
of training for those who cannot afford 
it. These initiatives not only provide 
opportunity for those from 
lower-income backgrounds, but also 
allow us to ensure we are well resourced 
for pilots, going into the future.

IAG also made progress towards 
increasing the number of women 
in senior leadership positions, and 
we are on track to meet our target 
of 40% of senior leadership roles to be 
held by women by 2025.

Our Group model allows us to offer 
senior leaders a unique chance for 
progression across different businesses. 
The CEOs of our airlines have all come 
from other leadership positions within 
the Group.

The challenges ahead
We know the year ahead could be 
challenging for aviation. The world 
is facing geopolitical conflict, 
macroeconomic uncertainty, and of 
course 2024 will be a significant year 
politically with millions of people going 
to the polls, including in the UK and 
US as well as elections for the European 
Parliament.

During 2023 we have faced persistent 
issues with air traffic control strikes as 
well as the NATS outage in August 
which led to the cancellation of around a 
quarter of flights from all UK airports in 
a single day, affecting roughly 250,000 
customers, across all of the aviation 
sector. In 2024, we anticipate ongoing 
challenges from air traffic control strikes 
and restrictions which could cause 
delays and disruption across Europe. 

In conclusion, our strategy gives 
us confidence
Despite the potential for further 
headwinds, we are confident that our 
strategy will ensure that IAG continues 
to transform and develop in 2024. 
In fact, the challenges ahead inspire us 
to accelerate on our strategy. This is 
all underpinned by embedding a culture 
of transformation which encourages 
efficiency and innovative thinking. 
Transformation for IAG is about 
fundamental, structural change across 
all our operations delivering a measurable 
impact. These outcomes will improve 
the way we work and enable us to keep 
delivering for our people, customers, 
shareholders and in sustainability.

Sharing 
our strategy 
for the future

On 21 November 2023, 
we hosted a Capital 
Markets Day for the first 
time since 2019 at our 
Waterside offices 
in London. 

The event was well attended, with 
sell-side analysts, investors and lenders 
present to learn more about our 
strategic priorities and prospects. 
The event also gave attendees a chance 
to meet our management team in 
person, who then set out how we will 
transform the organisation to deliver 
sustainable growth and world-class 
operating margins and maximise total 
shareholder returns. A wide range of 
managers from across the Group were 
also present to give more depth and 
insight for attendees on an informal 
basis during breaks from the 
presentations.

IAG CEO Luis Gallego opened the event 
with a presentation of IAG’s investment 
case, which summarised IAG’s strategy. 
In particular this will focus on three key 
strategic imperatives: strengthening 
our core, driving earnings growth 
through asset-light businesses and 
operating under a strengthened 
financial and sustainability framework, 
all underpinned by Group-wide 
transformation.

IAG’s Management Committee also 
presented the Group’s plans for the 
medium term from 2024 to 2026.

Maximising total shareholder returns 
The strategy will enable IAG to deliver 
world-class operating margins and 
returns on invested capital. The Group 
has a high-quality and increasingly 
diverse revenue stream, while 
transformation plans will result in further 
revenue enhancements and cost 
efficiencies. 

This will help deliver the financial targets 
that we have set ourselves:

•  operating profit margins of 12%-15%
•  return on invested capital of 13%-16%
•  accretive ASK growth of 4%-5% 

between 2024 and 2026

•  leverage through the cycle of less than 

1.8x

There was a Q&A session after the 
presentations, in which all members 
of the Management Committee 
participated.

The day included demonstrations of 
some of the customer products available 
at British Airways and Iberia, including 
business cabin seats and food and 
beverages, as well as proprietary 
technology showing real-time IAG 
aircraft movements on the ground and 
in the air and a simulator from Vueling. 
Cabin crew from all our airlines were 
present, hosting our guests.

“IAG is transforming its 
businesses to be more 
efficient and resilient 
and to drive sustainable 
earnings. Our businesses 
are sharing best 
practices to deliver 
transformational value.”

All information on our Capital 
Markets Day is available 
on our website, including a 
webcast recording of the day.

Central platform 

Allow our airlines to benefit from scale and world-class expertise

IAG, as the parent company, defines 
the Group ambition and drives its 
long-term strategy. Its independence 
from the operating companies enables 
IAG to set performance targets for 
these, manage their progress, oversee 
their transformation initiatives, and 
efficiently allocate capital within 
the Group. IAG supports intra-Group 
coordination, best practices sharing 
and talent management, facilitating the 
capture of synergies. Our model also 
allows the Group to take part more 
effectively in industry consolidation, 

with IAG ensuring inorganic options are 
aligned with the Group’s strategy 
and providing a central platform to 
the benefit of new operating companies 
joining the Group.

The Group’s structure allows our 
brands to focus their efforts on their 
addressable markets, customer 
proposition, cultural identity, commercial 
strategy and their industrial relations, 
while its scale supports innovation and 
investment in new products and services 
to enhance our operating companies’ 
customer experience. 

The Group’s portfolio sits on a central 
platform, which drives efficiency and 
transformation. The IAG central platform 
leads collective efforts for the Group 
to be at the forefront of innovation 
and sustainability in the airline industry, 
by supporting and scaling top emerging 
technologies in travel and aviation 
and working towards ambitious 
sustainability targets.

Strategic imperatives expanded

Strengthening  
our core

How we create value:
Growing our portfolio of global 
leadership positions and 
strengthening our portfolio of 
world-class brands and operations 

Our activity in 2023
In 2023, following a strong demand 
recovery environment across the 
industry, the Group has kept its focus 
on continuing to strengthen its core 
by maintaining and growing its global 
leadership positions and strengthening 
our portfolio of world-class brands.

1. Growing our portfolio of global 
leadership positions
Our brands have experienced sustained 
strong demand that has driven positive 
unit revenues across all regions. With 
a resilient leisure and premium leisure 
demand environment, Aer Lingus, Iberia, 
LEVEL Spain and Vueling have managed 
to grow capacity ahead of 2019 levels, 
whilst British Airways’ recovery remains 
slower driven by a softer business travel 
environment after the pandemic and 
limited capacity to fly east. The Group 
operating companies have capitalised 
on the positive demand landscape to grow 
organically in our core markets. For 
example, Iberia has focused on increasing 
capacity on primary cities in Latin America, 
such as Bogota, Lima and Mexico City, 
operating the airline’s busiest schedule to 
the region thus far. British Airways also 
started a new year-round service to 
Cincinnati and announced the resumption 
of Abu Dhabi in 2024, whilst Aer Lingus 
announced the resumption of Minneapolis 
and the launch of a new direct service to 
Denver for 2024. Vueling put a special 
emphasis on de-seasonalisation during the 
2023 winter season through increased 
utilisation, adding more capacity to winter 
sun destinations, such as the Canary 
Islands and flying almost 37 million in 2023, 
a Vueling record.

2. Strengthening our portfolio of 
world-class brands and operations
Throughout 2023, we have continued 
to improve and transform our brands 
to be able to provide our customers 
with an unrivalled proposition and reach 
the full potential of our businesses 
in the long term. The Group is 
embedding transformation across all our 
business portfolio, looking at all business 
areas in forensic detail, building 
on our strong foundations of previous 
execution to drive a step-change 
in revenue, costs and operations. 

Despite the air traffic control (ATC) 
challenges in Europe, which have 
resulted in frequent passenger 
disruption, our airlines’ investments 
in transformation have delivered 
enhancements in operational efficiency. 
For example, Iberia managed to achieve 
continued global leadership in on-time 
performance (OTP) by investing in 
multiple efficiency initiatives, including 
increasing crew resources and 
coordination between scheduling 
and operations, whilst Vueling attained 
an improvement of more than 4.7 
percentage points in OTP, ahead of its 
transformation targets. British Airways 
faced punctuality challenges over the 
year, driven by both internal and 
external factors, but started seeing 
gradual improvements from the fourth 
quarter after the implementation of new 
initiatives such as the re-shape of 
London Heathrow Terminal 5 minimum 
connection times, the optimisation of 
scheduled block hours and the 
smoothing of the schedule to even out 
handling workload.

Our brands also continued to improve 
the customer experience by investing 
in enhancing our product across all the 
journey touchpoints. For example, 
Iberia rolled out its ‘Next’ suite-style 
seat with direct aisle access on its Airbus 
A350 business cabins and redesigned 
the catering proposition across cabins 
on long-haul flights, including an 
additional meal in economy and 
premium economy. British Airways 
implemented numerous customer 
initiatives, such as trialling biometrics to 
speed up the boarding process, and 
continued to fit its new business cabin 
seat, the Club Suite, onto existing 
long-haul aircraft.

The Group also remains committed 
to invest in the digitalisation of the 
customer journey to provide our 
customers with a more personalised 
and elevated travel experience. 
During the year, Aer Lingus delivered 
a significant transformation in its 
Customer Contact Centre by investing 
in technology, redesigning its process 
workflow and implementing bot 
automation that have brought the 
average wait time below two minutes 
and increased customer satisfaction 
rates by 30% compared with 2022. 
British Airways initiated the 
re-platforming of its website and the 
British Airways app, which allow for 
deeper personalisation, full online 
serviceability, end-to-end trip 
management and a fast product release 
cycle. Vueling implemented a new social 
media platform to make case 
management more efficient and 
partnered with industry-leading 
technology organisations to digitalise 
customer care and disruption 
management.

Our priorities for 2024 
During 2024, the Group will aim to 
continue strengthening our core markets 
and hubs where we have a geographical 
advantage and cultural links, including 
the US, Latin America and Spain, whilst 
continuing to explore the potential of 
future profit pools.

IAG will also continue participating 
in the industry’s consolidation process 
when value-accretive merger and 
acquisition (M&A) opportunities arise. 
We aim to complete the Air Europa 
acquisition by the end of 2024, subject to 
receipt of regulatory clearance, which will 
enable the Group to tap into new 
markets in Latin America and increase 
global connectivity at the Madrid hub.

Our operating companies will remain 
focused on delivering the transformation 
plans for their different business 
segments and accelerating digital 
transformation, which will ensure the 
Group remains well-positioned to 
continue to create value for our 
customers and all our stakeholders.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

 
Driving earnings 
growth through 
asset-light businesses

How we create value:
Growing IAG Loyalty and further 
developing and leveraging our 
strategic airline partnerships 

Our activity in 2023
Alongside strengthening our core flying 
operations, in 2023 the Group has 
focused on driving a larger portion 
of asset-light earnings into our portfolio, 
generating in turn additional value for 
our airlines, our customers and building 
a more robust, diversified and 
resilient business.

3. Growing IAG Loyalty
In 2023, IAG Loyalty leveraged its 
positive momentum and continued 
to contribute greatly to the Group. 
The strength of the business was 
reflected in record membership growth 
surpassing 8.2 million active members 
with heightened levels of member 
activity through increased levels 
of Avios collection and spend. 

This has been achieved through 
continuous investment in the customer 
proposition to drive deeper customer 
engagement and to deliver a strong 
contribution to the Group. We are 
continuing to develop our global loyalty 
currency, Avios. Following the adoption 
by Qatar Airways in 2022, Finnair was 
next to announce the adoption of Avios 
in early 2024, further building Avios’ 
position as a global currency. We 
successfully leverage our large portfolio 
of air and non-air partners who provide 
compelling collection opportunities for 
our customers in travel, retail or financial 
services. Our partnerships with 
American Express, Barclays and 
Santander continue to provide strong 
levels of external remuneration and we 
continue to expand new partnerships 
with, for example, partnerships launched 

with open-air retailer Bicester Village or 
World Duty Free. Redemption 
opportunities, meant to further enhance 
the utility of Avios for our customers, 
are also growing with the launch of 
Avios-only flights, which started in 
November 2023 with a flight to Sharm 
El Sheikh and the announcement 
of several more destinations in 2024. 
Additionally, this year we transitioned 
the Group’s loyalty programmes to a 
spend-based earn model to further 
support member engagement. 

4. Further developing and leveraging 
our strategic airline partnerships
During 2023, IAG continued to develop 
and leverage our portfolio of strategic 
airline partnerships, driving asset-light 
growth and incremental value. Our joint 
businesses provide our airlines and 
partners with the ability to develop 
a market-leading customer proposition 
through combined networks, loyalty 
reciprocity and an overall improved 
flying experience.

The Atlantic Joint Business (AJB) 
between IAG carriers and American 
Airlines is the leader in the highly 
attractive Europe-US market. In 2023, 
Aer Lingus continued advancing 
its integration in the AJB through 
codeshare expansion with American 
Airlines and improved loyalty benefits 
for customers. The AJB also continued 
to invest in our customer experience, 
with British Airways and Iberia now 
co-locating with American Airlines at 
JFK Airport in New York whilst offering 
a new premium check-in area, new 
lounges and an overall improved 
network connectivity and experience 
at the airport. 

The Group continued extracting value 
from its unique relationship with Qatar 
Airways. In addition to the joint business, 
it includes the joint loyalty currency 
Avios, the interline relationship between 
the Cargo businesses and leveraging 
of the combined size of IAG and Qatar 
Airways for joint procurement of an 
increasing number of categories. 
The joint business with Qatar Airways 
is the world’s largest in terms of 
countries covered. Iberia joined in 2023 
and launched a daily flight to Doha from 
Madrid, adding dozens of new 

destinations for Iberia customers 
connecting on to Qatar in Doha, a truly 
asset-light way of increasing Iberia’s 
footprint in Asia, Middle East, Africa 
and Oceania. We also continue to 
collaborate strongly on the loyalty side 
with Qatar Airways. For instance, 
IAG and Qatar launched a new joint 
co-brand credit card in India, further 
enhancing our footprint in the world’s 
most-populous country. 

The reopening of Asia saw British 
Airways rebuild its network to China 
and reactivate its joint business with 
China Southern, whilst the airline 
restored its network to Tokyo, part 
of the Siberian Joint Business with our 
partners Japan Airlines and Finnair. 

Our priorities for 2024 
In 2024, IAG Loyalty will continue 
to develop its capabilities and invest 
in its customer experience with the 
development of single Avios balances 
and improved member benefits. These 
will include additional Avios-only flights, 
enhanced pay-with-Avios capabilities 
with British Airways and improved 
redemption for hotels and car hires. 
We will also support Finnair’s adoption 
of Avios and in parallel explore 
opportunities with new partners 
to expand the global reach of Avios.

In 2024, the Group will continue 
to strengthen its airline partnerships 
to maintain our leading customer 
proposition with best-in-class product 
and a seamless customer journey. In our 
AJB we will enhance our joint loyalty 
proposition with aligned mileage accrual, 
explore further airport co-location 
opportunities and increase capacity 
to popular destinations. With Qatar 
Airways, our first focus will be to 
integrate Iberia into the Qatar Joint 
Business whilst we look for further 
opportunities to grow our network.

Operating under 
a strengthened 
financial and 
sustainability 
framework

How we create value:
Disciplined capital allocation 
and balance sheet management

Industry leader to net zero 

Our activity in 2023
This year we continued to experience 
volatility across the global economy. 
Regular increases in interest rates 
following record high inflation levels, 
and supply chain and operations 
disruptions, all aggravated by the wars 
in Ukraine and the Middle East, have 
impacted our businesses. Despite this, 
IAG’s companies demonstrated the 
ability to meet market demand, while 
carrying out transformation initiatives, 
resulting in a strong performance across 
the Group. We managed a robust 
recovery in our margins and balance 
sheet, which has allowed us to reinvest 
in the business, and reduce our debt.

5. Disciplined capital allocation and 
balance sheet management
In 2023, we have achieved a strong 
operating profit of €3,507 million for the 
full year, driven by strong demand and 
our teams’ efforts in revenue and cost 
transformation initiatives, helping 
to offset investment and inflation. 
On the revenue side, we have invested 
in commercial technology and skills, and 
upgraded customer journey experiences. 
On the cost side, we put a special focus 
into OTP and resilience to minimise 
disruption in a very challenging 
operating environment, and end-to-end 
process re-engineering, among 
other initiatives.

Following the past three challenging 
years, having a disciplined approach 
to capital allocation has been especially 
crucial. Our framework meets the needs 
of all stakeholders: investors, employees, 
customers and society; whilst our 
targets, like maintaining a lower than 
1.8x net leverage ratio through the cycle, 
ensure resilience and access to more 
favourable funding. This allows IAG 
to pursue our strategy by investing in 
the business, our customer experience, 
digital infrastructure and sustainability 
targets, whilst growing organically 
and/or inorganically if value-accretive 
opportunities exist and returning value 
to the shareholders. 

During 2023 we reduced our gross debt 
position by €3.9 billion, including the 
payment of a £2.0 billion (€2.3 billion) 
loan to British Airways partially 
guaranteed by the UKEF, and loans 
totalling €1.0 billion to Iberia and 
Vueling, partially backed by Spain’s ICO. 
Efforts to deleverage and improve 
operating performance contributed to 
both IAG and British Airways regaining 
their investment-grade credit ratings 
with S&P at the end of the third quarter 
of 2023.

6. Industry leader to net zero
Alongside a robust financial framework, 
creating a truly sustainable business 
is fundamental to our long-term growth. 
While aviation is essential to our global 
society, there is no denying that the 
industry must undergo great efforts 
to minimise its carbon footprint and 
fight climate change. IAG has led 
industry action on sustainability for over 
a decade, having been the first airline 
group worldwide to commit to net zero 
emissions by 2050. SAF is a key solution 
in our transition plan to net zero and we 
have committed to a target of 10% SAF 
use by 2030. 

We are continuously working towards 
our sustainability targets, having secured 
c.33% of our total committed SAF 
to date. This year, we have agreed deals 
with several SAF producers. An example 

is the UK’s Nova Pangaea Technologies, 
a clean-tech company developing 
advanced biofuels used to produce SAF 
from non-food agricultural waste and 
wood residues. IAG will support the 
building of its first waste-to-fuel 
commercial-scale production facility, 
and the UK’s first of its kind. 
Additionally, Microsoft co-funded IAG’s 
purchase of 14,700 tonnes of SAF, the 
largest co-funded purchase agreement 
of SAF for emissions reductions globally. 
Additionally, we continued to engage 
with cutting-edge technology companies 
such as ZeroAvia, i6 and Heirloom 
through our innovation accelerator 
Hangar 51, to provide multiple 
decarbonisation solutions. 

Our priorities for 2024 
During 2024, the Group will keep 
operating under a disciplined and resilient 
financial framework whilst investing in 
our strategy for the years to come and 
delivering on our sustainability targets. 

Using our financial framework, we plan 
to continue re-investing in the business, 
with an expected annual average capital 
expenditure of c.€4.5 billion for the next 
three years. This spending will further 
improve our product and customer 
proposition, supporting IAG in advancing 
with our fuel efficiency targets, 
and allowing the Group to continue 
to pursue sustainable growth.

In terms of our sustainability ambition, 
we will continue to work with the 
industry, technology start-ups and 
government institutions to further 
accelerate SAF production efforts, and 
explore new technologies and ways to 
accelerate the industry decarbonisation 
process. This includes maintaining our 
efforts with the UK and EU governments 
to persuade them to commit and invest 
in more SAF production.

Overall, IAG is committed to ensure 
sustainable growth and value creation 
for all our stakeholders, investing 
in our customers, people and the 
broader society while we create 
long-term value for our shareholders.

Definition and purpose
Operating margin is the operating result 
before exceptional items as a 
percentage of revenue. We use this 
indicator to measure the efficiency and 
profitability of our business and the 
financial performance of the individual 
operating companies within the Group.

Performance
The Group’s RoIC improved to 14.8% 
from 4.6% in 2022 reflecting the Group’s 
strong operating performance, with 
EBITDA before exceptional items of 
€5.6 billion. Invested capital was 8% 
higher, reflecting 34 aircraft deliveries 
and the investment in customer product 
and IT during the period. The weighted 
average age of fleet was marginally 
lower at 11.0 years compared to 11.3 
years in 2022, reflecting the net impact 
of the ageing of the existing fleet, older 
aircraft withdrawn from service and new 
aircraft delivered in 2023.

Performance
The Group’s operating margin before 
exceptional items recovered to 11.9% 
from 5.4% in 2022. Total revenue rose by 
€6.4 billion to €29.5 billion, reflecting a 
22.6% increase in capacity versus 2022 
together with a load factor 3.5 points 
higher and yields (per revenue 
passenger kilometre) 3.8% higher. Cargo 
revenue was down 28.4% on 2022, 
driven by lower yields with cargo 
volumes 17.2% higher. Other revenue 
was up €494 million from 2022 
reflecting growth of IAG Loyalty and 
recovery of Iberia’s third-party 
maintenance business. Non-fuel costs 
were down 4.4% on a unit basis and unit 
fuel costs were 0.7% higher than 2022.

Definition and purpose
Gross capex (capital expenditure) is 
defined as the acquisition of property, 
plant and equipment, and intangible 
assets reported in the Group’s 
consolidated cash flow statement and 
includes fleet, customer product, IT, ETS 
allowances and infrastructure, including 
those assets initially purchased and then 
subject to subsequent sale and 
leaseback transactions and recognised 
as right of use assets. We track the 
planned capital expenditure through our 
business planning cycle to ensure it is in 
line with achieving our other financial 
targets.

Performance
Gross capex for 2023 was €3.5 billion. 
Fleet and fleet-related capex 
represented 77% of the total capital 
expenditure and included final delivery 
payments related to 27 aircraft, together 
with pre-delivery payments and 
maintenance spend. Other spend 
includes customer product, property 
and IT investments, together with ETS 
allowances. In addition, the Group took 
delivery of seven aircraft on direct 
leases, including one that was originally 
planned as a delivery from the aircraft 
manufacturer. Direct leases do not result 
in capital expenditure for the Group.

For the KPIs, 2019 comparatives are shown to give a benchmark against the most recent year 
before the disruption brought about by the impact of COVID-19.

Definition and purpose
Free cash flow is the cash generated 
in the year, defined as the net cash flows 
from operating activities less the cash 
flows associated with the acquisition 
of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets. It represents the 
cash-generating ability of the Group to 
support operations and maintain its 
capital assets, and is monitored by 
the Group in making both investment 
and capital decisions. 

Performance
The Group’s free cash flow for 2023 was 
€1.3 billion, €0.3 billion up from 2022 
driven by strong cash flows from 
operating activities at €4.9 billion which 
reflect EBITDA performance and gross 
capex for the period €0.3 billion lower 
than in 2022. 

Performance
Adjusted earnings per share was 50.6 € 
cents compared to 5.6 € cents in 2022, 
driven by the strong operating 
performance, with net non-operating 
costs also lower by €0.4 billion 
reflecting lower net interest costs and a 
favourable impact of net retranslation 
credits in the year driven primarily by 
the weakening of the US dollar. The 
number of dilutive shares fell in 2023, 
reflecting the full-year impact of the 
repayment of the IAG €500 million 
convertible bond in 2022. From 2020 
the IAG number of shares increased 
from 2.0 billion to 5.0 billion as a result 
of the rights issue IAG completed in 
September 2020.

Definition and purpose
Net debt to EBITDA before exceptional 
items (leverage) is calculated as  
long-term borrowings (both current 
and non-current), less cash, cash 
equivalents and other current 
interest-bearing deposits at 
31 December, which is divided by 
EBITDA before exceptional items for the 
year. IAG uses this measure to monitor 
leverage, to assess financial headroom 
against our target maximum leverage of 
1.8 times over the cycle.

Performance
The Group’s leverage improved to 1.7 
times from 3.1 times in 2022, driven 
by strong EBITDA before exceptional 
items of €5.6 billion on net debt lower 
by €1.1 billion. During the year gross debt 
reduced by €3.9 billion to €16.1 billion, 
driven by the repayment of €4.0 billion 
of non-aircraft borrowings partially 
offset by the net increase of aircraft 
lease liabilities in the period.

Definition and purpose
At IAG a transactional NPS is measured: 
customers respond about their likelihood 
of recommending an IAG operating 
carrier no more than seven days after 
taking a flight. Including NPS targets in 
the Group’s employee bonus scheme has 
driven a stronger focus on improving the 
customer experience which, together 
with customer advocacy, drives 
competitive advantage, leading to faster 
organic growth.

Performance
In 2023, NPS increased by 0.2 points 
compared to 2022. Positive impacts can 
be attributed to substantial investment 
in our cabins and cabin product, the 
enhancement of food and drink offering, 
the effort to digitalise the customer 
journey, and the improvements in 
customer care. On-time performance 
(OTP) was negatively impacted by 
disruptions, stemming from diverse 
factors such as air traffic control failures, 
strikes, adverse weather events, supply 
chain challenges, and baggage issues 
across key airports. Our operating 
companies responded proactively to 
these challenges through initiatives and 
transformation plans aimed at improving 
OTP and all baggage-related processes, 
among others. 

For the KPIs, 2019 comparatives are shown to give a benchmark against the most recent year 
before the disruption brought about by the impact of COVID-19.

Stakeholder engagement

Connecting with  
our stakeholders

Our key stakeholders
We believe that IAG thrives 
when the interests of our 
different stakeholders are 
appropriately balanced 
so that they all share in our 
success. It is therefore 
important that we fully 
understand all 
stakeholders’ priorities, 
expectations and concerns.

Our long-term commitment to 
sustainability and corporate social 
responsibility is embedded in all we do 
at a Group and operating company level, 
from our interactions with our customers 
through to employees and shareholders. 
We do not identify our communities 
or the environment as distinct 
stakeholder groups as they are integral 
to the way in which we work. Our aim is 
to be a force for good in the communities 
in which we operate and, in so doing, 
create value for all our stakeholders. 
More detailed information is provided 
in the operating companies and 
Sustainability sections of this report. 

The nature of our business lends itself 
to continuous dialogue with a wide group 
of stakeholders, whilst considering 
our environmental and social impact. 
Set out below is an overview of our key 
stakeholders, their relevance for IAG’s 
business model and strategy, the manner 
in which the Group has engaged, key 
topics of interest, and the challenges as 
well as outcomes of our engagement. 

Our statement in relation to section 172(1) 
of the UK Companies Act, 2006, as well 
as further information on our 
engagement with shareholders and our 
workforce, is set out in the Corporate 
Governance section of this report.

Customers

Our customers are central to the 
success of IAG. Customers choose 
us primarily for our extensive 
network and schedule and because 
they trust our brands. We fly to five 
continents. Through our wide range 
of partnerships, our customers 
benefit from an even larger global 
network covering most countries in 
the world.

Key metrics
NPS 

18.6

+0.2 pts vly

Other metrics used to track engagement include: 

•  Customer satisfaction (CSAT) – rates 

a customer’s experience on key touch points 
in their customer journey 

•  NPS and CSAT inform business priorities 

during the business planning stage, helping 
to prioritise internal initiatives to drive 
satisfaction improvements 

•  Claims and complaints – a Group consolidated 
figure provides deeper insights into customer 
challenges and is used to assess the 
effectiveness of efforts to address concerns 

•  Contact centre key performance indicators – 
help assess the efficiency, effectiveness and 
quality of customer interactions

Why they are important

•  We aim to provide unrivalled customer 

propositions and a portfolio of 
world-class brands targeting specific 
demand spaces and travel occasions

•  Passenger revenues, including fares 

and ancillaries, are the most important 
source of revenue for IAG

•  Delivering outstanding customer 
experience at all levels of the 
business and all brands will give 
us a leading position 

•  Recognising our most loyal customers 
through loyalty programmes, earning 
rewards on a broad range of items 
when flying with our airlines and 
partners, creates value for both IAG 
and our customers, and builds the 
relationship

How we engaged

Key topics

•  Daily “Customer Voice” survey is sent to customers who have recently flown with us, 

•  Self-service and self-management 

capabilities, particularly when there 
is disruption 

•  Punctuality and operational resilience

•  Digitalisation of customer journey 

•  Sustainability 

•  Expansion of our partnerships

collecting feedback on their experience

•  Customer feedback through a variety of channels (contact centres, social media, feedback 
from customer-facing employees) and partners (crews, lounge colleagues and ground 
handling agents) help us understand key pain points throughout the customers’ journeys

•  Brand surveys are done to understand and meet the needs and expectations of our 

customers 

•  Claims and complaints are raised through different channels and monitored to 

accommodate our customers and enable action where necessary 

•  Contact Centre services and other digital channels, for example chat bots on 

our websites or WhatsApp 24/7, are used so that customers can reach out when needed 

•  Communicating information including latest changes in service or product enhancements 
through various channels, including websites, e-mails and dynamic social media accounts

•  Guidance and a high standard of customer care throughout the customer journey from 

both airport and on-board colleagues

British Airways – 
proactive customer care
In 2023, British Airways launched a 
customer care initiative to revolutionise 
our service by proactively addressing 
our customers' needs. Our dedicated 
team focuses on identifying opportunities 
for proactive interventions. Utilising 
specific channels and innovative 
practices, we aim to address issues 
before customers are even aware or 
before they feel the need to contact us. 
This proactive approach has started 
to become standard practice with 
our team reaching out, seemingly 
unexpectedly, to resolve 
impending issues.

One significant improvement is our ability 
to support customers while they are 
in the air, a service we call 'Connected 
Teams'. This addresses a previous gap 
in our service and allows us to provide 
assistance at 35,000 feet. 

This new service has already supported 
multiple onward passengers who risked 
missing their connecting flights. Through 
Connected Teams, cabin crew have been 
able to request and obtain flight and gate 
information for tight connections, passing 
this on to passengers, and helping them 
get to their new gate as efficiently as 
possible on landing.

We are committed to identifying and 
resolving issues before they impact the 
customer experience.

Challenges

Outcomes

•  Loss of customer loyalty – dissatisfied 
customers are more likely to switch 
to competitors

•  Reputation and brand equity – unhappy 
customers are prone to sharing negative 
experiences, which can harm the airlines’ 
reputation and brand image 

•  Decreased growth – negative reviews 
may make it difficult for the airline to 
attract new customers, impacting growth 

•  Financial risks – there are costs 

associated with addressing customer 
complaints, providing compensation 
and marketing efforts to repair the 
brand image

•  Employee satisfaction and productivity 

– poor customer experiences may affect 
employee morale and job satisfaction 
leading to lower productivity

•  Customer experience – although our 

teams work diligently to elevate 
customer experience through investment 
in digitalisation and customer care, we 
continue to identify opportunities for 
improvement and learning, particularly in 
areas such as ensuring timely and 
comprehensive communication to 
customers about schedule changes

Feedback is key to enhancing our customer experience. IAG’s holistic approach uses 
all available data from various channels to inform product and service strategy decisions. 
Data is continuously analysed, supplementing it with additional customer research when 
necessary. 2023 outcomes include those set out below:

•  Digitalisation of the customer journey to improve ability to self-service. All operating 
companies invested to digitalise the customer journey. Examples include Iberia’s 
incorporation of GenAI to its WhatsApp and voice bot channels, and smart voice 
assistance to call centres; British Airways introduced a conversational AI solution to the 
call centre system; Vueling implemented new digital disruption solutions, e.g. launch 
of self-management and the deployment of i-coupon; Aer Lingus is investing in digital 
self-service and disruption management capabilities through a mobile first approach

•  Delivering best-in-class customer care included the formation of a new ‘Proactive 

Customer Care’ team in British Airways (see example below), or the second iteration 
of Iberia’s ‘Todo empieza conmigo’, a programme focused on the delivery of cultural 
transformation and warm, customer-centric service. Aer Lingus and Vueling are 
conducting training for cabin crew and other customer-facing employees. Vueling 
streamlined its refund and compensation process

•  Improved WiFi on long-haul flights through collaboration with providers to launch 
new satellites and enhance connectivity resulting in a notable improvement in 
customer satisfaction

•  Food and drink propositions continue to be improved including current offerings 

and introducing complimentary products 

•  In-flight service improvements included upgrading and significantly increasing in-flight 

entertainment systems content, better quality economy headsets and a new 
informative video at the start of long-haul flights to clarify the service for that flight. 
The number of public announcements on early morning / late night flights ('whisper 
flights') were reduced resulting in improved customer satisfaction

•  Baggage-related processes were improved including customer notifications about 
baggage arrival or proactive delivery assistance; retrofitting of overhead bins to 
address customer and crew complaints about the lack of trolley bag space on narrow-
body aircraft; enhanced communication of baggage allowances through clearer web 
and email communication, targeted push notifications, and collaborating with agencies 
for accurate customer information

Iberia – 
WhatsApp Holistic Strategy
Iberia uses WhatsApp to improve 
engagement and communication with 
customers. A chat bot developed using AI 
and machine learning recognises customer 
intent with 95% accuracy and is prepared 
to answer the most frequently asked 
questions. Usage has grown 300% in the 
last three years, reaching more than 
850,000 sessions in 2023. For some 
requests, customers prefer human contact, 
and an experienced pool of agents in the 
customer centres is ready to engage when 
required, and ensures a ‘fast track’ for 
Business customers or anyone that has 
suffered a disruption. During 2023 more 
than 250,000 customers used live chat.

This year, using real-time operational data, 
Iberia deployed proactive notifications to 
its most loyal customers with relevant 
information about their journey. Since the 
launch this summer, more than 200,000 
notifications were sent to customers. 
Following this strategy, two new customer-
centric initiatives were introduced: 

•  WhatsApp Premium, a dedicated channel 
and 100% human assisted for Top Tier 
frequent flyers from the IB Plus loyalty 
programme, and 

•  WhatsApp Crew, an agile channel for crew 

to escalate customer issues and get 
real-time responses for them, generating a 
WOW effect while flying with proactive 
communication for the customers.

strategy, prompting each company 
to establish effective ways to 
engage, listen and act on employee 
feedback. Our employees shape our 
business and are representative of 
our international footprint. We are 
proud of the diversity within our 
operating companies and the 
progress made on our journey to 
making IAG more diverse and

Challenges 

Outcomes

•  IAG and each of the operating companies and platform 
businesses have strengths, challenges and opportunities 
related to their individual contexts. Themes of culture, 
management practices and employee engagement are 
reflected in the six-monthly OHI survey results and captured 
through other employee communication channels, including 
any company-specific engagement surveys. These outputs 
contribute to the creation of company-specific people and 
culture plans

•  In the context of 2023, we continued to build capacity and 

improve the resilience and flexibility of our operations, reflected 
in increasing resourcing levels and flexibility to reflect 
seasonality

Suppliers 

IAG is dependent on the performance 
of key suppliers that provide goods 
and services to our customers and 
the Group including aircraft, engine, 
maintenance, airport operations and 
catering suppliers. 

IAG Procurement, a centralised 
Group function, provides a supplier 
management framework to manage

Challenges 

Outcomes

•  Delays in the delivery of aircraft and maintenance, repair and 

overhaul (MRO) activities on existing aircraft and engines from: 

•  Secured access to more fuel-efficient aircraft with lower carbon 
emissions, reduced community noise and improved air quality

•  supply chain issues; 

•  One of two airline groups given ’A’ rating for supplier 

•  design and manufacturing capacity; and 

•  impact of extended regulatory certification processes 

in the US and EU.

•  Supply-side limits for new aircraft through inability of aircraft 
and engine manufacturers to meet demand. Although IAG is 
well positioned, there are potential impacts from other airlines 
on lease renewals and limiting flexibility in aircraft selection

•  Suppliers must adhere to the Supplier Code of Conduct which 
emphasises the importance of sustainability and fair treatment 
of employees

•  Prior to onboarding, and at least annually thereafter, suppliers 

undergo screening for relevant compliance risks, such as 
anti-bribery and corruption, export controls and trade 
sanctions, and key suppliers are subject to financial risk 
screening. Where necessary, mitigation plans are put in place 
for suppliers identified as having potentially higher levels of risk. 
Issues are flagged to the relevant risk owners within the Group 
to take appropriate action

•  To meet the requirements of the Supplier Code of Conduct and 
legislation, including the UK Modern Slavery Act, suppliers are 
subject to a risk assessment supported by a third party 
(SEDEX) and if necessary, an audit process. Through SEDEX 
we have accessed 38 relevant audits in 2023

•  Risk-based third-party due diligence including screenings, 
external reports, interviews and site visits serve to identify, 
manage and mitigate bribery and corruption risks 

•  Ongoing assessment of sustainable performance to drive 
change and improvement throughout the supply chain 

•  Risk of achieving environmental and social targets for Scope 1, 

2 and 3 targets 

•  Third-party risk management is key, with a particular focus on 
cybersecurity, and suppliers are required to adhere to IAG’s 
security requirements

•  Additional maintenance requirements for fleet using Pratt & 
Whitney GTF engines. Refer to the Regulatory Environment 
section for further information 

engagement for 2022 by the Carbon Disclosure Project (‘CDP’). 
CDP stated that ‘Companies have much greater potential to 
reduce global emissions when they engage with and cascade 
action down their supply chains’. The shared carbon targets drive 
levels of collaboration and innovation across IAG and IAG GBS, 
key to delivering change to meet targets 

•  Engagement on long-term engine maintenance arrangements 
with key engine suppliers mitigated the impact of supply chain 
challenges on MRO operations of the Group’s airlines. Worked 
closely with suppliers to protect deliveries, replan fleets to cope 
with extended ground times or delivery delays

•  Continued to secure access to new short-haul fleet with firm 

orders and options addressing the inability of manufacturers to 
meet demands. We acquired both new and used leased long-haul 
aircraft where appropriate, and secured option delivery positions 
for later this decade

•  New risk-monitoring technologies will identify existing and future 
supplier risks and enable a proactive, joint approach to anticipate 
and mitigate risks through targeted action plans

•  A Group-wide third-party risk management process was put in 

place to integrate cybersecurity due diligence into procurement 
sourcing and contracting processes, including ongoing 
monitoring of the Group's top 200 suppliers. An inventory of 
suppliers presenting cybersecurity, information or operational 
risks enables tracking of different engagements with suppliers 
throughout the Group 

•  A joint procurement partnership was created with another airline 
for the purchase of the latest design aircraft tyres to optimise 
costs, improve product quality and reduce carbon emissions from 
longer lifespan tyres with less waste generated from replacement; 
they are lighter, burning less fuel and reducing emissions; and 
use fewer raw materials in production, reducing the 
environmental impact

•  Established a steering committee to consider issues arising from 
the use of Pratt & Whitney GTF engines and oversee action to 
mitigate operational disruption and offset cost impacts

Group Procurement breathes new life into  
old uniforms
In 2023, Group Procurement supported the roll out of new 
uniforms for British Airways and Iberia. As a result, we needed 
a sustainable solution for the responsible disposal or reuse 
of the old uniforms. By engaging with existing suppliers and 
proactively sourcing specialists in the area of fabric recycling, 
Group Procurement expects to be able to give a second life to 
the unneeded garments, by exploring options to turn the fabric 
into customer blankets, remove logos and repurpose items to 
be donated to those in need, or to fashion aircraft seat covers 
from the remnant fabrics.

Outcomes

•  Successfully communicating IAG's investment case to drive 

wider share ownership and share price appreciation against a 
backdrop of wider macroeconomic and geopolitical 
uncertainty

•  Building relationships with existing and new investors to 

understand their priorities and to ensure support for strategy 
and management proposals

•  Funding mechanisms, including dividend policy decisions, may 

not suit all shareholder or financial stakeholder profiles, 
requiring a balancing of shareholder and financial stakeholder 
views with the corporate interest

•  Increased focus on climate change and diversity has potential 
reputation impacts and requires consideration of shareholder 
expectations 

•  IAG held a CMD in November and the presentations and further 
details of the day are set out in CMD page. There was a question-
and-answer session with all the members of the Management 
Committee participating and further interaction between external 
and internal attendees during the day

Government and Regulators 

Due to the nature of its business, 
IAG engages with a wide range of 
government and regulatory 
stakeholders. This includes 
members of national parliaments, 
ministers and officials of national 
governments across multiple 
departments (including transport, 
trade, finance, tourism or 
international affairs), MEPs and 
other representatives of the 
institutions of the European Union 
(including at DG MOVE, and other 
relevant directorates as well as 
representatives of individual 
member states in Brussels). This 
wide stakeholder body also 
encompasses civil aviation 
regulators in the countries in which 
our airlines are based and the 
countries of destination. We also 
engage with competition 
authorities, including DG-COMP in 
the EU, the CMA in the UK and, for 
aviation alliances, the Department 
of Transportation in the US.

Key metrics

Why they are important

•  We use quantitative and qualitative 
metrics to monitor and adjust our 
engagement plan. Quantitative metrics 
include the different types of 
engagement, range of policies, and 
seniority of engagement. Qualitative 
appraisal includes assessment of policy 
outcomes and tracking the evolution of 
policy dossiers to ensure that the 
Government Affairs function is targeted 
appropriately

•  We monitor quantitative metrics, which 

for 2023 included:

•  more than 80 contacts held with 
stakeholders in EU Institutions;

•  meetings with more than 70 Members 

of the UK Parliament and Peers;

•  five visits organised for policymakers 
to British Airways and Vueling; and

•  participation in 23 government-to-

government air services negotiations.

•  Government policies and decisions impact 
many aspects of IAG’s business across 
a wide range of areas including transport, 
consumer rights, practical operational issues, 
commercial practices, and the environment. 
We must comply with relevant regulations 
but seek to engage responsibly to influence 
policy developments to benefit our 
customers and achieve our business goals

•  Engagement with policymakers is essential 

to understand plans and encourage 
proportionate outcomes to achieve our 
vision to be a world-leading airline group on 
sustainability and ensure we collectively 
meet our global climate goals

•  Our airlines are subject to regulation by civil 

aviation regulators in the countries of 
registration and those of destination, 
requiring frequent engagement on safety, 
security, consumer rights and a variety 
of other policy and administrative issues 

•  Regular engagement around the world 

is needed to manage market access issues 
under international air services agreements 
and secure the necessary operating permits 

How we engaged

Key topics

•  IAG’s head office Government Affairs team undertakes direct engagement with 

•  Impacts of the war in Ukraine and the Middle 

stakeholders in all the countries in which our airlines are based as well as with EU 
institutions in Brussels. It coordinates the efforts of the Government Affairs teams 
of individual operating companies to ensure consistent and coordinated approaches 

•  We engage directly with policy, market and regulatory stakeholders on questions 

of interest to convey IAG positions and contribute technical expertise to discussions. 
This has included arranging visits to our airlines’ bases to enhance understanding of 
operations and the impacts of policy proposals

East and associated sanctions regimes

•  Sustainability, particularly climate and 
decarbonisation and all aspects of 
environmental policy affecting aviation such 
as availability of and support for investment 
in SAF and noise impacts 

•  Economic impacts of aviation, including 

•  As well as direct contact, we engage through various international, regional, 

tax policy and economic regulation

and local trade associations as well as general business organisations

•  This engagement involves senior executives including the Group Chief Executive, 
Management Committee members, and senior executives from airline operating 
companies where appropriate, mainly in the EU, the UK, Spain and Ireland 

•  IAG aims to provide a factual basis in support of its policy positions and in 2023 
commissioned an extensive study on the Group’s economic impacts from PwC 
and additional research on the benefits of Sustainable Aviation Fuels

•  In the field of international air services, IAG representatives joined diplomatic talks 

wherever possible including those of the EU-US Joint Committee on aviation 
and ICAO’s Air Services Negotiation Event (ICAN) in Saudi Arabia in December 
to support operating companies’ access to market

•  Infrastructure regulation including airspace 
modernisation, the Single European Sky, 
airport charges and slot allocation policy

•  Diversity and inclusion for employment 

as well as development of skills 

•  Consumer rights

•  Safety, security and immigration rules

•  International relations including air service 

agreements and wet leasing, and 
immigration policy

Challenges

Outcomes

•  External factors such as air traffic control 
(ATC) strikes or geopolitical events such 
as the war in Ukraine and the Middle East 
can have relevant impacts on our 
business 

•  Political upheaval presents a challenge 
to consistent policymaking. Changes 
in political leadership through electoral 
cycles are anticipated 

•  With sector recovery post pandemic, 

decarbonisation is a predominant area 
of interest for our stakeholders, requiring 
engagement with regulators on various 
aspects of IAG’s industry position and 
commitments in relation to new 
technology 

•  Consumer rights and customer service 

are of increasing interest to our 
stakeholders, bringing additional interest 
in operational performance from 
stakeholders in the US, EU and UK

•  IAG’s airlines regularly engage in 

discussions with governments and 
aviation authorities in their relevant 
markets to respond to and mitigate 
the risk that states use international air 
service agreements to promote the 
interests of their own airlines, given their 
view that international air services and 
national carriers are strategic interests

•  Sustainability – From both direct meetings and joint efforts with industry and trade 
associations on EU climate-related issues, relevant IAG requests were included in 
the revision and development of different legislation on sustainability, for example:

•  20 million free allowances were allocated for SAF use for 2024-2030 (and could 

be further extended until 2034); and

•  the recognition of price stabilisation mechanisms (contracts for difference) in view 
of the ETS Innovation Fund or the inclusion of aviation as part of the EU Taxonomy.

In the UK, direct engagement and indirect contacts through trade associations were 
instrumental in securing a legal requirement to consult on the form of a price support 
mechanism to encourage investment in SAF plants in the UK. 
Regular IAG opinion surveys of UK Members of Parliament on reputation and policy 
showed increasing support for the use of SAF and other innovations, rather than 
demand management to reach net zero emissions.
Refer to the Sustainability section of this report for more information 

•  Customer service and resilience – The European commitment to sustainability saw 

a focus on improving consumer digital access and travel options. Initiatives such as the 
EU proposal for digital multi-modal services, to provide greater accessibility to other 
modes of transport, were postponed in line with the sector's request not to force 
intermediation that could increase ticket prices for European customers 

Regular engagement with the UK Department for Transport’s Resilience team to 
ensure a proper appreciation of operational disruptions. For example, understanding 
the impacts of bad weather on operations at congested airports 

•  Airport charges – IAG made the case for strong regulation of monopoly providers of 

airport services so that reasonable levels of charges are set. This engagement 
contributed to Spain keeping charges flat in 2023. However, due to combination of 
existing adjustment mechanisms and inflation rates, an increase of 4% is expected for 
2024, lower than that initially proposed by AENA. In the UK, the regulatory authorities 
recognised IAG’s and other airlines’ arguments and confirmed a downward price path 
for Heathrow’s charges for the remainder of the regulatory period to 2026, and denied 
an additional £2 billion that Heathrow airport requested that would have been reflected 
in charges to airlines. Refer to the Regulatory Environment section of the report 

•  Market access – IAG supported operating companies to secure the necessary market 
access through engagement in international negotiations, including British Airways’ 
operating permits for new destinations in the Caribbean or for BA Euroflyer in North 
Africa, as well as enabling new code-share partnerships, including with Indigo in India 

Proposed revision of EU Slot Regulation
The existing EU Slot Regulation system enabled the EU 
to become one of the most connected regions, benefiting 
EU citizens by providing more travel alternatives and allowing 
competing business to develop. It allows airlines to plan 
schedules with predictability, providing the essential stability 
for network airlines to build efficient hubs. It has also allowed 
low-cost carriers to build and grow operations, increasing the 
number of routes that they serve. 

In 2022/2023 the European Commission explored the possibility 
of a revision of the EU Slot Regulation with the objective 
of further enhancing the EU slots system and promoting 
sustainability. One of the aspects under discussion was the 
80% rule: if an airline operates 80% of a slot (landing and take-off 
right) at a given airport in a summer or winter season, it maintains 
the right to operate the slot again the corresponding next season. 
This threshold builds in the flexibility airlines depend on to 
reallocate resources and minimise the impact of unavoidable 
disruption of passengers. This allows the maximum number 
of passengers to get to their destination in a timely manner. 
For example, an airline may take one aircraft from a route where 

there are several daily flights, to replace a grounded aircraft for 
a destination served by only one daily flight. The revision of this 
rule in the EU would limit the flexibility to reallocate resources, 
with a subsequent negative impact for passengers. 

Through engagement, IAG demonstrated that although the 
objective of an airline was to operate to its planned schedule, 
in exceptional situations such as technical problems, adverse 
weather, industrial actions or other unavoidable last-minute 
disruption, cancellations may be necessary. During the 
consultation process opened by the European Commission, 
IAG shared detailed know-how and experience. IAG also 
organised technical meetings between the senior experts of the 
airline operating companies and the relevant decision-makers 
in Brussels and Madrid. IAG also engaged directly with relevant 
stakeholders at EU Institutions and at a national level in Spain and 
Ireland. As it is a technically complex topic, we promoted simpler 
messages through our trade associations to ensure that the 
negative consequences of the revision of the slots regulation for 
passengers could be easily understood by non-aviation experts. 

As a result of the inputs from the airline industry, the EU halted 
its policy plans in this area.

Strengthening 
our financial 
performance

IAG achieved strong operating profits in 
2023, as we continue to transform our 
businesses to deliver world-class 
operating margins and returns on 
invested capital. This result led to strong 
cash generation in the year, strengthening 
our balance sheet, with net leverage back 
within IAG’s target range and improved 
credit ratings, and enabling us to invest in 
improving our customer experience.

Delivering world-class operating margins and returns on 
invested capital
In 2023, the Group benefited from its high-quality and 
increasingly diverse revenue stream, with recovery seen in all 
our businesses and with particular strength in Spain and the 
North and South Atlantic. Passenger capacity operated across 
the year was close to the levels operated in 2019 before the 
COVID-19 pandemic and we were able to generate higher unit 
revenues than in 2019, which offset higher fuel costs and 
supplier cost inflation.

38

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

The result was a strong operating profit before exceptional 
items of €3,507 million compared with €1,247 million in 2022. 
The shape of the recovery differed across our businesses, with 
the strongest recovery in Iberia and Vueling, both of which 
delivered record operating profits, with Aer Lingus and British 
Airways also seeing a significant improvement on the previous 
year.

At a Group level we also repaid a €500 million bond on 
maturity and did not seek refinancing. These actions have 
resulted in a reduction in gross debt of €3,902 million in 2023. 
We retain strong liquidity, with total liquidity at 31 December 
2023 of €11,624 million, including cash of €6,837 million and 
committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities of €4,787 
million. 

Our free cash flow of €1,320 million was after capital 
expenditure of €3,544 million. We continue to invest in our 
strategy and are rebuilding capacity with a more modern, fuel-
efficient fleet. We also invested in our infrastructure, customer 
experience and sustainability. In addition to organic growth, we 
are also pursuing inorganic growth opportunities where they 
offer a good strategic fit. In February 2023, we agreed with 
Globalia the acquisition of the remaining 80% of equity in Air 
Europa, subject to regulatory approval in 2024.

It is pleasing to finish 2023 having achieved the objective we 
set down in these pages in last year’s report: to return the 
Group to historical levels of profit and to continue to 
strengthen the balance sheet. We are aware of the 
uncertainties we face as we enter 2024, including geopolitical 
events outside of our control. We will continue to strengthen 
our balance sheet, transform our businesses and apply 
discipline to how and where we allocate capital, in order to fulfil 
our objective to deliver sustainable shareholder returns.

Nicholas Cadbury
Chief Financial Officer

The recovery has been led by leisure travel across the Group’s 
networks and in all cabins, with the premium leisure segment 
showing particularly strong performance. Corporate travel also 
improved versus the previous year, but at a slower rate than 
anticipated. We continue to grow other revenue streams, 
including IAG Loyalty, which achieved an operating profit of 
£280 million. Our cargo business saw increased volumes in 
2023, but also reduced yields, linked to increases in global 
cargo capacity, the macroeconomic conditions and the reversal 
of the positive impact on yields of supply chain disruption in 
2022. However, its focus on increasing its premium product 
business contributed to delivering yields above 2019 levels. Fuel 
costs remained volatile during the year, with the average fuel 
unit cost similar to 2022, but up over 30% compared with 2019. 
Non-fuel unit costs improved 4.4% compared with the previous 
year, with our ongoing transformation programme partially 
offsetting the impact of inflation; we also made some additional 
investment in the airlines’ operations, IT and the customer 
experience.

Disciplined approach to capital allocation to support 
sustainable growth and margins
The Group’s financial performance and cash generation in 2023 
allowed us to deliver a strengthened balance sheet, with 
positive free cash flow of €1,320 million enabling a reduction in 
leverage, which is now at 1.7 times net debt to EBITDA before 
exceptional items, back within our target maximum of 1.8 times. 
Both S&P and Moody’s increased their credit ratings of the 
Group, with S&P returning IAG to investment grade. British 
Airways’ separate credit ratings were also upgraded, with 
British Airways’ rating now at investment grade with S&P and 
Fitch.

With our strong cash generation, we took the opportunity to 
rebalance our mix of gross debt and cash and in the second 
half of the year we repaid €3,271 million of non-aircraft debt in 
British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus. These loans, 
raised due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, had 
floating interest rates, which had risen significantly over the last 
two years, and hence were amongst the most expensive of the 
Group’s debt; following the early repayment of this debt the 
Group will benefit from a reduced interest expense in future 
years.

In the commentary below, references are made in selected 
places to variances versus 2019 to aid understanding, due to the 
significant reductions in capacity the Group’s airlines made due 
to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the period from 
2020 to 2022. It is anticipated that 2023 will be the last year for 
which analysis versus 2019 is required.

IAG capacity
In 2023, passenger capacity operated, measured in available seat 
kilometres (ASKs), rose by 22.6% versus 2022. For the year, 
capacity operated was 95.7% of 2019 levels and capacity was 
almost fully restored to 2019 levels by the end of the year, 
reaching 98.6% of 2019 levels in the final quarter.

In 2023, British Airways had only restored 90.1% of its total 2019 
capacity, as the substantial majority of the Group’s capacity to 
the Asia Pacific region in 2019, for which recovery following 
COVID-19 has been slower, was operated by British Airways. 
Capacity for British Airways was also impacted by the 
accelerated retirement of its Boeing 747-400 fleet during the 
COVID-19 pandemic and further restoration of capacity is 
planned for British Airways in 2024 and 2025. The reduction in 
LEVEL versus 2019 relates to the discontinuation of operations 
from Paris Orly in 2020, with the capacity of LEVEL’s operation 
in Barcelona up 32.4% versus 2019.

Domestic and Europe
Capacity and passenger numbers in IAG’s Domestic markets, 
which are predominantly within mainland Spain and to the 
Canary and Balearic Islands, increased in line with strong leisure 
demand, with capacity 7.8% higher than 2022, and with a higher 
passenger load factor of 89.5%, which was up 4.0 points versus 
the previous year. Capacity and the passenger load factor were 
also higher than in 2019, up 8.4% and 2.3 points respectively.

The Group’s capacity in Europe was 15.4% higher than in 2022, 
also boosted by the demand for leisure travel. Aer Lingus began 
services to Brindisi, Kos and Olbia. British Airways expanded the 
flying undertaken by its subsidiary launched at London Gatwick 
airport in 2022, BA Euroflyer, with new routes including Corfu, 
Mykonos, Innsbruck, and Fuerteventura. Vueling’s new routes 
include a service from Barcelona to Rovaniemi (Finland) and the 
airline added an extra aircraft at its Bilbao base, with six new 
routes launched. Passenger load factor for the region was up 4.4 
points versus 2022 to 85.9% and was up 2.3 points versus 2019.

North America
The Group’s airlines launched new routes and increased services 
to North America, one of the Group’s core profit pools, with 
capacity 23.0% higher than in 2022 and 3.2% higher than in 2019. 
Aer Lingus started flights to Cleveland and resumed its route to 
Hartford, Connecticut, together with additional frequencies to 
Los Angeles, Seattle, Orlando, and Washington DC. The airline 
will resume its service to Minneapolis and launch a new route to 
Denver in 2024. British Airways launched services from London 
Heathrow to Cincinnati and from London Gatwick to Vancouver, 
a destination already served from its London Heathrow hub. The 
airline plans further increases in 2024, including doubling its 
services to San Diego in the summer. Iberia increased its 
recently-launched routes to Dallas and Washington to year-
round services. LEVEL increased its capacity to North America 
by 23.8% in 2023 and in 2024 will increase further, with a new 
route from Barcelona to Miami and significant capacity increases 
to Boston, Los Angeles and New York, JFK. Passenger load 
factor for the region was up 3.6 points versus 2022 to 82.9% and 
was down 1.2 points versus 2019.

Latin America and Caribbean (LACAR)
IAG’s other core international profit pool is the Latin America 
and Caribbean region, including Iberia’s network of 20 daily 
flights to the region and British Airways flights to the Caribbean. 
British Airways launched flights from London Gatwick to Aruba 
and Guyana. Iberia increased its capacity to primary cities such 
as Bogotá, Lima, Mexico City, Montevideo and Quito. LEVEL 
increased its route to Santiago de Chile to operate as a year-
round service, with LEVEL’s capacity to the region up 45.4% 
versus 2022. IAG’s capacity in LACAR grew 18.8% versus 2022, 
although was still down 1.7% on 2019, linked to the retirement of 
aircraft following the COVID-19 pandemic, with further long-haul 
aircraft due for delivery in 2024. Passenger load factor for the 
region at 87.6% increased 2.5 points versus 2022 and was up 1.2 
points versus 2019.

Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA)
Capacity to this region was up 32.2% on 2022 and up by 1.1% 
versus 2019. BA Euroflyer launched a service from London 
Gatwick to Sharm El Sheikh. British Airways began flights from 
London Gatwick to Accra and the airline will resume flights to 
Abu Dhabi in 2024. Iberia started services to Cairo and launched 
a new route to Doha, which will serve to develop its network 
with partner Qatar Airways. Vueling’s new routes from Barcelona 
included Luxor and Sharm El Sheikh. Passenger load factor for 
the region was up 2.2 points versus 2022 to 83.3% and was up 
0.3 points versus 2019.

Asia Pacific
During 2023, the Asia Pacific continued to be the least 
recovered region from COVID-19, as restrictions linked to the 
pandemic were lifted later than in other markets and industry 
recovery has been slower. British Airways services to Shanghai 
and Beijing resumed in the summer 2023 travel season and 
during the year the airline increased frequencies to Hong Kong 
and Tokyo Haneda. Iberia will re-open its route to Tokyo in 
October 2024. The increases during 2023 led to capacity 258.0% 
higher than 2022 but still 59.7% lower than 2019, with the 
passenger load factor for the region up 4.4 points versus 2022 
to 88.4% and up 2.6 points versus 2019.

Basis of preparation
In its assessment of going concern over the period of at least 12 
months from the date of approval of this report (the ‘going 
concern period’), the Group has prepared extensive modelling, 
including considering a severe but plausible downside scenario. 
Having reviewed these scenarios and sensitivities, and the 
Group’s aircraft financing requirements, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity to 
continue in operational existence over the going concern period, 
and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Summary
The Group was able to substantially restore its capacity 
compared with 2019 and saw recovery in all its businesses, with 
particular strength in Spain and the North and South Atlantic. 
Fuel costs were substantially higher than in 2019 and the Group 
also faced higher supplier cost inflation. The Group was able to 
successfully offset both of these challenges through its high-
quality and increasingly diverse revenue stream, and through 
continued transformation of its businesses. The net result was an 
Operating profit for the year of €3,507 million, versus an Operating 
profit of €1,278 million in 2022. The Profit after tax for the year 
was €2,655 million, versus a profit of €431 million in 2022.

Summary of exceptional items
The Group uses Alternative performance measures (APMs) to 
analyse the underlying results of the business excluding 
exceptional items, which are those that in management’s view 
need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or 
incidence in understanding the entity’s financial performance.

There were no exceptional items in 2023. During 2022, the 
Group recorded exceptional credits relating to the partial 
reversal of a fine issued to British Airways in 2010 and the 
reversal of the impairment of certain aircraft returned to service 
in 2022.

A summary of the exceptional items relating to 2022 is given 
below, with more detail in the Alternative performance measures 
section, including a breakdown of the exceptional items by

The Operating profit before exceptional items for 2023 of 
€3,507 million was €2,260 million better than the Operating 
profit before exceptional items of €1,247 million for 2022, driven 
by the increased capacity and higher revenues, net of higher 
operating costs, as explained further below. The Profit after tax 
and before exceptional items was €2,655 million, €2,253 million 
higher than the 2022 profit of €402 million.

Total revenue increased €6,387 million versus 2022, after 
adverse foreign exchange rate movements of €490 million, 
mainly due to the translation of British Airways’ and IAG 
Loyalty’s results from pound sterling into euro, which resulted in 
an adverse variance of €379 million versus 2022.

Passenger revenue
The increase in Passenger revenue of €6,352 million, or 32.6%, 
was ahead of the increase in passenger capacity of 22.6%, driven 
by higher yields and higher load factors than in 2022. The 
growth in Passenger revenue was linked to the reopening of 
markets, strong leisure demand, together with increases in ticket 
prices to reflect higher fuel prices and supplier price inflation. 
The recovery in corporate travel was slower than that of leisure 
travel, with the Group’s premium leisure segment continuing to 
perform strongly.

The passenger load factor for the year of 85.3% was 3.5 points 
higher than in 2022 and 0.7 points higher than in 2019. 
Passenger yields, measured as passenger revenue per revenue 
passenger kilometre (RPK) were 3.8% higher than in 2022 and 
up 19.0% on 2019. The resulting passenger unit revenue 
(passenger revenue per ASK) for the year was 8.2% higher than 
in 2022 and 20.1% higher than in 2019.

Cargo revenue
Cargo revenue, at €1,156 million, was 28.4% lower than in 2022. 
Cargo volumes, measured in cargo tonne kilometres (CTKs), 
were 17.2% higher than the previous year, as the Group’s airlines 
further restored their operations, leading to an increase in both 
passenger and cargo capacity. Cargo yields, measured as cargo 
revenue per cargo tonne kilometre, were 38.9% lower than in 
2022, reflecting the substantial growth in global cargo capacity 
across the industry, together with softer market demand, 
reflecting the macro-economic conditions. In 2022, cargo yields 
had benefited from disruption to global supply chains, and 
disruption to shipping, particularly in the first half of the year. 
Cargo yields benefited from a growth in premium products, 
enabled by the opening of a new premium cargo facility at 
London Heathrow. At Madrid, IAG Cargo’s investment in a 
perishable goods handling facility was completed, further 
boosting cargo handling capacity. 

Cargo revenue increased by €39 million, or 3.5% versus 2019. 
The increase was primarily driven by a 23.8% increase in cargo 
yields compared with 2019, which included the impact of 
transformation initiatives. The higher cargo yields more than 
compensated for a decline in volumes, which were 16.4% lower 
than in 2019, mainly due to weaker market demand and reduced 
cargo capacity, particularly from the Asia Pacific region.

7,557  

1,437 

 23.5  %

Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges were up €1,437 million 
versus 2022, principally reflecting increased flying volumes. In 
2022, the impact of the significant increase in commodity fuel 
prices, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of 
that year, was mitigated by the Group’s fuel hedging 
programme. In 2023, whilst average spot fuel prices linked to 
fuel purchase contracts were 17% lower than in 2022, the impact 
of hedging was neutral, with the result that the Group’s effective 
fuel price after hedging was similar to the previous year. Foreign 
exchange movements accounted for only €6 million of the 
increase, with the impact of a weaker US dollar against the euro 
and pound sterling offset by translation exchange between the 
pound sterling and euro. Within Fuel, oil costs and emissions 
charges, the cost of complying with emissions trading schemes 
was €238 million, up from €134 million in 2022, reflecting both 
the higher level of capacity flown, market prices under such 
schemes, and the reduction in free allowances issued across the 
EU and UK.

On a unit basis per ASK, Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges 
were up 0.7% versus 2022.

Other revenue
One of the Group’s strategic imperatives is to drive earnings 
growth through asset-light businesses, with the growth of IAG 
Loyalty a particular priority. The impact of the growth in IAG 
Loyalty contributes both to the airlines’ Passenger revenue and 
to Other revenue, through both the issuance and redemption of 
its loyalty currency, Avios. IAG Loyalty delivered another strong 
year of growth in the number of members collecting Avios, 
including through its partnership with American Express. IAG 
Loyalty’s Other revenue was up 61% versus 2022 to €524 million.

The largest Other revenue streams for the Group are BA 
Holidays and Iberia’s maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) 
business. BA Holidays grew revenues in line with the continued 
increase in flying activity and holiday and hotel services revenue 
increasing by €133 million to €938 million. Iberia’s MRO business 
saw increased engine maintenance activity for third-party 
airlines, with revenues from maintenance and overhaul services 
up €155 million to €683 million. Revenue from ground handling, 
at €195 million, was flat versus 2022. After a competitive tender 
process for ground handling contracts, the final resolution in 
September 2023 resulted in the loss of third-party handling 
contracts at eight airports for Iberia and as a result Iberia will see 
a reduction in ground handling activity and revenues in 2024.

Overall for the year, Other revenue was up 24.8% versus 2022 to 
€2,487 million, 29.5% higher than in 2019.

Operating costs
Total operating expenditure rose from €21,788 million in 2022 to 
€25,946 million in 2023, linked to the higher volume of flights 
and passenger numbers and after favourable foreign currency 
movements of €408 million, of which €351 million were due to 
the translation of the operating costs of British Airways and IAG 
Loyalty from pound sterling into euros.

The rise in Employee costs of €776 million or 16.7% versus 2022

the related increase in employee numbers, as well as the 
investment in British Airways’ London hub to improve 
operational performance. Average headcount for the year was 
69,762, up 9,962 or 16.7% versus 2022. The Group agreed pay 
deals with the substantial majority of its bargaining groups and 
employees during 2023.

Financial review continued

Fuel hedging
The Group seeks to reduce the impact of volatile commodity 
prices by hedging prices in advance. The Group’s current fuel 
hedging policy was approved by the Board in May 2021 (and has 
been regularly reviewed for appropriateness by the Audit and 
Compliance Committee subsequently) and is designed to 
provide flexibility to respond to both significant unexpected 
reductions in travel demand or capacity and/or material or 
sudden changes in jet fuel prices. The policy allows for 
differentiation within the Group, to match the nature of each 
operating company, and the use of call options for a proportion 
of the hedging undertaken. The policy operates on a two-year 
rolling basis, with hedging of up to 60% of anticipated 
requirements in the first 12 months and up to 30% in the 
following 12 months, and with flexibility for low-cost airlines 
within the Group to adopt hedging up to 75% in the first 12 
months. For all Group airlines, hedging between 25 and 36 
months ahead is only undertaken in exceptional circumstances.

Fuel consumption
The Group continued to benefit from reduced fuel consumption, 
associated with the investment in new fleet, with 35 newer-
generation and more fuel-efficient aircraft entering service in the 
year. Increased passenger load factors versus 2022 also 
contributed to reduced carbon intensity, measured as grammes of 
CO2 per passenger kilometre, which was down 3.6% versus 2022.

partial reversal of the historical fine, plus accrued interest, initially issued 
by the European Commission to British Airways for involvement in cartel 
activity and recognised as an exceptional charge in 2010. Further 
information is given in the Alternative performance measures section.

Total Supplier costs rose by €1,932 million, or 21.5% to €10,905 
million, slightly below the increase in capacity. Supplier costs 
were impacted by continued high levels of inflation and 
disruption costs, although the impact was partially mitigated by 
the Group’s procurement and transformation initiatives.

Supplier costs include a €26 million currency differences charge 
in 2023 versus a €141 million currency differences charge in the 
previous year; 2022 had been impacted by a significant 
strengthening of the US dollar against both the pound sterling 
and the euro versus 2021. Total foreign currency impacts on 
Supplier costs, including currency differences, were €298 million 
favourable versus 2022, including a favourable impact of €163 
million related to translating British Airways’ and IAG Loyalty’s 
supplier costs from pound sterling into euro and the €141 million 
favourable currency differences charge outlined above.

On a unit basis per ASK, Supplier costs were down 1.1% versus 2022.

Ownership costs
Ownership costs include Depreciation, amortisation and 
impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including right of

Alternative performance measures section.

The increase in ownership costs versus 2022 is mainly driven by 
the increase in the Group’s fleet of aircraft, linked to the restoration 
of capacity and 34 deliveries of new aircraft in the year. The Net 
gain on sale of property, plant and equipment was €2 million, 
reflecting the disposal of aircraft withdrawn from service and 
related spare parts. On a unit basis per ASK, Ownership costs were 
down 18.2% versus 2022, mainly reflecting the restoration of 
capacity and improvements in aircraft utilisation.

Aircraft fleet
In 2023, the in-service fleet increased by 24 aircraft: 37 aircraft 
entered service and 13 aircraft were retired. Of the aircraft 
entering service, five re-entered service having previously been 
stood down and two were delivered in late 2022. In total, 34 
aircraft were delivered in the year, of which four aircraft entered 
service early in 2024.

In addition to the in-service fleet, there were a further nine 
aircraft not in service, made up of five aircraft held by the Group 
pending disposal or lease return and four aircraft delivered late 
in 2023 and not in service by 31 December 2023.

Exchange rate impact
Exchange rate impacts are calculated by retranslating current 
year results at prior year exchange rates. The reported revenues 
and expenditures are impacted by the translation of currencies 
other than euro to the Group’s reporting currency of euro, 
primarily pound sterling related to British Airways and IAG 
Loyalty. From a transaction perspective, the Group’s 
performance is impacted by the fluctuation of exchange rates, 
primarily exposure to the pound sterling, euro and US dollar. The 
Group typically generates a surplus in most currencies in which it 
does business, except the US dollar, for which capital 
expenditure, debt repayments and fuel purchases typically 
create a deficit which is managed and partially hedged. The 
Group hedges its economic exposure from transacting in foreign 
currencies but does not hedge the translation impact of 
reporting in euro.

Overall, in 2023 the Group operating profit before exceptional 
items was reduced by €82 million due to adverse exchange rate 
impacts.

quarter by 16.3% or €48 million, linked to the early debt 
repayments described in ‘Early repayment of debt raised in 2020 
and 2021’ below and in note 3 to the Group financial statements. 
Finance income was up €334 million, reflecting the Group’s 
strong cash balances and the higher interest rates earned on 
deposits. The other main movement was for net currency 
retranslation, with a credit of €176 million in 2023 versus a 
charge of €115 million in 2022, principally reflecting the 
weakening of the US dollar.

The Net change in the fair value of financial instruments of €11 
million reflects fair value adjustments at 31 December 2023 of 
IAG’s €825 million convertible bond maturing in 2028.

Other non-operating credits of €8 million in 2023 (2022: credit 
of €110 million) mainly represent net gains or losses on derivative 
contracts for which hedge accounting is not applied, together 
with a net gain of €10 million in 2023 on the sale of investments.

Tax
The tax charge on the Profit for the year was €401 million (2022: 
tax credit of €16 million), and the effective tax rate was 13.1% 
(2022: negative 3.9%). 

The substantial majority of the Group’s activities are taxed where 
the main operations are based: in the UK, Spain and Ireland, 
which had statutory corporation tax rates of 23.5%, 25.0% and 
12.5% respectively for 2023. The expected effective tax rate for 
the Group is determined by applying the relevant corporation 
tax rate to the profits or losses of each jurisdiction.

The geographical distribution of profits and losses in the Group 
results in the expected tax rate being 23.5% for the year to 31 
December 2023. The difference between the actual effective tax 
rate of 13.1% and the expected tax rate of 23.5% is primarily due 
to the recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses in the 
Group’s Spanish companies.

The Profit after tax for the year was €2,655 million (2022: 
€431 million).

On 3 March 2021, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer 
announced that legislation would be introduced in the Finance 
Bill 2021 to set the main rate of corporation tax at 25% from April 
2023. On 24 May 2021, the Finance Bill was substantively 
enacted, which has led to the remeasurement of deferred tax 
balances and will increase the Group’s future current tax charge 
accordingly. As a result of the remeasurement of deferred tax 
balances in UK entities, a charge of €13 million (2022: €17 million 
credit) is recorded in the Income statement and a credit of €3 
million (2022: €10 million charge) is recorded in Other 
comprehensive income.

The Group is monitoring the OECD’s proposed two-pillar 
solution to address the tax challenges arising from the 
digitalisation of the economy. This reform to the international tax 
system is designed to ensure that multinational enterprises with 
consolidated worldwide annual turnover exceeding €750 million 
will be subject to a minimum 15% effective tax rate, and also 
proposes to address the geographical allocation of profits for 
the purposes of taxation. On 15 December 2022, the Council of 
the European Union formally adopted the EU Pillar Two 
Directive. On 22 December 2022, the EU Minimum Tax Directive 
was published.

On 11 July 2023, the UK enacted Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 which 
introduced the Multinational Top-up Tax and the Domestic Top-
up Tax with effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 
31 December 2023. These taxes are the UK’s adoption of the 
income inclusion rule and domestic minimum top-up tax rule 
referenced in the OECD’s Pillar Two reform.

On 18 December 2023, Ireland enacted Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 
which, pursuant to the EU Minimum Tax Directive, provided for 
the introduction of a new minimum effective rate of tax for 
certain businesses. These rules provide for a Qualified Domestic 
Top-Up Tax where an in-scope group’s Irish operations have an 
effective rate of tax of less than 15%. They come into force for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023. 

On 19 December 2023, Spain’s Council of Ministers approved a 
draft law to implement the EU Minimum Tax Directive. This is to 
be subject to consultation, prior to being sent to Parliament.

For 2023, the predominant jurisdiction in which the Group 
operates with an effective tax rate of less than 15% is Ireland 
through Aer Lingus. While the impact on the Group of the 
adoption of Pillar Two is not yet reasonably possible to estimate, 
for indicative purposes, in 2023 Aer Lingus recorded a current 
tax expense of €24 million relating to its Irish operations, 
representing an effective tax rate of 12.8%. Had the effective tax 
rate applied by Aer Lingus to its Irish operations been 15%, the 
current period tax expense would have increased by €4 million 
to €28 million, which would have increased the overall Group 
effective tax rate from 13.1% to 13.3%.

On 18 January 2024, the Tribunal Constitucional (Constitutional 
Court) in Spain issued a ruling that the amendments to 
corporate income tax arising from the introduction of Royal 
Decree-Law 3/2016 were unconstitutional and accordingly 
revoked. The Group has not adjusted the financial statements for 
this revocation, but expects to recognise a tax receivable, 
excluding interest arising, from the Spanish tax authorities of 
approximately €191 million and an associated deferred tax 
charge of approximately €58 million.

Financial review continued

Review by operating company
All of the airline operating companies saw a significant increase 
in profitability in 2023, with Iberia and Vueling achieving record 
levels of operating profit, reflecting strong passenger yields, 
which were able to offset the impacts of higher effective fuel 
prices and inflation.

British Airways operated the lowest passenger capacity relative 
to 2019, with ASKs at 90.1% of 2019, partly linked to the delayed 
restoration of its capacity to the Asia Pacific region, which saw 
COVID-19 restrictions continue longer than the rest of IAG’s 
markets. Aer Lingus operated at 104.4% of 2019 capacity, 
including the impact of its new UK base at Manchester Airport 
opened in October 2021. Iberia and Vueling both increased 
capacity versus 2019, operating at 103.2% and 108.5% of 2019 
levels respectively.

1 The 2019 and 2022 results include a reclassification to conform with the 
current year presentation for the Net gain on sale of property, plant and 
equipment within Operating profit.

2 The 2019 results have been restated for the treatment of administration 
costs associated with the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes. 

IAG Loyalty showed significant growth in its non-airline partner 
revenue streams, together with benefiting from the recovery in 
the Group’s airlines, leading to a second successive year of 
record operating profits, with operating profit before 
exceptional items of £280 million (€321 million), up from £240 
million (€282 million) in 2022. IAG Loyalty’s operating margin for 
2023 was 21.7%, with the reduction of 6.7 points from 28.4% in 
2022 due to the increased level of Avios redemption activity as 
well as the mix of Avios issued between the Group’s airlines and 
other partners.

Capital expenditure
In 2023, the Group continued to invest in its aircraft fleets, 
customer products and services, IT infrastructure and 
sustainability, as the business continued to recover and restore 
capacity. Capital expenditure, measured as the Acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from the 
Cash flow statement, was €3,544 million, compared with €3,875 
million in 2022, with the reduction of €331 million due to the 
profile of fleet deliveries and pre-delivery payments, with 
investment in IT higher than in 2022, as the Group continues to 
invest in its IT estate and transformation projects. In 2023, the 
Group took delivery of 34 aircraft: ten for British Airways, 14 for 
Iberia, six for Vueling, two for Aer Lingus and two for LEVEL. Of 
these deliveries, 28 were aircraft acquired from Airbus and 
Boeing and six were leased directly from aircraft lessors (2022: 
25 aircraft acquired from Airbus and Boeing and two leased 
directly from aircraft lessors). One of the aircraft acquired from 
Airbus in 2023 was novated to a lessor immediately prior to the 
point of delivery as part of a sale and leaseback arrangement, 
which resulted in the final delivery payment for the aircraft being 
made by the lessor, rather than by the Group as capital 
expenditure; the Group also received a refund of the pre-delivery 
payments it had made in advance of the delivery date in respect 
of that aircraft.

Working capital
The net movement in working capital saw a cash outflow of €142 
million in 2023, compared with a significant cash inflow of €1,884 
million in 2022. The year 2022 had seen a significant restoration 
of airline capacity by the end of the year, with significant related 
increases in bookings for future travel (Deferred revenue), net of 
trade receivables, together with an increase in Trade and other 
payables, linked to the increase in the Group’s flying 
programmes and the related increase in operating expenditure. 
By contrast, in 2023, working capital had returned closer to a 
steady-state position. Inventories increased by €141 million to 
€494 million, partially linked to engine purchases to meet 
maintenance requirements. Trade receivables were up by €229 
million to €1,559 million, related to higher passenger numbers 
and yields, together with some timing differences related to 
certain receipts due from the Spanish government. 

At 31 December 2023, total Deferred revenue, which includes the 
Group’s loyalty schemes, was €8,023 million, an increase of €379 
million versus €7,644 million at 31 December 2022. Deferred 
revenue at 31 December 2023 includes €645 million in respect of 
unredeemed vouchers, including associated taxes (2022: €911 
million). The unredeemed voucher balance includes: flight 
vouchers issued to customers at their election to provide the 
flexibility to change their destination and/or date of travel (a 
policy introduced in 2020 and still in operation) and loyalty-
related companion vouchers (referred to as ‘non-disrupted 
vouchers’); vouchers issued due to COVID-19 flight cancellations 
(referred to as ‘disrupted vouchers’); certain other flexible fare 
options; and other gift vouchers. The outstanding balance of 
disrupted vouchers at 31 December 2023 was €139 million, with 
the remaining €506 million relating to ongoing commercial 
policies, which the Group expects to continue to be offered in 
the future.

Aircraft orders
During 2023, the Group converted ten A320neo options to firm 
deliveries in 2028, as replacement aircraft for its short-haul 
network. A new order was placed for British Airways for six 
Boeing 787-10 aircraft, and one new Airbus A350-900 aircraft 
was ordered for Iberia; the aircraft represented by these new 
orders will be delivered in 2025 and 2026. In addition to these 
orders from Airbus and Boeing, the Group entered into leases 
directly with lessors for two Airbus A350-900 aircraft for Iberia, 
two Airbus A330-200 aircraft for LEVEL and two A320ceo 
aircraft for Vueling, all of which were delivered during the year. 
The table below includes three further A320ceo aircraft for 
Vueling, for which leases were signed prior to 31 December 
2023, with the aircraft to be delivered in 2024. 

The Group anticipates introducing eight further A320ceo aircraft 
for Vueling in 2024 through operating leases, to cover aircraft 
availability linked to additional maintenance requirements for 
aircraft with Pratt & Whitney ‘GTF’ engines.

In addition to those committed future deliveries shown above, at 
31 December 2023, the Group held options to acquire a further 
235 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing.

Capital commitments
Capital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 31 
December 2023 amounted to €12,706 million (2022: €13,749 
million), with the decrease attributable to the net of the aircraft 
deliveries and the new orders described above. Most of these 
commitments are denominated in US dollars.

The Group has certain rights to cancel commitments in the event 
of significant delays to aircraft deliveries caused by the aircraft 
manufacturers. No such rights had been exercised as at 31 
December 2023.

Financial review continued

Funding and debt
IAG’s long-term objectives when managing capital are: to 
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and 
its long-term viability; to maintain an optimal capital structure in 
order to reduce the cost of capital; and to provide sustainable 
returns to shareholders. In November 2018, S&P and Moody’s 
assigned IAG long-term investment-grade credit ratings with a 
stable outlook; IAG’s credit ratings remained investment-grade 
up until the outbreak of COVID-19. In 2023, due to the 
improvement in the Group’s profitability, cash generation and 
balance sheet, both S&P and Moody’s raised their credit ratings 
of IAG in the fourth quarter of the year. The Group’s current 
ratings (at 28 February 2024) are: S&P: BBB- (investment 
grade), Moody’s: Ba1. British Airways has separate credit ratings, 
which were also increased to BBB- (investment grade) by Fitch 
and S&P; Moody’s rating of British Airways is Ba1.

Debt and capital
The Group monitors leverage using net debt to EBITDA before 
exceptional items, in addition to closely following measures used 
by the credit ratings agencies, including those based on total 
borrowings (gross debt).

In 2019, the Group set a target of net debt to EBITDA before 
exceptional items below 1.8 times, which broadly corresponded 
to investment grade with the credit ratings agencies. At its 
Capital Markets Day in November 2023, the Group confirmed 
this target remains appropriate.

As at 31 December 2023, net debt to EBITDA before exceptional 
items had reduced to 1.7 times, compared with 3.1 times in 2022, 
reflecting the strong recovery in profitability and the related 
cash generation, with capital expenditure €331 million lower than 
the previous year.

Early repayment of debt raised in 2020 and 2021
During 2020 and 2021, the Group’s airlines required additional 
liquidity, due to the significant adverse impact of COVID-19, and 
all entered into special COVID-19-related financing 
arrangements, partially or fully guaranteed by the governments 
in their home countries. This debt was based on floating rate 
arrangements and agreed at margins that reflected the condition 
of the financial markets and the Group’s airlines at the time; this 
debt was among the most expensive of the Group’s debt to 
service. As a result of the Group’s profitability and cash 
generation in 2022 and 2023, and expected continued strong 
cash generation over the foreseeable future, in the second half 
of 2023, the Board agreed that the remainder of this debt should 
be repaid ahead of its scheduled maturity, which was between 
2024 and 2026. The total amount repaid early was €3,271 million: 
£2,000 million (€2,312 million) for British Airways, partially 
guaranteed by the UK Export Fund (UKEF); €644 million and 
€223 million for Iberia and Vueling respectively, partially 
guaranteed by Spain’s Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO); €42 
million of other non-aircraft debt for Iberia; and €50 million to 
the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) for Aer Lingus. 
These early debt repayments will result in a reduction in interest 
costs in future years. 

Following these early repayments, and the repayment of IAG’s 
€500 million bond in July 2023, the maturity profile of the 
Group’s debt as of 31 December 2023, aside from aircraft 
financing payments, includes two €500 million IAG bonds due in 
2025 and 2027, respectively, IAG’s €825 million 2028 convertible 
bond and a €700 million IAG bond due in 2029.

Net debt at 31 December

  9,245    10,385    (1,140) 

Net debt reduced by €1,140 million, principally due to the 
recovery in profitability and operating cash flow generation, 
partially offset by the capital expenditure of €3,544 million. 
Gross debt reduced by €3,902 million during the year to €16,082 
million. Repayments exceeded new borrowings by €4,998 
million, mainly due to the early repayments of non-aircraft debt 
outlined above, the repayment on maturity of a €500 million IAG 
bond, and scheduled repayments of aircraft financing exceeding 
new aircraft financing raised during the year. The Group also 
raised financing by way of sale and leaseback transactions and 
extended existing leases, which together added €1,315 million to 
gross debt. The Group’s gross debt is subject to foreign 
exchange translation movements, as the majority of the Group’s 
aircraft debt is denominated in US dollars. Over the course of 
2023, the euro and pound sterling strengthened against the US 
dollar leading to a decrease in gross debt of €361 million. The 
remainder of the variance in gross debt versus 2022 is mainly 
due to the increase in the fair value of IAG’s €825 million 
convertible bond due in 2028.

British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and IAG Loyalty all 
experienced significant positive operating cash flow in the year. 
The reduction in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and 
interest-bearing deposits in IAG and other Group companies 
principally reflects the early repayment of floating rate 
unsecured debt in all the airlines, and the repayment of the IAG 
€500 million 2023 bond on maturity.

Long-term aircraft financing was drawn for 31 aircraft during 2023, 
including five aircraft that were delivered in 2022 to British 
Airways and for which funding was committed at 31 December 
2022. The Group also secured committed funding of €375 million, 
to be drawn in 2024, for three British Airways aircraft, including 
two delivered in 2023; this committed funding is included in 
committed and undrawn aircraft financing facilities at 31 December 
2023. Linked to its strong cash generation, Iberia did not seek 
financing for three new A321neo aircraft delivered in 2023, with 
these aircraft held unencumbered at 31 December 2023.

Equity
No equity was raised or repaid during the year, nor in 2022.

Liquidity facilities
During the year, the Group exercised a one-year extension to the 
availability of its Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), which now has 
committed availability until March 2026. The available amount 
will remain at $1,755 million (€1,605 million) until March 2025 and 
reduce to $1,655 million (€1,513 million) for the final 12 months to 
March 2026. The facility was originally agreed and executed with 
a syndicate of banks in 2021, with availability for three years, plus 
two consecutive one-year extension periods, at the discretion of 
the lenders. The facility is available to Aer Lingus, British Airways 
and Iberia, each of which has a separate borrower limit within 
the overall facility. Any drawings under the facility would be 
secured against eligible unencumbered aircraft assets and/or 
take-off and landing rights at London Heathrow or London 
Gatwick airports. This facility was undrawn at 31 December 2023. 

The Group also added a new £1,000 million (€1,159 million) 
committed credit facility for British Airways, partially guaranteed 
by the UKEF, which was agreed upon the repayment of British 
Airways’ £2,000 million (€2,312 million) loan in September 2023 
and which matures in September 2028. This is in addition to the 
existing £1,000 million (€1,159 million) committed credit facility 
for British Airways, partially guaranteed by the UKEF, which was 
agreed and executed in 2021 and matures in November 2026. 
Both facilities were undrawn at 31 December 2023.

Aer Lingus has a €350 million credit facility with Ireland’s ISIF, 
which is available until March 2025. This facility was undrawn at 
31 December 2023. At 31 December 2022 €50 million was drawn; 
this €50 million was repaid in the first half of 2023. 

The Group also has certain other committed and undrawn 
general and overdraft facilities, bringing total committed and 
undrawn general and overdraft facilities at 31 December 2023 to 
€4,412 million (2022: €3,284 million).

The Group also holds €375 million of committed and undrawn 
aircraft financing facilities (2022: €1,116 million). The committed 
amount at 31 December 2023 represents financing for three 
British Airways aircraft to be drawn in 2024. The committed and 
undrawn aircraft financing facilities at 31 December 2022 
included committed financing for five aircraft for British Airways 
that was drawn in 2023 and certain backstop financing 
arrangements, which have now expired. The Group’s aircraft 
deliveries continue to be successfully financed on regular long-
term financing arrangements as required, and hence no drawing 
on these backstop arrangements was necessary.

In total, the Group had €4,787 million of committed and 
undrawn general and aircraft facilities as at 31 December 2023 
(2022: €4,400 million).

The facilities values above do not include the balance of certain 
shorter-term working capital facilities available to the Group’s 
operating companies.

Dividends
No dividends were proposed or paid in 2023 (2022: nil).

Liquidity and cash flow
Total liquidity, measured as cash, cash equivalents and interest-
bearing deposits of €6,837 million and committed and undrawn 
general and aircraft facilities of €4,787 million, was €11,624 million 
at 31 December 2023. This represented a decrease of €2,375 
million versus total liquidity of €13,999 million at the end of 2022, 
linked mainly to the Group’s decision to repay certain of its debt 
raised in 2020 and 2021 in advance of its scheduled maturity.

Cash flow
The Group saw strong cash flow generation in 2023, mainly 
linked to its strong profit performance; the strong cash 
generation in turn allowed the Group to rebalance the mix of 
gross debt and cash by undertaking the early debt repayments 
outlined above. 

Free cash flow
In 2023, the Group adopted Free cash flow as an Alternative 
performance measure, replacing Levered free cash flow. Free 
cash flow is defined as Net cash flows from operating activities 
less Acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets. See Alternative performance measures section for further 
details.

In December 2022, British Airways agreed the valuation of its 
main defined benefit pension scheme, the New Airways Pension 
Scheme (NAPS), with the scheme’s Trustee, which resulted in a 
deficit as at the valuation date of 31 March 2021 of £1,650 million 
(€1,887 million). As at 31 December 2023, the scheme was over 
100% funded on the 2021 valuation basis and an overfunding 
protection mechanism agreed with the NAPS Trustee had the 
effect that no contributions were due in 2022 or 2023. Deficit 
contributions could resume should the funding level fall in the 
future. The pension cash flows shown above represent payments 
to various smaller schemes within the Group. The valuation of 
the main British Airways pension schemes also showed a surplus 
on the IAS 19 accounting basis, which does not impact 
contributions due to the schemes. Total Employee benefit assets 
at 31 December 2023, of which the principal element is the NAPS 
accounting surplus, were €1,380 million; the reduction of €954 
million versus 31 December 2022 was predominately due to the 
impact of the fall in AA corporate bond yields applied in 
discounting scheme liabilities, leading to higher liabilities at the 
same time as the market value of assets fell, mainly due to the 
increase in UK government bond yields.

In 2023, Free cash flow was €1,320 million, up €341 million versus 
2022, driven by similar Net cash flows from operating activities, 
but lower capital expenditure, as outlined above. In 2022, whilst 
the Operating profit was significantly lower, Net cash flows from 
operating activities benefited from the restoration of capacity 
and the associated positive impact on working capital, mainly 
from the rebuilding of advanced ticket sales.

Proceeds from borrowings reflect the cash inflows from aircraft 
financing as described in the Funding and debt section above. 
Aside from the additional liquidity facilities described in 
‘Liquidity facilities’ above, there was no new non-aircraft 
financing raised in 2023 (2022: nil).

Settlement of derivative financial instruments relates to 
settlements of foreign exchange instruments taken out to hedge 
long-term debt payments, including US dollar lease payments. 
The outflow in 2023 relates to the weakening of the US dollar 
versus the euro and pound sterling. In 2022, the significant 
inflow related to the strengthening of the US dollar versus the 
euro and pound sterling. 

The Acquisition of treasury shares and other financing 
movements includes the purchase of 27 million shares in 2023 
related to the Group’s intended acquisition of the remaining 
shares in Air Europa Holdings, as part of the consideration is 
required to be delivered as IAG shares, together with 15 million 
shares related to employee incentive schemes. In 2022, 15 million 
shares were purchased related to employee incentive schemes.

Provision and other non-cash movements mainly relate to 
restoration and handback provisions for leased aircraft and ETS 
allowances. Provisions for ETS allowances are charged to Fuel, 
oil costs and emissions charges as they are built up through the 
year, with the cash payment for ETS credits acquired by the 
Group’s airlines to meet the requirements of the various 
emissions trading schemes accounted for as capital expenditure. 
Provision and other non-cash movements also include 
restructuring payments of €82 million, mainly relating to 
redundancy programmes in Iberia agreed prior to 2020.

The increase in interest paid in 2023 reflects higher interest 
rates, partially mitigated in the fourth quarter by the early 
repayment of €3,271 million of floating rate debt outlined above. 
After including the impact of hedging, 13% of the Group’s total 
debt at 31 December 2023 was on floating rate arrangements.

The €1,091 million of cash inflow from the Sale of property, plant 
and equipment, intangible assets and investments is mainly due 
to the aircraft sale and leaseback transactions discussed in the 
Funding and debt section above, together with the disposal of 
assets, principally aircraft being retired from service. The 
increase from 2022 reflects the number and type of aircraft 
financed through sale and leaseback transactions in 2023 
compared with 2022.

In March 2022, IAG entered into a convertible loan with Globalia 
for €100 million, convertible into an equity stake in Air Europa 
Holdings of 20%; the conversion option was exercised in August 
2022, with the equity stake treated as an equity investment.

Regulatory environment

Engagement for the 
benefit of our industry

Engagement context
The strong recovery in demand for 
travel during 2023 was accompanied by 
the usual close scrutiny by regulators 
and policy-makers with additional 
challenges created by the geopolitical 
background. Political dynamics in Spain 
and forthcoming elections in the UK and 
for the European Parliament mean that 
policymakers have tended to focus on 
shorter-term priorities which is a 
challenge for an industry with long 
investment cycles. 

With this overall context, IAG continued 
to engage with policymakers in the 
institutions of the European Union and in 
the countries in which its operating 
airlines are based or serve, to promote 
the economic and social benefits of 
aviation and explain the impacts of 
policy proposals on our business. We 
continue to encourage aviation 
regulators to adopt measured policies 
that recognise the competitive nature 
of international aviation (including 
proposals to amend airport slot 
allocation rules in the EU or the UK) 
and to promote a greater balance of 
the risk and reward in the regulation 
of monopoly airports and Air Navigation 
Service Providers (ANSPs), given 
the significant cost to airlines of 
their services. 

In addition to direct engagement 
with policymakers, IAG worked through 
trade associations, notably Airlines 
4 Europe (A4E) and the International 
Air Transport Association (IATA), as 
well as national industry and business 
associations, to put its case to 
governments and institutions such 
as the International Civil Aviation 
Organisation (ICAO) on issues of 
importance to the Group and its 
customers, especially in sustainability.

Geopolitical instability 
The far-reaching impacts of the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine in 2022 on the world 
also had immediate practical effects on 
airlines by preventing European and UK 
airlines from operating through Russian 
airspace, a situation which, along with 
the war, endured throughout 2023. IAG’s 
operating companies adapted by 
routing aircraft to and from Asia away 
from Russian airspace with the resultant 
increase in flying time driving more 
complex planning and a need for 
additional crew. 

At various times in 2023, military coups 
and other conflicts in West Africa and 
the Sahel region resulted in further 
temporary restrictions to airspace. 
Although the risks to smooth operations 
from such events can usually be 
managed and are isolated in their 
geographical impact, they also 
exacerbate industry-wide challenges. 

A further impact of the war in Ukraine 
was seen in 2023 with the extension of 
sanctions on Russia by the EU and the 
UK to prohibit, from the end of 
September, the import of Russian iron 
and steel products processed in a third 
country. The additional requirements to 
scrutinise the origins of steel and the 
location of manufacture have slowed 
procurement of aircraft parts adding 
to pressure on the global supply chain.

“IAG continues to play a 
leading role in developing 
industry plans for 
reaching net zero carbon 
emissions.”

The conflict in Israel from 7 October 
and the subsequent escalation of 
military action in Israel and Gaza meant 
that IAG’s airlines ceased operations to 
Israel. There are immediate commercial 
impacts of being unable to operate to 
the country and further signs of impact 
on markets in the immediate conflict 
area. We continue to monitor the wider 
economic impacts on the world 
economy of this and other conflicts.

The global supply chain has not yet 
returned to normal from the disruption 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
having the practical effect of putting 
pressure on maintenance and 
engineering resources affecting fleet 
availability. Both Airbus and Boeing have 
seen delivery schedules for new aircraft 
slip behind their original plan and the 
distribution of replacement parts 
continues to take longer than it did in 
2019, increasing maintenance times for 
many airlines. The problems that 
emerged during the year for airlines 
operating Airbus aircraft with the Pratt 
& Whitney PW1100G ‘GTF’ engines 
meant significant additional numbers 
of aircraft in the global airline fleet 
required additional maintenance at the 
end of 2023. While the impacts for IAG’s 
own aircraft are limited and manageable, 
the pressure on maintenance facilities 
increased during 2023 since other 
airlines took up capacity to solve this 
issue and will continue to do so in the 
coming years. IAG engaged with 
regulators to explain the potential 
difficulties for customers that this 
pressure could cause.

Sustainability 
Much of IAG’s advocacy and 
engagement in 2023 was concerned 
with the issue of sustainability. IAG 
continues to play a leading role in 
developing industry plans for reaching 
net zero carbon emissions and the 
Group’s strategic approach and practical 
actions to reaching our targets 
are explained in detail in the 
Sustainability section.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

In the UK, IAG engaged with cabinet 
ministers and officials at all levels 
to encourage support for a UK SAF 
industry that can provide thousands 
of new jobs and see plants built in the 
regions of the UK. IAG advocates the 
use of free allowances from future 
revenues that airlines will pay into the 
UK ETS (mirroring the EU approach), 
to support the purchase of advanced 
SAF and encourage SAF production 
as seen in the US and Europe. We look 
forward to providing input to the 
UK’s consultation on a price support 
mechanism for SAF production 
which is an essential requirement 
to securing investment. 

Aviation policy issues 
Potential changes considered by the 
EU and the UK to the global system 
used to allocate takeoff and landing 
slots at congested airports were 
an important focus of government 
engagement throughout 2023. 

IAG supports the use of the Worldwide 
Airport Slots Guidelines (WASG) system, 
formulated by IATA, since it provides 
a stable, internationally accepted system 
(reflected in the relevant EU Slot 
Regulation and UK laws) that 
encourages competition but also 
supports reliable, established networks. 

In 2023, the EU considered but halted 
changes to this system and the UK 
announced that it would consult on 
potential new approaches during 2024. 
We note that no system of allocation 
can solve the problem of a lack of 
capacity, and these should not be 
conflated. We therefore continue to 
impress on policymakers the benefits 
of a global system that supports new 
market entrants and allows network 
airlines to plan their complex schedules 
in advance so that they can offer 
customers a wide range of destinations 
and connections while also managing 
operational disruption effectively. 

In our ongoing activities to explain our 
position, the Group and its operating 
airlines continued to engage with 
representatives of the institutions of 
the EU and the governments of Spain, 
Ireland and the UK. We have long 
advocated the development of 
Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) which 
reduces lifecycle CO2 emissions by 80% 
as the solution, not just to the near-term 
need to drive down industry emissions, 
complementing the deployment of 
more efficient aircraft, but also to enable 
sustainable long-haul aviation alongside 
the development of carbon capture 
technology and future generation e-fuels. 

In Europe, high-level engagement 
continued on the most relevant of 
the EU’s Fit for 55 policies including 
the aviation SAF blending mandate 
(ReFuel EU aviation) and the revision 
of the Emissions Trading System (ETS) 
Directive for Aviation. IAG welcomed 
the EU’s commitment of 20 million 
free SAF allowances to encourage SAF 
uptake between 2024 and 2030 and the 
increase to the ETS innovation fund 
budget to help deploy net zero 
and innovative technologies. In 2023, 
aviation was also included in the 
EU Taxonomy as one of the sectors 
that has the potential to contribute 
significantly to climate change mitigation. 

While the Group continues to support 
the principles and approach of the EU’s 
Green Deal we maintained our 
opposition, aligned with other airlines, 
to the proposed removal of the jet 
fuel tax exemption since it will reduce 
the sector’s ability to invest in more 
effective measures and to enable 
a competitive European aviation sector. 
IAG’s technical experts and senior 
executives engaged with relevant 
officials at the European Commission, 
the Representations of Member 
States in Brussels as well as Members 
of the European Parliament, and with 
complementary contacts with the 
relevant authorities in the respective 
EU hubs, in Madrid, Dublin and Barcelona.

Financial StatementsCorporate GovernanceStrategic ReportRegulatory environment continued

Some alleviations from the elements of 
slot rules that require airlines to operate 
any one slot 80% of the time to retain 
it in the following year have remained 
in place around the world during 2023. 
IAG welcomed such alleviations as they 
recognise the continuing uncertainty 
that global supply chain issues and 
short-term uncertainty in demand in 
individual markets have caused. As we 
have seen in the Middle East, in the last 
quarter of 2023 there are continued 
pressures on airlines which are often 
prevented from operating individual 
flights. We continue to advocate a 
pragmatic approach by airport slot 
coordinators to recognise the reality of 
factors outside airlines’ control and that 
justify retaining slots for the longer-term 
benefit of airlines and their customers. 

Since around one third of flights 
in Europe operate through French 
airspace, the very frequent strikes 
by air traffic controllers in France put 
further pressure on operations. IAG 
continues to make representations with 
other airlines and A4E, to encourage 
EU and French government action to 
allow free movement of traffic flying 
over France during industrial action, 
a policy already adopted by several 
other EU Member States. 

“IAG maintained close 
engagement with 
regulators in key markets 
around the world to 
ensure positive relations 
and to ensure the 
benefits of its operations 
are understood.”

Aviation regulators’ concern for the 
consumer interest is understandable 
following the disruption of 2022 and 
in the light of external factors, and there 
were related developments in different 
jurisdictions for IAG’s operating airlines. 
In the EU, national authorities responded 
to the industry recovery and high 
consumer demand in different ways, 
ranging from proposals to cap airfares 
in one EU Member State, to proposals 
to establish minimum fares in another. 
IAG engaged with policymakers 
to explain the benefits to consumers 
of the choice available to them in the 
competitive aviation market in the EU.

In the UK, IAG engaged with the Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA) on plans to 
introduce an accessibility framework 
for airlines, to mirror its existing system 
that grades airports on the quality of 
their provision of wheelchairs. IAG’s 
operating airlines encourage support 
for passengers with additional needs 
and believe that cross-industry 
engagement and communication to 
improve customer service will have 
better results for passengers affected 
than regulation. The UK also consulted 
on potential rules to restrict ‘drip pricing’ 
during online sales to ensure customers 
have all the relevant information at the 
appropriate point of purchase. Canada 
also introduced new requirements for 
airlines to set out their accessibility 
policies and consulted on proposals 
to increase passenger protection. 
Similarly, the US published notices 
of proposed rulemaking in several 
areas including to improve the provision 
of refunds to customers. At the end 
of 2023, the European Commission 
presented a proposal on multimodal 
passenger rights with a focus on 
passenger rights for access to tickets 
covering different transport modes. 

IAG responded to relevant consultations 
and engaged directly and through our 
trade associations to inform regulators, 
propose balanced regulation and avoid 
introducing additional rules that hamper 
the competitiveness of the industry. 
The Spanish Presidency of the EU 
in 2023 gave an additional opportunity 
to engage in Madrid and Brussels. 

Economic regulation of monopoly 
infrastructure 
Aviation infrastructure and price 
regulation was another area of focus 
in 2023. In Ireland, the DAA appealed 
against the Irish Aviation Authority’s 
December 2022 decision on the 
maximum level of airport charges at 
Dublin Airport for the period 2023-2026. 
This decision, which takes account of the 
impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had 
on the aviation industry, also provides 
for a capital investment allowance of 
approximately €3 billion. IAG was 
broadly supportive of the IAA’s final 
determination of charges and has joined 
the appeal proceedings as a notice party.

In Spain, IATA and Spanish airline 
association ALA opposed AENA’s 
proposal to increase charges for 2024 
that would break the cap in the airport 
regulation document (DORA II) that 
sets AENA’s airport charges scheme 
for 2022-2026. IAG broadly supports 
the associations’ objections. 

In October, the UK Competition and 
Markets Authority confirmed through 
its consideration of airline and airport 
appeals that it was essentially satisfied 
with the CAA’s economic review of 
London Heathrow airport’s charges. 
It is positive that charges in 2024 will be 
lower in nominal terms than in 2023 and 
then essentially flat for the remainder of 
the regulatory period to 2026. However, 
the very significant increase permitted 
in 2022 and 2023 (despite not allowing 
most of the London Heathrow airport 

56

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

to recoup revenues not earned due to 
the pandemic) means that London 
Heathrow airport’s charges remain 
among the highest in the world and 
are not competitive. IAG seeks to work 
with the CAA and the Department 
for Transport to improve the regulatory 
framework for the future.

The importance of aviation infrastructure 
to airlines and their customers was 
highlighted by the failure of the UK’s 
National Air Traffic Services (NATS) 
on 28 August due to a software failure. 
Although services recovered on the 
same day, an almost complete outage 
of service for several hours resulted 
in considerable cost to IAG’s operating 
airlines, not only in managing the outage 
but also providing customers with the 
necessary duty of care, accommodation, 
communication and travel costs. IAG’s 
airlines recognise the need to look after 
their customers in this way but 
encourage the reform of consumer 
regulation EU261 and the UK equivalent 
to recognise that ANSPs and airports 
should equally be responsible for the 
costs incurred where their actions are 
the cause of delays and cancellations.

This unfortunate NATS incident came 
during the regulator’s consideration 
of its regulatory price review, the results 
of which see a 25% increase in average 
unit rate in nominal terms compared 
with 2022. This increase is driven by the 
fact that the regulatory system includes 
a traffic risk-sharing system that 
effectively allows NATS to recover 
the lost revenue from the pandemic. 
The decision does however include 
reductions in NATS En Route Limited’s 
underlying cost base through to 2027 
and provides a balance of efficiency 
and effective service provision.

Through A4E, IAG also engaged 
in discussions with the European 
Commission’s Performance Review 
Body, aiming to encourage improved 
efficiency, better value for money and 
enhanced operational performance 
from ANSPs in Europe. IAG supports 
the implementation of the Single 
European Sky to deliver environmental 
and economic benefits over the 
longer term.

International relations
IAG maintained close engagement 
with regulators in key markets around 
the world to ensure positive relations 
and to ensure the benefits of its 
operations are understood. This includes 
monitoring developments in 
international air service agreements 
and contributing to government talks, 
where appropriate, between the states 
in which IAG’s operating airlines are 
based and states representing important 
markets around the world. 

For example, in November this included 
attending the special meeting of the 
EU-US Joint Committee on air transport 
that explored the US’ complaint 
against the EU relating to the reduction 
in capacity imposed at Amsterdam 
Schiphol airport. Along with other 
airlines, IAG contends that any such 
questions of capacity should be resolved 
with reference to the ICAO Balanced 
Approach that considers the benefits 
and negative aspects of aviation activity 
fairly. We welcomed the Government 
of the Netherlands’ decision in October 
to halt its plans and continue to 
advocate the continued use of all 
available capacity at Amsterdam 
Schiphol airport and to address 
environmental concerns through 
other measures.

British Airways 
for everyone

Business overview
In 2023 we continued to focus on 
our recovery and the transformation 
of our business to create a better 
British Airways for our customers 
and our colleagues. We delivered 
a strong operating profit, continued 
to strengthen our balance sheet and 
materially reduce our debt, enabling 
us to supercharge our transformation 
through a £7 billion investment into 
our customer and colleague experience 
over the next three years. 

While we have seen a large number of 
customers flying with us this year and 
demand for travel approaching pre-
pandemic levels, we recognise business 
travel continues to recover at a slower 
pace than anticipated, with incremental 
improvements throughout the year, 
offset by a continued strong leisure 
performance. There is no denying 
we continued to experience a number 
of headwinds throughout the year, 
many of which were outside our control 
and caused disruption to our customers’ 
travel plans. This included air traffic 
control constraints, the August Bank 
Holiday National Air Traffic Services 
(NATS) outage, an increase in adverse 
weather conditions and ongoing supply 
chain issues. We worked hard to 
alleviate the factors within our control 
and put a renewed focus on building 
a more robust operation, punctuality 
and investment in our customer 
experience, our people and in our 
sustainability commitments as part 
of our BA Better World programme.

Our people 
We know our people are key to our 
success and we’re extremely grateful 
for their continued hard work and the 
outstanding contributions they make 
to our business. We’re focused on 
improving pride and trust with our 
colleagues and creating a culture that 
makes them feel valued and empowered 
to do the right thing for our customers. 
We completed the roll out of our 

“We continue to rebuild 
our airline, putting 
a laser focus on 
transformation across 
the whole business, 
to ensure we deliver 
for our customers, 
our investors and 
our people.”

new uniform, designed by Savile Row 
tailoring expert Ozwald Boateng, to our 
30,000 uniform-wearing colleagues and 
began investment in transforming our 
workspaces, unveiling new colleague 
rest areas at our airports and hangars 
and collaborative workspaces in our 
offices. We’re taking positive action 
to drive inclusion across our airline, but 
we don’t shy away from the fact that 
there is more work to be done. We 
continue to champion and encourage 
our colleague-led networks and 
celebrate different perspectives, 
backgrounds and experiences. 
We launched an industry-leading 
fully-funded cadet pilot training 
programme, making the profession 
accessible to everyone. Throughout the 
year we recruited 7,500 new colleagues 
into the business and continued to build 
more constructive relationships with the 
trade unions that represent our people 
and enhanced our staff travel policies. 
Our recent colleague survey results 
show increased levels of engagement 
that indicate we’re making progress in 
rebuilding trust with our people. 

Our customers 
We continue to invest for our customers 
and remain focused on improving 
the customer experience and our 
Net Promoter Score. In 2023 we took 
delivery of 10 new fuel-efficient aircraft, 
continued to fit our business cabin seat, 
the Club Suite, onto our existing 
long-haul fleet and are providing our 
engagement centre colleagues with 
more tools and new technology to 
better assist our customers. 

We’ve also ramped up our extensive 
transformation programme, which 
includes innovation across every area 
of our business between 2024 and 2026. 
We have more than 600 initiatives 
underway which range from trialling 
biometrics on selected international 
flights to speed up the boarding 
process, to using artificial intelligence 
and situational awareness tools 
to improve our operational efficiency 
and enhance the customer experience. 

We continue to connect Britain with 
the world and the world with Britain, 
and in 2023 launched new routes to 
Cincinnati, Riga, Belgrade and Cologne 
from Heathrow and services to Aruba, 
Guyana, Accra, Fuerteventura 
and Sharm El Sheikh from Gatwick. 
Following a three-year period 
of suspended operations due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, we resumed 
operations to mainland China and 
announced we will be returning 
to Abu Dhabi in summer 2024. 

We also continue to improve our 
Executive Club loyalty programme 
and, in conjunction with IAG Loyalty, 
launched Avios-Only flights to a number 
of short-haul destinations across our 
network, where every seat is exclusively 

58

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

available for purchase using the loyalty 
currency. As part of this proposition, 
we announced we will operate our first 
long-haul Avios-Only flight to Dubai 
in late 2024. 

Our planet
We remain fully committed to reducing 
the impact flying has on our planet and 
sustainability has continued to be front 
and centre of our business strategy. 

All flights departing from London 
Heathrow now fly with a small amount 
of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) 
and we continue to work closely with 
industry and government to scale up 
development, which is urgently needed. 
Through partnerships in the UK and USA, 
we continue to invest in SAF. Recently 
Project Speedbird, our partnership with 

Nova Pangaea Technologies and 
LanzaJet, secured £9 million in funding 
from the Government’s Advanced Fuels 
Fund. We’re also empowering our 
customers to address their emissions, 
via our CO2llaborate platform, where 
customers can choose to purchase 
carbon removal credits or SAF before, 
during or after their flight. 

In 2023, we celebrated raising more than 
£28 million for Flying Start, our charity 
partnership with Comic Relief, since our 
partnership began in 2010, and 10 years of 
partnership with the Disasters Emergency 
Committee (DEC). Through our BA Better 
World Community Fund, our customers 
and colleagues helped to raise more than 
£5 million in funding to support more than 
170 charities across the UK.

Looking forward 
We remain committed to operating 
a strong and stable schedule and 
delivering for our customers and 
colleagues by running an airline of which 
they can be proud, whilst managing our 
costs and ensuring we’re operating 
safely and efficiently. As we transform 
our business, we continue to modernise 
our fleet with the delivery in 2024 of 
more than 14 next generation fuel-
efficient aircraft, invest in our customer 
and colleague experience, and consider 
our environmental impact at every stage 
as we work together with our people 
to create a better British Airways for 
everyone.

Delivering on our 
transformation

Business overview
In 2023, we saw a strong financial 
performance that has allowed us to 
make an early repayment of debt, which 
was guaranteed by Spain’s Instituto de 
Crédito Oficial (ICO). These results have 
been possible due to a favourable 
macroeconomic environment, and the 
improvement of inbound tourism to 
Spain, which has seen an increase in the 
number of tourists and levels of 
consumer spending.

Iberia has continued to be ahead of its 
competitors during 2023 in terms of 
capacity, which, along with the supply-
demand imbalance we are seeing in the 
industry, has been a key driver of our 
remarkable results.

We added six Airbus A350-900, three 
A320neo and six A321neo aircraft to the 
Iberia and Iberia Express fleets, which 
are at the core of our transition towards 
a more sustainable aviation industry. We 
have expanded our network by opening 
new routes such as Doha and Cairo, and 
increased frequencies to important 
destinations such as Bogotá and Lima.

As part of our commitment to develop the 
connectivity and competitiveness of the 
Madrid hub, we continue to make 
progress on our proposed acquisition of 
Air Europa. The acquisition remains 
subject to securing the required approvals 
and is expected to take place between 18 
to 24 months after our announcement of 
the transaction in February 2023.

In September, we lost the handling 
licences at eight Spanish airports, 
including Barcelona and Palma de 
Mallorca; however, we have won and 
maintained the licence to operate other 
major airports such as Madrid Barajas.

Our people 
Once again Iberia's employees have been 
the company's greatest asset. Team effort 
is what makes it possible to achieve the 
highest standards of quality every day.

“In 2023, we achieved an 
historic operating result 
in terms of absolute 
profit and operating 
margin. We have 
benefited from a positive 
industry environment 
and continue to deliver 
on the transformation 
we have been executing 
for over a decade.”

In 2023 we reaffirmed our unwavering 
commitment to creating and maintaining 
stable and high-quality employment, and 
to do so we have improved the working 
conditions and salaries of our entire 
workforce. 

At Iberia contractual agreements are 
being implemented across our 
businesses as a sign of our commitment 
to the wellbeing and professional 
development of our team.

At Iberia Express, we reached collective 
bargaining agreements with our pilots 
and cabin crew until 2025.

In addition, 164 pilots, 512 cabin crew 
and 222 maintenance staff joined Iberia’s 
workforce.

Our customers
Operational excellence and punctuality 
are key factors for our customers. Iberia 
and Iberia Express have been the most 
punctual airlines in Europe and Iberia 
fifth globally, according to the 2023 
Cirum On-Time Performance Review. 
Also, we have reached historic levels in 
both NPS and customer satisfaction, by 
improving our engagement culture and 
all customer communications.

In 2023, we continued to roll out our new 
business cabin, thanks to the arrival of 
four new latest-generation Airbus 
A350-900s, together with two leased 
A350-900s. The aircraft have 
contributed not only to operational 
improvements, but also provide greater 
comfort in all cabins, with enhanced 
privacy, increased space and new 
lighting environments. These aircraft 
offer state-of-the-art connectivity and 
in-flight entertainment so passengers 
can enjoy their experience to the fullest.

We redesigned the in-flight meals 
throughout our network. We renewed 
our offering in the economy and 
premium economy cabins on long-haul 
flights by introducing a between-meals 
service, while our business cabin now 
includes healthy products, such as fresh 
fruit, as part of the on-board meals.

All these improvements have allowed us 
to retain our 4 Skytrax stars this year.

Our planet
In 2023, we continued working on the 
development of our sustainability 
strategy, to drive forward the transition of 
the industry. Iberia and Repsol joined 
forces in March to offer the purchase of 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to our 
corporate clients, allowing them to reduce 
the emissions of their business trips.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

In September, we presented ‘All4Zero’, a 
unique industrial innovation hub formed 
alongside ArcelorMittal, Holcim and 
Repsol, created to promote disruptive 
technologies around sustainable fuels. In 
November, Iberia Express obtained 
IATA’s IEnvA environmental certification 
for the airline’s commitment to 
sustainability and in December, Iberia 
implemented the IAGOS system on an 
Airbus A330-200 to record the 
composition of the atmosphere for the 
subsequent development of more 
accurate weather and climate models.

This year we reduced our carbon 
intensity by 13.0% compared to 2019, 
bringing us ahead of our 2025 target. 

Looking forward
During 2024 we will continue improving 
our long-haul operation with the delivery 
of our first A321 XLR allowing us to 
address long-haul destinations with 
a new and more flexible aircraft.

On handling, after the outcome of the 
tender for licences, we have been 
progressing to reach a solution both 
from the business perspective and for 
the people in affected airports. 

Our operational excellence, our improved 
revenue performance and our cost 
model will allow Iberia to look forward to 
2024 with optimism, even if the current 
macroeconomic and supply-demand 
imbalance tailwinds will be a challenge. 

In 2023, we improved the 
working and salary conditions 
of our entire workforce.

Connecting 
people and places

Business overview
The Vueling mission statement talks 
about our love of connecting people and 
places, and in 2023 we did so more than 
ever: we flew almost 37 million 
passengers, a Vueling record.

We achieved strong operating profits, 
supported by one of the best-
performing operations in Europe. 
Not only are we taking advantage 
of the strong recovery in demand, 
but we are emerging from the pandemic 
crisis stronger.

When we talk about our transformation, 
there are some examples that say it all: 

•  our punctuality placed us among the 

top European airlines: 80% of 
flights departed within 15 minutes 
of schedule, 4.7 points above 2019. 
For our customers, we are now 
at another level;

•  our line maintenance allows us to have 

half as many aircraft grounded for 
technical reasons, compared to 2019;
•  we drastically reduced our seasonality. 
In 2019 we had 40% more activity in 
summer than in winter. In 2023 we 
reduced this difference by half, 
allowing us to be much more efficient. 
We operated 8.5% more available seat 
kilometres in 2023 than in 2019, driven 
by this successful increase in 
winter capacity;

•  our ancillary revenues doubled 

compared to 2019; and

•  our load factor reached 91.4%, 
4.5 points higher than in 2019. 

Like many airlines, Vueling was 
impacted in 2023 by Pratt & Whitney 
geared turbofan engine issues. 
We mitigated these impacts by 
optimising our fleet plan, re-balancing 
capacity across months, wet leases, 
and other measures.

“Our transformation 
is positioning Vueling 
among the 
top-performing 
European low-cost 
carriers, thanks to 
the great efforts of 
our 4,700 colleagues.”

Our people 
All this has been possible thanks to 
the efforts of everyone at Vueling, 
managing day-to-day operations and 
supporting our transformation at the 
same time. 

Reflecting the responsibility and care that 
we have for our people, and as part of 
our transformation plan, we continued 
improving our work environment. 
For example, we launched a new 
programme for our people’s health 
and wellbeing, which we call ‘Make It 
Healthy’, and we organised a number 
of outside-of-work opportunities for 
people to connect, including our 
inaugural Vueling family and friends day.

In 2023, we achieved a critical milestone: 
we signed a new collective labour 
agreement with our cabin crews and 
office team in Spain, which recognises 
and rewards their dedication while 
maintaining a sustainable cost structure. 
Our aim remains to reach a sustainable 
agreement with our pilots in Spain, 
enabling us to unlock our growth 
potential.

We set down a manifesto to make clear 
our commitment to diversity, equity and 
inclusion. This commitment is reflected 
in the equity plan that we signed with 
our unions and in the Vueling 
Management Committee.

Our customers 
We know that customers have a choice 
when they fly, so we are fully 
focused on providing an experience 
that differentiates Vueling from other 
low-cost carriers.

In addition to delivering one of the 
most on-time operations in Europe, 
we upgraded the Vueling customer 
experience in other ways too. 
We enhanced the use of biometric 
technology at Barcelona, Madrid, Palma 
de Mallorca, Ibiza and Menorca airports, 
implemented a new social media 
platform to make our case management 
more efficient, and partnered 
with industry-leading technology 
organisations to digitalise our customer 
care and disruption management.

In recognition of our outstanding 
customer service, Sotto Tempo 
Advertising gave Vueling the award 
for Servicio de Atención al Cliente 
del Año (Customer Service of the Year) 
in the airlines category, based on 
independent market research. 

Our planet
Increasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) 
supply and adoption is essential for 
reaching Vueling and IAG’s net zero carbon 
emissions target. Vueling engaged public 
institutions and potential SAF producers 
through workshops and roadshows, to 
communicate the benefits that SAF 
production can create for the environment, 
employment and the economy. We 

62

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

engaged our customers through a new 
online CO2 calculator that allows them to 
estimate their carbon footprint before 
deciding whether to pay for SAF and 
carbon capture. We engaged all Vueling 
employees to elicit creative ideas on how 
we can further promote SAF development.

We also take seriously our commitment 
to society. Airlines are uniquely 
positioned to facilitate humanitarian 
aid after natural disasters, and Vueling 
operated humanitarian missions 
to Turkey after the earthquakes in 
February, Tenerife after the wildfire 
in August, and Morocco after the 
earthquake in September. We also 
collaborated with Make-A-Wish, Lovaas 
Foundation and Save the Children to 
support children in vulnerable situations, 
and we celebrated our tenth year of 
collaboration with the Spanish 
Organización Nacional de Trasplantes 
(National Transplant Organisation).

Looking forward 
We are proud of the progress we are 
making, yet we are aware that we are 
still just halfway through the journey 
to reaching our full potential – to be 
the leading low-cost carrier in all the 
markets we choose to serve. On this 
journey, we will overcome industry 
challenges such as geared turbofan 
engine issues. We need to reach a 
sustainable agreement with our pilots in 
Spain as a necessary condition for 
investment in Vueling’s growth and fleet. 
We will continue the many other 
transformation initiatives that are 
delivering measurable results.

In short, the transformation continues. 
It is how we are ensuring Vueling’s 
long-term competitiveness, and it is what 
will allow us to do even more of what we 
love: connecting people and places. 

Top: New generation aircraft reduce 
fuel burn and CO2 emissions by 20% 
with respect to their predecessors.

Bottom left: Vueling introduced a 
Honeywell fuel efficiency app to all its 
pilots, with the purpose of sharing 
operational and best practices data to 
enhance decision-making in their 
day-to-day duties.

Bottom right: Vueling is the very first 
commercial airline in Europe and the 
first low-cost carrier to be awarded the 
Top Employer certification.

Building 
a stronger 
Aer Lingus

Business overview
The year 2023 saw growth, in both 
capacity and profit, supported by 
investment in digital transformation 
and enhanced customer experience. 
Strong demand for leisure travel led 
to an exceptional summer, delivering 
our highest-ever third-quarter profits.

Business travel recovery continues to 
lag that of leisure, which has put 
pressure on profitability in the off-peak 
months and exacerbated the seasonality 
of Aer Lingus’ results. We built our North 
Atlantic leadership position; we now 
have the fourth largest number of direct 
destinations from Europe into the US. 
We expanded into secondary cities, 
leveraging the geography and US 
preclearance facility at our Dublin hub, 
adding a new route to Cleveland which 
performed really well in its first year. 
On our European network, demand 
for major sun destinations and new 
Mediterranean routes was exceptionally 
strong, while the resurgence in demand 
for European city breaks also 
contributed to a strong summer. 
A focus on operational performance 
led to process improvements and quick 
recovery from disruption events such 
as the UK’s aircraft control (NATS) 
outage in August. Nevertheless, 
the summer operation was challenging, 
most notably due to aircraft availability 
and to ongoing Air Traffic Control issues 
in Dublin, the UK and France. 

We started 2023 with a new brand 
advert and tagline “You’re very 
welcome” showcasing the warmth of our 
service and our people. This was 
underpinned by ‘customer first’ training 
for over 2,500 colleagues. The strength 
of our brand and the improvements in 
customer experience were reflected in a 
higher Net Promoter Score.

“Our largest summer 
schedule delivered 
a peak performance 
underpinning 
our profitability.”

Our customers 
We delivered a significant 
transformation in our Customer Contact 
Centre following the difficult post 
COVID-19 restart, and we are now 
providing a vastly improved service 
to customers. Technology investment, 
workflow change, process redesign 
and bot automation collectively have 
brought average wait times to 
consistently below two minutes, with 
90% of calls directed to the appropriate 
agent. Overall customer satisfaction 
rates are now 30% higher than in 2022.

Our investment in digital improvements 
is also making a difference to our 
customers, with additional information 
and functionality on our app, resulting 
in a better ‘day of travel’ experience. 
Our ability to continue improving the 
customer experience has been greatly 
advanced with the introduction of 
Salesforce, allowing us deeper insights 
into our customers and enabling us 
to offer a personalised and digital-led 
experience throughout their travel journey. 

Recognising loyalty is also important 
to customers. We have continued 
to work closely with IAG Loyalty 
to enhance our offers and services 
to AerClub members, an effective 
partnership that has seen us expand 
our AerClub membership to 2.4 million 
customers, a 28% increase from 2022.

Our people 
Our people go above and beyond every 
day to deliver for our customers. They 
are the people who make what we do 
possible. In 2023, we continued to 
improve communication and 
engagement with our colleagues. Our 
ambition is to create an inclusive 
environment, where our people are 
aligned with our strategy 
and recommend Aer Lingus as a place 
to work. We want everyone to feel 
empowered to own the brand promise 
“We are simply people who do 
everything we can for the people who 
fly with us.” We launched a new digital 
communications platform 
company-wide, AerWaves. After only 
three-months, over two-thirds of our 
colleagues have signed up. This enables 
us to share knowledge while fostering 
a sense of belonging and teamwork 
in the airline. In response to feedback, 
we have also created an Idea Hub, 
where employees can contribute 
suggestions for continuous 
improvement across the company. 

We have also made significant progress 
in industrial relations starting with a new 
pay deal with Dublin Ground Handling 
staff and then with cabin crew based 
in both Ireland and Manchester. 
Importantly we reached a pay 
agreement with our line maintenance 
engineers which will help us retain 
and attract talent, while providing 

64

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

better work coverage to support 
our operations. 

Following the rejection by pilots of a pay 
tribunal recommendation, Aer Lingus 
and the pilots’ representative 
organisation (IALPA) commenced 
further discussions in the Workplace 
Relations Commission (Ireland’s 
employment conciliation service).

As part of our mission to improve 
diversity and inclusion at Aer Lingus 
we have placed much focus on female 
pilot recruitment. Aer Lingus ranks third 
in the world in terms of the proportion 
of female pilots (11% of our total) and 
we are determined to increase this, 
starting with the significant jump 
we achieved in female applications for 
our Future Pilot Programme in 2023.

Our planet
Further steps were made in our 
commitment to sustainability, 
and we were pleased to attain IATA's 
Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) 
Stage 2 certification. 

In 2023, Aer Lingus became the first 
airline flying into Ireland to segregate and 
recycle on-board waste. We now recycle 
waste from over 90% of short-haul flights 
into Ireland and have completed trials 
on long-haul routes, with a target to 
recycle 20% of on-board waste by 2024.

Other important steps in our sustainability 
journey in 2023 were the investment in 
two new Airbus A320neo aircraft, and the

ground vehicles at Dublin Airport.

Looking forward 
In 2024 we will maintain our North 
Atlantic leadership from Dublin whilst 
continuing to offer an attractive 
schedule for European leisure travel. 

Dublin Airport has lodged a planning 
application to increase the passenger 
cap at the hub airport from 32 million to 
40 million passengers per year. Aer Lingus 
has supported the application and is 
engaging with relevant stakeholders on 
what is required to accommodate future 

growth by Aer Lingus out of Dublin. The 
airline has also supported the relaxation 
of night-flight restrictions at the airport. 
Both issues are currently going through 
the Irish planning process and the timing 
and manner of resolution is uncertain.

The Aer Lingus transformation 
programme is well underway, and many 
more projects are in the pipeline for 2024 
– encompassing hub development, 
deepening partnerships, modernising IT, 
increasing data and digitalisation, and 
investment in our people. 

We are committed to developing 
Aer Lingus as a growing, profitable, 
customer-centric airline, with a strong 
brand and a great place to work.

A record-breaking 
year, with more 
to come

Business overview
In 2023, we again saw record-breaking 
performance as we both materially 
improved our core customer proposition 
and expanded our business in 
new directions. 

We have seen record growth in both 
collection and redemption of Avios, 
driven by new opportunities we are 
creating for our customers. We are 
also in the process of transforming 
IAG Loyalty’s data capabilities, which 
represents a major opportunity to drive 
our business forward by unlocking 
opportunities to better target potential 
customers. External partners continue 
to account for over 80% of our billed 
revenue. With the return of collection 
from flying and higher redemptions, our 
operating margin continues to normalise 
to pre-COVID-19 levels, and now stands 
at 22%. We are developing Avios to be 
a global currency, and a new partnership 
with Finnair will see the airline adopting 
Avios as its currency from 2024. Our 
newest retail venture, The Wine Flyer, 
saw strong revenue growth this year. 
We remain committed to launching 
another new business in 2024, under the 
direction of our new Chief growth officer. 

Our people 
Our commitment to a compelling people 
proposition continued to support IAG 
Loyalty's success in 2023. Anchored 
in our people plan – encompassing 
talent development, people experience 
and culture – we continued to focus 
on attracting, growing and retaining 
engaged talent to fuel our ambitious 
growth plans. We remain grateful to 
our colleagues for all their hard work 
this year.

As part of our people-centric strategy, 
we formed colleague squads, dedicated 
to missions like Charity, Equity, Diversity 
and Inclusion (EDI) and our recent 
workspace relocation. These missions 

“In 2023 our business 
reached new heights 
once again. More Avios 
were issued and 
redeemed than 
ever before.”

empower colleagues to deepen their 
connection to IAG Loyalty and play their 
part in enhancing the overall experience. 

Highlights include the selection of a new 
charity partner – Winston's Wish – for 
which we have raised almost £50,000 
so far, and a calendar of EDI events and 
moments that matter that drive a strong 
sense of belonging. 

Our colleague listening indicators show 
that IAG Loyalty colleagues have 
a strong sense of belonging and feel 
empowered to contribute to the success 
of the business in multiple ways. As we 
look forward to 2024, the people plan will 
remain integral to IAG Loyalty's growth. 

Our customers 
In 2023, our programme saw significant 
growth in member engagement 
compared to our previous highs in 2019. 
For example, members are earning 29% 
more Avios and redeeming 35% more 
Avios on average than they did in 2019.

In 2023, we launched Avios-only flights 
with British Airways, with 100% of seats 
available exclusively to Executive Club 
members redeeming with Avios. We also 
launched Avios Balance Booster, which 
allows customers to pay to multiply the 
Avios they have recently collected by 
one times, two times, or three times. We 
have been delighted with our customers’ 
response to both products.

We also completed the transition of 
all the IAG airlines’ loyalty programmes 
to a spend-based model when earning 
Avios. This system is simpler and fairer, 
and we expect member engagement 
to increase further as a result. 

We continue to add collection partners 
to our ecosystem, as well as growing 
our relationship with newer partners like 
Uber. We launched six new partnerships 
this year, giving our customers the 
ability to earn Avios with new retailers 
and financial services providers across 
multiple countries. Total billings on our 
British Airways American Express 
co-brand credit card grew more than 
19% this year. Spend across our UK card 
portfolio is now the equivalent value of 
more than 1% of UK GDP.

Our planet
2023 has seen continued growth 
of member donations to charity. Iberia 
Plus members, through Avios Solidarios, 
have donated generously to support 
their choice of non-governmental 
organisation. British Airways Executive 
Club members have continued to 
support causes through the BA Better 
World Community Fund using Avios. 
This initiative was launched in November 
2022, with over £200,000 raised 
through a combination of members’ 
Avios donations and match funding 
provided by IAG Loyalty.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

From November 2023, British Airways 
Executive Club members can choose 
to contribute to British Airways’ 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel fund using 
their Avios onboard short-haul flights 
via the High Life Café. 

We will continue to expand the ways 
in which loyalty can be used for good 
by providing more ways to give back 
and recognising and rewarding 
customers who choose to do so.

Looking forward 
We will continue to grow our core 
business in 2024 by evolving our 
customer proposition and growing 
opportunities for our members to collect 
and spend Avios on rewarding 
experiences. We will also be investing 
in expansion into new areas. We expect 
this growth to bring new operational 
challenges, as we work to manage a 
business that is increasingly complex. 
Our focus is maintaining strong margins 
at the same time we seek to deliver 
double-digit growth, and to be a central 
part of overall Group profitability.

Turning vision into 
transformation

“Our transformation 
journey in 2023 
was all about our 
customers and our 
team. We made 
substantial progress, 
continually improving 
our customer 
experience and 
fostering a workplace 
where talent thrives.”

David Shepherd
Managing Director of IAG Cargo

Business overview
Our strategy has undoubtedly been put 
to the test during 2023, but increased 
premium handling capacity, improved 
productivity in our operations and 
a strong transformation programme 
have combined to deliver a robust 
performance, relative to market. I would 
like to thank all our colleagues around 
the world for their hard work and 
contribution to us achieving this result. 
The anticipated supply-side growth 
driven by the rebound of global 
passenger capacity, combined with a 
greater-than-expected decline in 
demand, has resulted in the softest 
global air cargo market since the 2009 
global financial crisis. The resulting 
decline in prices from peak pandemic 
levels has been seen globally, although 
they have not receded to pre-pandemic 
levels.

We have delivered revenues 3.5% higher 
than pre-pandemic 2019 levels on 14.4% 
lower available tonne kilometres (ATKs), 
despite a detrimental network mix 
relative to 2019 with Asian flying 
hindered by longer flying hours due to 
the Ukraine conflict. We have continued 
to deliver our ambitious strategy 
of transformation, opening our new 
premium operation at London Heathrow 
which improves our pharmaceutical 
offering in particular, whilst reconnecting 
with customers and improving both 
productivity and product quality.

Our people 
Making IAG Cargo a great place to work 
continues to be a top priority. In 2023, 
we invested in our people in a number 
of ways: refreshing facilities, improving 
training delivery and continuing to build 
on a culture change founded in our 
core values.

We launched our new flagship 
development programme, Leading 
the Way, supported by a brand-new 
learning hub at our headquarters. 

Over 500 colleagues from 13 countries 
attended the course in person in 2023.

We launched Pride in Our People, IAG 
Cargo's first people awards programme 
that recognises the dedication of six 
individuals delivering on the themes 
of our values, of determined attitudes, 
collaborative actions, curious minds and 
heartfelt pride, with two special awards 
for rising star and leading the way.

We are making significant progress 
in our commitment to Equity, Diversity, 
and Inclusion (EDI) by advancing gender 
parity in an industry where it has 
traditionally been more difficult to do so. 
This includes our supporting the 2023 
everywoman in Transport and Logistics 
Awards. We took second-place position 
in the Lead5050 Equity Index 2022/23, 
and we were finalists in two categories 
at the Multicultural Apprenticeship 
Awards 2023.

Our customers 
During 2023, our network expanded: we 
welcomed China back after almost two 
years, opened Cincinnati, an important 
hub for ecommerce, added a new 
service between Doha and Madrid, and 
increased capacity to Accra. Through 
our Partner Ready programme, we 
partnered with other carriers to sell 
routings on a more connected interline 
basis, growing our network and offering 
new routings to our customers, 
improving their market choice. 

We invested significantly in our cargo 
handling capabilities, opening a semi-
automated state-of-the-art Premium 
cargo facility at London Heathrow, 
over 10,000m2 which has allowed us 
to double the volume of express, 
pharmaceutical and specialist products 
we manage every day. Sales of our 
product for the transportation of 
temperature-sensitive cargo, which is a 
key focus area for IAG Cargo, saw an 
17.9% increase versus 2022.

At our Madrid hub, a €1 million 
investment for perishable goods was 
completed, expanding our handling 
capacity. We introduced dynamic spot 
rates in 2023. This capability uses 
artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive 
analytical technology to ensure that our 
pricing remains relevant and optimal at 
all points of sale. We have grown our 
distribution channels and increased 
digital bookings throughout the year, 
and our continued development in 
this area will move us toward a more 
complete digital distribution capability.

Our planet
We are proud to be a socially 
responsible business with a real 
commitment to having a positive impact 
in the communities in which we operate.

In 2023, we initiated a humanitarian 
emergency response supporting 
several charities to deliver aid to Turkey 

68

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

following the devastating earthquake. 
Our ‘Day to Make a Difference’ initiative, 
now in its second year, saw colleagues 
support a range of community projects, 
from revamping neglected community 
gardens to supporting a children’s 
NGO in India. 

We collaborated with London’s Natural 
History Museum to transport the cast 
and fossils of one of the world’s largest 
dinosaurs from Buenos Aires to London 
for its educational exhibition ‘Titanosaur: 
Life as the biggest dinosaur’.

We broadened our electric and hybrid 
vehicle testing programmes with the goal 
of replacing all existing diesel vehicles 
across our campus. Additionally, we 
enhanced our commitment to the 
necessary infrastructure by expanding the 
availability of electrical charging stations 
for our customers, colleagues and visitors. 

In 2023, we supported several 
customers to reduce their Scope 3 
carbon emissions by over 90,000 
tonnes through the purchase of 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel. We are 

accelerating the digitalisation of all 
documents across our business, 
supporting customers to transition to 
e-Airway Billing (eAWB) with an 
ambition to get to 100% as quickly as 
possible. The digitalisation of 
documentation is not only positive for 
the environment but offers a more 
seamless end-to-end service for 
customers, improving messaging and 
data quality by reducing the chance of 
human error.

Looking forward 
Our performance in 2023 is a 
demonstration of resilience amidst 
challenging economic and market 
conditions. We will continue to drive 
forward our ambitious transformation 
programme as we create a more modern, 
digital and agile business. By staying 
focused on these priorities, I am confident 
that we can strengthen our position, 
creating a workplace community that 
is ideally positioned and committed to 
delivering for our customers, to ensure 
we are their preferred choice for air cargo 
transportation.

Strengthening our 
operations and innovating 
for the future

Business overview
During 2023, we significantly increased 
the resilience and operational efficiency 
of our IT systems, ensuring they were 
available when our customers needed 
them, which resulted in a more stable 
peak summer period than in 2022, 
with reduced incidents of disruption. 

We invested significantly in cybersecurity 
tooling and expertise to keep our data 
and IT estate secure. We continued to 
build for the future by further modernising 
our IT estate and remediating 
obsolescence, making steady progress 
with our migration to the cloud, moving 
toward completion in 2024. We increased 
our investment in IT transformation for 
our commercial platform and customer 
journey, as well as operations optimisation, 
and IT efficiencies and enablers. 

We also invested in our Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) capabilities, and data 
and analytics. We brought together a new 
IAG.ai team and launched a new London 
Lab to promote and strengthen our 
innovation and venture capital ambitions. 

Our people 
We continued to evolve our IT operating 
model to respond to changing business 
needs and new ways of working while 
continuing to deliver value for the 
Group. By using agile methodologies 
and product-led teams we can increase 
the pace of digital innovation and 
delivery for our customers.

We welcomed a new intake of graduates 
to our teams this year, while our cohort 
from 2022 continued to gain invaluable 
experience through their chosen postings. 
Our 2021 graduate cohort completed 
their programme, and we are proud that 
13 out of 14 of them found permanent 
roles within the Group. In addition, all 
our apprentices from 2021 completed 
their programmes and found roles in 
IAG Tech.

We recruited talent to further strengthen 
our teams and ensured we have the right 

capabilities to support our operations 
across the Group, particularly data 
scientists and engineers, welcoming 
114 new hires to IAG Tech.

In addition, we provided further training 
and development for our people, 
including support and coaching for 
maintaining personal resilience during 
peak operational periods.

None of the progress we made in 2023 
would have been possible without the 
commitment and professionalism of our 
people.

Our customers 
We made significant investments to 
further improve our airlines and Loyalty 
customer platforms with new 
functionality that delivers real value. 
For example:

•  we continuously reviewed and 

improved the cybersecurity controls 
we use to protect our data and 
infrastructure from cyberattack;

•  we are transforming our commercial 

platforms to provide better 
and customised offerings and 
experiences to our customers 
while also investing in operations 
optimisation and IT efficiencies 
and enablers; and

•  we continued to invest in our 
infrastructure to support fast, 
reliable, and secure services for 
our customers. 

We continued to refresh mobile devices 
across front and back-office 
employees to take further advantage 
of digitalisation and better support 
our operations and customers. 

Our planet
Our innovation teams continued 
to look for new ways to improve our 
environmental sustainability, partnering 
across the organisation on rapid 
prototyping, testing and scaling up 
successful solutions that can provide 
the biggest impact. Our Hangar 51 
Ventures team completed several 

transactions with start-ups developing 
new technologies for Sustainable 
Aviation Fuel (SAF), hydrogen-powered 
vehicles and airport operations to 
reduce waste.

With the development of our Group-
wide data and analytics capabilities, 
we are equipping business decision-
makers with tools and insights on flight 
efficiency and maintenance optimisation 
to enable emissions reduction. 

We have committed to using AI in an 
ethical and sustainable way, with active 
governance to ensure we adhere to 
these principles. Our aim is to become 
an industry leader in responsible AI to 
increase productivity, transform customer 
experience, streamline operations and 
remove manual toil. Through AI, we want 
people to be valued for their curiosity 
and creativity, and not for their ability 
to mimic robots.

We continue to look at ways to reduce 
the carbon footprint and energy costs 
of our IT estate, including through the 
decommissioning of legacy systems and 
migration to the cloud.

Looking forward 
We will continue to invest in cybersecurity 
to build on the work already done and 
keep pace with the evolving cyber 
threats we face. As we continue to 
remove obsolescence, we will increase 
our investment in transformation over 
the next few years. We will mature our 
AI and automation capabilities and use 
data and analytics to deliver insights 
that will better support all areas of our 
business, accelerate innovation and 
improve fact-based decision making. 
Powered by Venture Capital investment, 
our technology and innovation will push 
current boundaries in sustainability, 
automation and customer experience.

We listen to our customers, and we 
continue to enrich and improve the 
on-board experience through brand 
new entertainment content such 
as wellbeing, mindfulness and yoga. 
In addition, we improved our WiFi 
connection system, which now provides 
a free messaging service to all our 
passengers. In 2023 we have renewed 
our menu offering which includes nods 
to the local gastronomy of all the 
destinations to which we operate. 
In 2023, almost 45% of our passengers 
used this platform and two out of three 
people who had a meal included in 
their flight personalised their menu.

Our planet
We deploy technology to further 
our efficiency and contribute to our 
sustainability objectives. Personalisation 
allows us to optimise the cargo on-
board, reducing not only the weight and 
waste generated, but also food waste. 
We recalculate fuel needs 30 minutes 
before each flight’s departure based 
on the final load of the aircraft and 
an updated weather forecast, which 
has led to a reduction of 3% of our CO2 
emissions, which represents a 9.8% 
improvement compared to the target 
initially planned for 2023.

Looking forward
LEVEL has initiated the procedures 
to obtain its own Air Operator 
Certificate (AOC) and a fleet expansion 
plan that envisions reaching up to eight 
aircraft by 2026. We will continue to 
stimulate growth through the 
strengthening and expansion of our 
offering and through our number of 
destinations, to consolidate our 
leadership in Barcelona. And with all of 
this, LEVEL will continue to give support 
and to promote alliances with strategic 
partnerships in Barcelona, our centre of 
operations, to continue exporting the 
talent of the city.

Growing our long-
haul proposition 
in Barcelona

“We continue growing 
as a company and 
making Barcelona’s 
intercontinental 
connectivity stronger. 
Our commitment has 
allowed us to become 
the leading long-haul 
airline in Barcelona.”

Fernando Candela
Chief Executive Officer of LEVEL

Business overview
In 2023, LEVEL was the leading 
long-haul airline at the Josep Tarradellas 
Barcelona – El Prat Airport. This 
confirms our strong commitment to 
the development of Barcelona’s airport 
as a hub and the strengthening of the 
intercontinental connectivity through 
the sustained growth of our routes, 
which connect Barcelona to the 
Americas without stopovers. We 
increased our capacity by 33.1% versus 
the previous year, which is equivalent to 
an extra 183,000 seats. This increase in 
capacity has also been possible thanks 
to the addition of a fifth aircraft to our 
fleet. 

During 2023, we carried 40.5% more 
customers than in 2022, with an average 
punctuality within 15 minutes of 87.3%. 
LEVEL provided more than a quarter of 
the seats between Barcelona and the US 
and almost half of the seats to South 
America. We are the only operator 
in the market in five of the six 
destinations to which we fly.

Our people 
On our sixth anniversary in June 2023, 
we launched our new uniforms. The 
project was a collaborative effort across 
all areas, including LEVEL’s crew, in 
partnership with the Barcelona School 
of Design, as a sign of our commitment 
to Barcelona. The uniforms are entirely 
manufactured locally. The result reflects 
the airline’s value proposition ‘Fly your 
Way’, that provides a tailor-made 
experience according to every 
customer’s needs. Once again, LEVEL 
demonstrates that the commitment 
of its team is at the heart of all 
its decisions.

Leading our industry in SAF projects 

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

Supporting advanced SAF pathways

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are chemically almost 
identical to kerosene. 

The feedstocks for these fuels – currently waste materials such 
as municipal waste or waste wood – absorb CO2 in their growth 
cycle before this carbon is recycled into fuel and then emitted 
during the flight. 

There are eight certified pathways to making SAF based on 
use of specific technologies and feedstocks. These processes 
are certified to international standards to ensure the fuels are 
safe to use. SAF can be used in existing aircraft and airport 
fuelling infrastructure. 

IAG also ensures its SAF complies with strict sustainability 
certification schemes, to ensure the feedstocks come from 
sustainable sources, and that the production processes 
conserve water and energy and have minimal wider impacts.

IAG continues to make direct investments in new and innovative 
SAF production capacity, catalysing the wider development of 
the SAF market. These investments are typically coupled with 
SAF purchase agreements, which are critical to the financial 
viability of the new SAF production capacity.

The Group uplifts jet fuel in multiple locations, including the US 
and Europe, and therefore is exploring projects in multiple regions. 

IAG is working with technology developers to establish a range 
of SAF supply options, including the projects listed in this section. 
We aim to be a leader in supporting developed SAF production 
pathways that achieve the greatest life-cycle emission reductions 
and can accelerate our efforts to decarbonise. 

In February 2024, IAG signed its largest-ever SAF purchase 
agreement with Twelve, a SAF project based in Washington, 
which produces advanced power-to-liquid SAF made from CO2, 
water and renewable energy. This means we have secured 
one-third of the SAF required to meet IAG’s 10% SAF by 2030 
target.

For SAF produced from other pathways, the Group is also 
working to support projects which remove carbon or capture 
and store it.

Delivering on our commitment

Role in IAG transition plan 

As of 31 December 2023, our total investment in SAF reached 
$1 billion, of which 86% is future commitments.1 This is the 
largest disclosed commitment to SAF by any airline globally.

In 2023, Group airlines used more than 53,000 tonnes of SAF, 
an increase of 417% versus 2022, and one of the highest 
volumes globally. This saved around 157.1 ktCO2, accounting 
for 0.6% of emission reductions.

IAG remains on track to deliver a 100-fold increase in its SAF 
volumes between 2022 and 2030, and expects to use SAF 
for 70% of total fuel in 2050.

SAF is a key solution in IAG’s transition plan to net zero 
(Section A.1.2.). It reduces carbon emissions on a greenhouse 
gas lifecycle basis, typically by 80% or more compared with the 
fossil jet fuels it replaces.

In 2021, the Group set a target of using one million tonnes 
of SAF a year by 2030, dependent on appropriate government 
policy support.

Advocating for appropriate SAF policy 
IAG recognises that policies designed to support the development of SAF globally are currently fragmented and take different 
forms. The Group is therefore working closely with policymakers and industry to support the development of appropriate SAF 
policies needed to provide a strong investment signal and to scale up supply to meet sector demands. 

We welcome the decision made by ICAO and its Member States at the third ICAO Conference on Aviation Alternative Fuels 
(CAAF/3), to strive to achieve a global aspirational vision to reduce CO2 emissions in international aviation by 5% by 2030 through 
the use of SAF, low-carbon alternative fuels (LCAF) and other aviation clean energies.

In key markets, such as the US, EU and UK, our policy advocacy has focused in 2023 on the following areas below. 

US

Policy overview

EU

Policy overview

UK

Policy overview

SAF supply is currently incentivised in the 
US under state-level programmes, which 
offer producers tax credits for their 
production. These programmes currently 
operate in states such as California, Illinois, 
Minnesota, Washington and Oregon. 

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed in 
August 2022, also provides federal tax 
credits for SAF producers (for SAF 
dispensed in the US). 

IAG 2023 activity

IAG continues to explore and sign 
purchase agreements for SAF from 
projects in the US which will be eligible 
to claim tax credit incentives. Please 
see our key SAF partnerships table 
for more details. 

The UK has set a SAF target of 10% by 
2030, and a target to commence the 
construction of five SAF plants by 2025. 
In 2023, following advocacy efforts by 
industry, the UK Government agreed 
to develop a revenue certainty mechanism 
for SAF producers, that should be in 
force by 2026.

Under the UK ETS, SAF is zero-emission 
rated, but there currently is no incentive 
comparable with policy provided under 
the EU ETS. 

IAG 2023 activity

IAG responded to the UK’s consultation 
on its SAF mandate in 2023. We continue 
to engage with policymakers on ways 
to incentivise SAF use in the UK, 
including the UK ETS.

As a member of the Jet Zero Council, IAG 
has engaged with the UK Government and 
supported industry calls for a revenue 
certainty mechanism for UK SAF 
producers. We continue to engage through 
the Jet Zero Council to support the 
development of this mechanism as 
quickly as practicable, to accelerate 
SAF production in the UK.

IAG also engages with Heathrow airport 
on its financial incentive scheme to support 
SAF uplift.

The EU has legislated under its Fit for 
55 package a new ReFuelEU policy 
that will set a SAF mandate from 2025. 
The mandate will require a minimum 
volume of SAF in the EU, starting in 2025 
at 2% and reaching 6% by 2030, 
with 1.2% of the 2030 volume to be met 
through use of advanced SAF pathways, 
such as Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF.

Also within the Fit for 55 package, 
the EU has agreed to amend the Emissions 
Trading System (ETS) Directive, and 
introduce an incentive for aircraft 
operators to increase SAF uplift through 
the EU ETS from 2024. This will make 
it possible for aircraft operators to claim 
a share of 20 million allowances set aside 
by the European Commission to cover 
some of the difference in the price paid for 
SAF compared to jet kerosene, on EU ETS 
compliant routes. SAF continues to be 
zero-emission rated under the EU ETS, 
which also incentivises use by aircraft 
operators to reduce annual carbon cost 
exposure.

IAG 2023 activity

We support the legislative changes made 
by the EU to support the development 
of SAF supply in Europe. 

We are now engaging with policymakers 
on technical details concerning the 
monitoring, reporting and verification 
(MRV) of SAF use, alignment of new 
legislative requirements with existing EU 
ETS reporting frameworks and geographic 
scope. We have also responded to public 
consultations on the implementation of 
these policies in Member States. 

SAF governance in IAG
SAF is a key solution in IAG’s transition plan to net zero emissions. In 2023, IAG enhanced its governance framework suitable 
for accelerating our engagement with SAF investments and policy. This included establishing a SAF Management Group, comprised 
of colleagues from IAG sustainability, Group finance and each operating company. The SAF Management Group reports to the SAF 
Steering Group. Please refer to ‘Principles of sustainability governance’ for more information.

Supporting emissions reductions for our customers
IAG offers corporate customers the opportunity to purchase the emission reductions from SAF to support their own Scope 3 
emission reductions. In total, Group airlines sold more than 150,000 tonnes of CO2 to customers last year. IAG also allocated around 
150 tonnes CO2 towards internal activities, including emissions associated with travel to senior leadership conferences.

A.1.2. Transition plan 
Overview
IAG is targeting net zero emissions 
by 2050 across its Scope 1, 2 
and 3 emissions. 

‘Net zero’ means any residual emissions 
from IAG operations in 2050, or by the 
manufacture and transport of goods 
supplied to the Group, will be mitigated 
by an equivalent amount of CO2 removed 
from the atmosphere via carbon removals. 

IAG is on track to deliver its 2025, 2030 
and 2050 climate targets (see below) 
by carrying out emission-reduction 
initiatives, working in collaboration 
with key stakeholders and proactively 
advocating for supportive government 
policy and technology development. 

Latest IAG roadmap to net zero 
million tonnes CO2 (MT)

IAG is also driving internal action by 
using climate-related annual incentives 
for over 7,500 senior executives 
and managers.

Key measures to reduce emissions are 
fleet modernisation, SAF usage, market-
based measures, including the UK and 
EU ETS and CORSIA, and carbon 
removals. 

Less than 10% of the emissions 
reductions between 2019 and 2050 
are expected to come from offsets.

Roadmap to net zero
IAG was the first airline group in the world 
to commit to net zero emissions, and has 
been publishing updates to its roadmap 
to this goal every year since 2019. 

The version below is a core Group 
scenario which assumes continued 
policy support for aviation 
decarbonisation, an overall recovery 
to 2019 levels of passenger demand 
by 2024 and annual demand growth 
aligned with the long-term growth 
forecasts disclosed in notes 4 and 17 of 
the financial statements.

Changes to our roadmap in 2023 focus 
on increasing the use of SAF in our 
operations in the short term, and our 
investment in carbon removals before 
2030. Beyond 2030, it maintains an 
assumption that hydrogen aircraft will 
be introduced to the fleet from 2040, 
and a 5% emissions saving from airspace 
modernisation will be achieved by 2050.

Carbon removals

Introduction

Carbon removal solutions extract CO2 already in the 
atmosphere and store it in biological or geological ways. 

Examples of carbon removal include:

•  Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) – include creating new forests 

and peatland;

•  BioEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) – capturing 
biogenic carbon from industrial facilities and storing it in, e.g. 
underground aquifers;

•  Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) with SAF production – as 
above and including the use of byproducts which can absorb 
CO2; and

•  Direct Air Capture (DAC) – absorbing CO2 directly from the 

air using a catalyst.

IAG sees carbon avoidance projects as a key transitional 
solution en route to full use of removals. Carbon removal 
projects differ from carbon avoidance projects, which prevent 
the future release of CO2. 

Role in IAG transition plan

Group airlines have offered customers the opportunity to make 
a financial contribution to support carbon removals projects 
since 2022. British Airways customers have supported removals 
projects including mangrove restoration in Pakistan and a 
biochar project in Oregon, USA. 

By 2050, IAG will only use carbon removals to mitigate any 
residual emissions from its operations. 

IAG will only work with suppliers who do the same, as part of 
meeting the Group’s Scope 3 commitment. IAG is already 
encouraging suppliers to transition from offsets to removals as 
part of a new supplier contract clause which is being rolled out 
across its supply chain.

IAG supports the inclusion of carbon 
removals in industry decarbonisation 
pathways, and in external assessments 
of support for the 1.5°C global ambition.

IAG’s short- and long-term targets have 
been independently assessed by the 
Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) 
as 1.5°C-aligned and its mid-term target 
assessed as well-below-2°C-aligned. The 
TPI assessment compared the 
milestones in the 2021 IAG roadmap 
with an industry-wide pathway modelled 
by the International Energy Agency 
(IEA), taking removals commitments 
into account.

IAG began investing in ZeroAvia in 
2020, a leading developer of 
hydrogen-electric, zero-emission 
aviation. IAG increased its 
investment in 2022, to advance 
ZeroAvia's 2-5 MW hydrogen-
electric powertrain development 
programme.

Advocacy for carbon removal policy

IAG expects to use carbon removals to meet an increasing share 
of its CORSIA obligations between 2024 and 2035, conditional on 
appropriate policy, and supports wider guidance on how 
to transition to removals such as the Oxford Offsetting Principles. 

The Group continues to advocate for policies that will accelerate 
global uptake of carbon removals, via the Coalition for Negative 
Emissions and other trade associations listed in A.1.7., and 
supports the inclusion of removals in the EU, Swiss and UK ETS.

Investing in carbon removals

IAG is committed to supporting a variety of innovative carbon 
removals solutions and is considering projects that are 
immediately available and independently verified today, as well 
as more innovative technology solutions. 

Our investment in Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) technologies 
involves a combination of forward delivery procurement and 
project financial support, facilitating the scale-up of GGR 
technologies alongside relevant government support.

When IAG or its operating companies choose to voluntarily 
invest in carbon avoidance and removal projects, they work in 
collaboration with key partners, carry out due diligence to 
select reputable providers and select projects carefully to meet 
and align with verified quality standards, such as Gold Standard, 
Puro Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).

In 2023, British Airways worked in partnership with CUR8 (a 
UK-based company dedicated to building the global market for 
carbon removals), UNDO (a world-leading carbon dioxide 
removal project developer specialising in enhanced rock 
weathering), and Standard Chartered, representing financial 
institutions, to launch a first-of-a-kind financing pilot designed 
to help scale-up the carbon removals market. 

The pilot aims to support the scale-up of the carbon removals 
market by creating a blueprint to enable carbon removal 
suppliers to access capital in the form of debt financing via 
advanced purchase agreements. British Airways has committed 
to purchase more than 4,000 tonnes of carbon removal credits 
delivered by UNDO through enhanced rock weathering, and 
Standard Chartered is looking to be the banking partner.

Carbon removals within our 2050 roadmap 
MT CO2

Based on the latest roadmap, the Group expects to use approximately 100 MT of carbon removals between 2022 and 2050 
to mitigate Scope 1 emissions and could potentially be removing 2 MT annually in 2030, conditional on clear and globally 
agreed verification and quality standards for removals, inclusion of removals in ETS schemes, and stable policy support.

Key carbon removal projects

Freres Biochar project
The Freres Biochar project in Oregon, USA, 
involves a biomass power production plant that 
produces biochar, a carbon-rich, charcoal-like 
material that is created when agricultural and 
wood waste is used as fuel. The process feeds 
carbon into the soil and prevents it from 
naturally decaying, locking carbon away and 
keeping it out of the atmosphere for several 
hundred years.

Blue Carbon Mangrove project
The Blue Carbon Mangrove project in the 
Indus Delta area in Pakistan is a nature-based 
carbon removal project (where plants absorb 
carbon from the atmosphere through 
photosynthesis). The project will support 
greenhouse gas removal by reforestation 
and revegetation of approximately 
225,000 hectares of degraded tidal wetlands 
with mangrove and other species to absorb 
carbon dioxide, stabilise the area and protect 
the coastal area and communities.

Overview
IAG’s transition plan focuses on reducing 
CO2 from jet fuel use, as this represents 
over 99% of Scope 1 emissions. 

The Group measures its full carbon 
footprint and tracks multiple metrics 
each quarter to ensure progress 
on tackling climate change. 

2023 saw strong progress against 
the key metric of carbon efficiency. 

With a 3.6% annual improvement to 80.5 
gCO2/pkm, the Group is on track to 
deliver our carbon efficiency target of 
80.0 gCO2/pkm by 2025, accounting 
for emissions reductions achieved 
from SAF. 

Calculation methodology
Emissions are calculated by multiplying 
fuel and energy use by appropriate 
conversion factors that are aligned 
with the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth 
Assessment Report. 2023 UK 
Government conversion factors are 
applied across the Group as these are 
deemed to be the most robust available. 
Other factors such as International 
Energy Agency emissions factors are 
used in specific cases as described in the 
IAG statement of non-financial 
information.

Our carbon intensity calculation includes 
CO2 emission reductions achieved from 
SAF. SAF reductions are calculated 
using actual life cycle analysis (LCA) 
carbon intensity values for SAF fuel 
uplifted by airlines in the Group, and 
subtracting the achieved emission 
reductions from our total CO2 footprint. 

IAG discloses methane (CH4) and nitrous 
oxide (N2O) as Scope 1 non-CO2 
greenhouse gases (GHGs), in line 
with the UK conversion factors. 

In 2023, emissions of CH4 were 18,009 
tonnes and N2O were 216,542 tonnes.

A detailed Scope 3 emissions 
breakdown is available in the IAG 
statement of non-financial information.

used is 4,386 million, which excludes cargo carried on other airlines or trucks. The jet fuel used excludes fuel for franchises and engine testing.

3  2020 emissions were below the EU ETS sector cap for aviation so no net reductions were delivered.
4  For completeness, Scope 2 emissions cover electricity use at airports and overseas offices, which are partly outside IAG’s operational control.

As part of complying with the UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting regulation, 58% of Group energy use was UK energy use, based on Scope 
1 emissions and Group electricity use in UK-based offices, up from 56% in 2022.

Scope 3 emissions calculations
IAG Scope 3 emissions accounted for approximately 20% of total emissions in 2023. Our target is to achieve a 20% drop in net 
Scope 3 emissions compared to the 2019 baseline, from 8.3 MT to 6.6 MT by 2030. In 2023 IAG Scope 3 emissions were 6.5 million 
tonnes CO2e.

IAG GBS operates a supply chain sustainability programme which includes ESG scorecards and supplier risk screening. 

In 2023, IAG GBS ran a proof-of-concept trial with Watershed to improve Scope 3.1 emissions reporting across the Group. In 
previous measurements, IAG reported Scope 3.1 emissions based on emissions calculated from water usage only. Under the trial with 
Watershed, a spend-based methodology for Scope 3.1 emissions was applied, combining IAG GBS supply chain spend data with 
Watershed’s emissions database. This improved reporting accuracy as emissions factors could be associated with the location and 
business activities of each supplier, including supplier-specific emission factors for those with CDP disclosures. The results of this trial 
are provided alongside previous emissions data captured in our Scope 3 emissions submission. 

IAG is expanding this research across our Scope 3 activities in 2024, to improve our data collection across all Scope 3 emission categories.

Carbon footprint calculation methodologies
The Group’s airlines offer passengers the ability to calculate their emissions footprint associated with their flights. This emissions 
footprint is estimated using a carbon calculator, which determines a volume of CO2 emissions that an aircraft emits per passenger 
over a defined flight route and cabin.

Additionally, some airlines offer customers the opportunity to offset or mitigate part of their emissions through investing in carbon 
removals projects and/or SAF.

IAG continues to develop the carbon calculation methodology that underpins our passenger emission calculators used by the Group, 
and advocates for an industry-wide standard that provides transparency and simplicity for customers. 

Key developments in 2023 include:

•  Aer Lingus continues its partnership with charity Pure Leapfrog to help passengers contribute towards mitigating some of the 

emissions generated from their flights;

•  British Airways continues to collaborate with the CHOOOSE platform that enables customers to understand their flight emissions 
and take steps to address their climate impact before or after their journey, or directly from their seat on board. This includes 
carbon removals from the ‘case study’ projects listed in section A.1.2.;

•  Iberia has certified its carbon footprint calculator methodology with AENOR (third-party verification entity); and
•  Vueling offers its customers the opportunity to make a contribution to the supply of SAF. Vueling matches its customers’ 

contributions, doubling the amount of SAF supplied. Almost 197,000 passengers have contributed 246 tonnes of SAF purchased 
since the initiative started in 2022. Passengers can also mitigate flight emissions by contributing towards the purchase of carbon 
removals though the collaboration with CHOOOSE. 

Non-CO2 effects 
IAG is supporting the ongoing research and development of mitigations for the non-CO2 effects of aviation. This includes 
participating in the UK Jet Zero Council’s non-CO2 working group, and supporting research by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI).

The Group’s airlines already participate in several non-CO2 research projects.

•  British Airways and Iberia are collaborating with Breakthrough Energy to identify which of our flights’ trajectories pass through 

Ice Super-Saturated Regions (ISSR) and may contribute to non-CO2 climate effects; 

•  Iberia participates in the IAGOS* project, which combines the knowledge of scientific institutions with the civil aviation 

operations to obtain essential data on atmosphere and air quality conditions for the subsequent development of more accurate 
climate models. New IAGOS equipment has been installed in an Airbus A330-200 which mainly operates routes across the 
Atlantic, providing atmospheric data from a valuable climate region;

•  Vueling completed several trials with SATAVIA** that aimed to reduce the creation of contrails and measure the improvements 

from adjustments made in-flight; and

•  Group airlines are also preparing to monitor, report and verify non-CO2 emissions for their future obligations under the EU ETS 

from 2025.

IAG advocates for further scientific research to support effective policy-making that can deliver true emission reductions.

A.1.4. Emissions reduction initiatives
Relevant standards: TR-AL-110a2. GRI 305-5.
Reducing gross and net emissions is a collective effort across the Group. Examples are provided throughout this report.

By 2030, fleet renewal and SAF programmes will have the biggest impact on reducing gross emissions, and CORSIA will have the 
biggest impact on reducing net emissions. In addition, other specific initiatives are run within operating airlines.

Our savings from key initiatives in 2023, rounded to the nearest 1,000 tonnes, are shown in the table below. See section ‘Leading our

Aer Lingus took its first new Airbus A320 aircraft delivery flight with 50% Sustainable Aviation 
Fuel onboard. 2023 also saw Aer Lingus procure SAF for the first time at London Heathrow as 
part of the Group deal with Phillips 66.

More efficient alternate routings. This change means that one-third of Aer Lingus flights can 
carry 160kg less fuel, reducing daily CO2 emissions by 3.2 tonnes.
British Airways was the first airline in the world to use SAF produced on a commercial scale in 
the UK after signing a multi-year agreement with Phillips 66.

British Airways took delivery of 10 new aircraft into the fleet, whilst retiring some of its older 
aircraft, which continues to help increase CO2 efficiency.
Sustainability is now integrated into annual pilot simulator checks with training rolled out across 
all fleets and a sustainability update issued to all flight crew.

IAG Cargo allows customers to purchase Scope 3 emission reductions from SAF production to 
support their own emissions reductions. In 2023, customers including Bolloré Logistics, DB 
Schenker, DHL Global Forwarding and Kuehne + Nagel engaged with this programme.

IAG GBS continues to partner with other companies through the ‘Business vs Smog’ programme 
to leverage its resources to help the fight against climate change. During the five years that GBS 
has been involved, programme volunteers have run 2,000 free workshops for 45,000 
participants in 150 towns.

British Airways Executive Club members can use their Avios to contribute towards the purchase 
of SAF on short-haul flights via the High Life Café.
Migration of IT services to Amazon cloud servers, saving energy and reducing CO2.
Iberia continues to deliver efficiency initiatives across the whole flight phase including take-off, 
cruise, approach and landing.
Iberia welcomed six new Airbus A350-900, which increase CO2 efficiency and reduce carbon 
emissions by around 65,000 tCO2e compared to 2022.
Vueling took delivery of four Airbus A321neos, increasing carbon efficiency by 20% by saving 
fuel and having a higher passenger capacity than the aircraft they replace.

Vueling is working with EUROCONTROL and ENAIRE to define a new KPI that measures the 
airspace efficiency according to CO2 emissions instead of distance flown. This will support 
changes within European airspace and promote optimal trajectories that reduce CO2 emissions.
Vueling was the first European LCC to partner with WheelTug, to accelerate the development of 
its device that will allow minimising engine use on the ground, reducing emissions and noise.

Fuel efficiency programme
As part of the IAG sustainability 
commitment, each Group airline has 
a fuel efficiency programme which 
supports flight planning and enables 
pilots to increase fuel efficiency. 
Best practices are shared across the 
Group to leverage synergies and further 
increase fuel efficiency.

2023 examples include:

•  British Airways and Vueling deployed 
NAVlink Wind Updates services in 
their A320 fleets. NAVlink provides 
optimised in-flight wind data updates, 
allowing pilots to plan a more efficient 
descent trajectory. NAVlink has 
proven to reduce around 22kg of CO2 
emissions per descent. This 
partnership was developed with the 
support of Hangar 51 – IAG’s 
innovation team;

•  Group airlines collaborated with 

Honeywell for the use of its Forge 
software. This software uses in-flight 
data to improve flight planning and 
increase fuel efficiency; and

•  Vueling has implemented the ‘Pilot 

App’ which provides transparent data 
on individual pilots' contribution 
towards sustainability goals. This app 
tracks the CO2 emissions saved during 
each flight, enhancing decision-
making in their day-to-day duties. 

A.1.5. Scenario analysis 
Overview
In 2023, IAG carried out multiple 
and aligned forms of scenario analysis:

•  the IAG Sustainability team and the 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
team reviewed all climate-related 
risks and opportunities and potential 
impacts to 2026 and 2030. 
The impacts of material risks are 
quantified as part of the Company-
wide ERM process which receives 
Board oversight;

•  operating airlines modelled 

compliance-related costs, including 
from the UK and EU ETS and CORSIA, 
to 2050;

•  TCFD-aligned scenario analysis was 
repeated using a dual timeframe 
of 2030 and 2050; and

•  ongoing analysis was carried out 

on the Flightpath Net Zero strategy 
to 2050. 

This scenario work informs strategy, 
planning, risk management and financial 
management.

IAG takes a proactive approach to 
managing climate-related risks and 
opportunities, and is committed to 
managing their regulatory, reputational, 
financial, market and technology aspects.

Applying carbon prices 
IAG concurrently applies carbon prices 
to financial planning and to future 
scenario analysis. 

The Fleet team uses updated carbon 
prices and price forecasts for short-haul 
and long-haul fleet purchasing decisions, 
based on market values and reputable 
external sources. The Group airlines use 
carbon prices in financial planning, and 
flight operations teams and pilots use 
carbon prices in operational decisions 
about fuel uptake.

Potential acquisitions include an 
assessment of exposure to climate-
related issues and policy.

For the period 2024 to 2033, UK ETS 
prices of £55 – £89/tonne, EU ETS 
prices of €84 – €124/tonne and CORSIA 
prices of $11 – $25/tonne were used for 
modelling compliance costs. 

EU and UK ETS prices are based on 
market prices and the UK Department 
for Transport (DfT) Aviation Forecast, 
and CORSIA prices are based on internal 
analysis and ICAO industry price forecasts. 

TCFD-aligned scenario analysis 
Since 2018 IAG has been incorporating 
the TCFD recommended guidance on 
climate risk disclosures. In 2023, IAG 
repeated a TCFD-aligned scenario 
analysis exercise, building on previous 
years’ exercises.

This was a structured, qualitative 
discussion of potential climate-related 
impacts and business responses, using 
the latest evidence and analysis from 
reputable sources like the UN, 
EUROCONTROL and Climate Action 
Tracker (CAT). IAG conducted its 2023 
analysis in line with the latest TCFD 
guidance update published in 2021. 

Temperature scenarios of 1.5°C1 were 
chosen for transitional risks, in 
recognition of IAG and global targets. 
The 2°C and 3°C warming scenarios 
were chosen for physical risks, based on 
the latest UN projections. 

The year 2030 was chosen as the key 
timeframe, based on IAG targets and 
key policy timelines, e.g. for SAF 
mandates. The year 2040 was also 
considered due to the possibility of the 
world overshooting 1.5°C in the 2030s 
leading to faster societal changes.

IAG exercises involved representatives 
from multiple teams including Strategy, 
Treasury, Finance, Government Affairs, 
Commercial Planning, Investor Relations, 
People, Enterprise Risk Management, 
IAG Tech, IAG GBS, IAG Loyalty and 
sustainability representatives from 
all operating airlines. The Group 
Sustainability team collated inputs, 
which were reviewed by the IAG 
Sustainability Steering Group and the 
Safety, Environment and Corporate 
Responsibility (SECR) Committee. 

The Group remains resilient to the most 
material climate-related impacts – 
industry-wide policy shifts – and these 
have been quantified and mitigation 
plans embedded into financial and 
strategic planning. Industry-wide 
changes also create opportunities for 
the Group to become more resilient than 
its competitors.

To address significant uncertainty 
around future policy, technology and 
market trends, IAG is repeating this 
scenario analysis annually. We will keep 
implementing action plans in coming 
years to further improve resilience 
to wider changes.

1  ‘Orderly’ and ‘Disorderly’ scenarios were chosen as per TCFD definitions. These scenarios 

compare smooth, predictable and idealised climate-related changes with abrupt, variable and 
disjointed changes across regions.

A.1.6. Risks and opportunities 
Climate-related risks are assessed and 
managed within the ERM framework as 
described in Section C.6. and in the Risk 
management and principal risks factors 
section under the principal risk 
‘Sustainable aviation’. Opportunities are 
managed within relevant teams.

Transitional risks primarily affect airline 
activity between European destinations, 
which contributed to 34% of flying 
activity in 2023. Physical risks could 
affect IAG operations across its global 
network, reflecting the global nature of 
climate change. 

IAG considers the relevant risk factors 
that could impact each risk by region 
and timescale. Such variability may arise 
from fragmented policy definition, scope 
and implementation, changeable market 
perceptions, or unpredictable delivery of 
new technology (among other causes). 
IAG considers its mitigation strategy for 
each risk accordingly. Please refer to the 
‘Risk impacts and mitigation’ table for 
more information.

The carbon-reduction targets in the 
Flightpath Net Zero strategy are the key 
measures for assessing the mitigation of 

these risks, along with the consideration 
of these risks in relevant governance 
processes. The external risk 
environment, materiality of risks, 
mitigation actions and KPIs for these 
mitigating actions are reviewed 
regularly. 

The table below lists risks assessed 
through the ERM process. The most 
material risks are policy risks. Risk 
timeframes align with corporate 
planning timelines.

1  Risks might be increasing (up), decreasing (down) or stabilising from a business perspective. IAG calculates this based on central strategy modelling 

and economic forecasting, and the risk trend shown is based on an end-of-year assessment, relative to in-year review.

2  Whether the cost impacts depend more on the temperature scenario (2°C or 3°C), or type of transition (Orderly or Disorderly).
3  Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP), a globally recognised scenario for physical changes under different temperature ranges.
4  A 41% drop by 2030 represents an Orderly transition. A 27% drop represents a Disorderly transition because smaller global emissions reductions 

to 2030 require rapid decarbonisation after 2030 to return to 1.5°C by 2100.

Risk impacts and mitigation

Description as per previous page

Potential unmitigated financial impacts

How IAG is mitigating

Physical
Resilience to acute 
weather events

Days of lost revenue due to additional 
flight disruption and associated mitigation 
and passenger compensation costs

Existing operational resilience processes 
can minimise extra disruption (for example 
from more turbulence from US-UK flights)

Resilience of routes and 
assets to chronic climate 
changes

Changed revenue from a different route network 
or a different frequency of flights to climate-
affected destinations, changes in operational 
maintenance costs

Market
Customer spend due to 
perceptions of ESG progress 
in IAG or the aviation sector 

Customers change frequency of flying, duration 
of trips, or spend less relative to other carriers 
or other travel modes

Scale of route network means impacts above 
plan are not material so no immediate action 
needed. Aircraft are mobile assets which can be 
moved to different locations to account for e.g. 
more hurricanes in the Caribbean

Delivering emissions reductions, developing 
emissions dashboards for customers, 
expanding customer communications, support 
for global instruments like CORSIA, working via 
trade associations to advance solutions

Perceived quality of offset 
and removal projects

Supply chain readiness

SAF delivery against 
committed offtake 
agreements

Policy
Litigation against claimed 
carbon reductions from 
offsetting

Demand impact of EU 
and UK climate policy

Resilience to changes in 
CORSIA/ETS pricing

Policy asymmetry across 
regions

Extra regulation on activity 
rather than emissions

Exposure to sudden variability in prices, cost of 
CORSIA credits, scale of growth in costs by 2050 
due to available volume of removals to deliver 
net zero

Strategy to avoid price spikes, governance 
to ensure offset quality, a removals roadmap 
based on external evidence, advocacy 
for policy support and monitoring regimes

Sustainability compliance or technology change 
causing unplanned changes in cost of goods and 
services provided to IAG or associated supplier 
management costs, margin erosion 

Supply chain sustainability programme 
which includes ESG scorecards and supplier 
risk screening

SAF delivery from agreed commitments fail to 
materialise from weak market supply or failed 
project development, exposing IAG to market 
priced SAF, buyout penalties or carbon costs

Securing SAF deals and taking equity in 
early-stage projects where relevant. Monitoring 
SAF project development and seeking volume 
above target levels

Litigation for use of credits towards voluntary or 
compliance offsetting that do not deliver claimed 
emission reductions leads to legal cost

Due diligence conducted on carbon offsetting 
projects, internal guidance prepared for 
external communications 

Pass-through of industry-wide costs affects ticket 
prices and, therefore, demand

Impacts of emerging policy assessed as part 
of longer-term financial planning and strategy

Exposure to long-term price increases affects 
compliance costs

Strategy to reduce impact of price spikes; using 
carbon prices in fleet and financial planning

Changing numbers of customers relative to other 
carriers who are under more favourable or more 
restrictive policy regimes

Industry-wide taxes or levies increase operating 
costs and have potential demand impacts; demand 
management measures equate to lost revenue. 
Noise restrictions are not included in this risk but 
are reviewed as a separate risk through the ERM 
framework 

Advocacy for global solutions such as the ICAO 
Long-Term Aspirational Goal agreed in 2022

Advocacy in support of emissions-reducing 
measures like SAF and against economically 
inefficient measures like taxes

Lack of supporting SAF 
infrastructure or policy

Higher prices of SAF in core markets due to lack of 
investment in SAF production or cost of inputs

Regulation on non-CO2 
effects

Potential multiplier on ETS costs, lost revenue due 
to route restrictions, or operational costs due to 
non-CO2 management

Advocacy for SAF policy, e.g. via UK Jet Zero 
Council, and a strategy to procure SAF in 
regions where supportive policy exists

External research suggests just 10% of flights 
could account for 80% of impacts. Advocacy 
via trade associations to support monitoring 
and targeted solutions such as route 
optimisation and SAF uptake

Risks associated with SAF
SAF is a key solution in IAG’s 
transition plan to net zero (Section 
A.1.2.), but remains a developing 
market, which in many regions is still 
awaiting policy definition to drive 
infrastructure investment. IATA 
projects SAF production will meet 
just 0.5% of global aviation fuel 
demand in 20241. IAG separates SAF 
risks into market, policy and 
technological risks associated with 
scaling up the global SAF industry. 
IAG considers the respective 
impacts on fulfilling IAG’s 2030 
commitments and future regulatory 
obligations, by modelling the impact 
of regional differences in future SAF 
supply and costs, associated with 
different policies (policy risk), SAF 
feedstock technologies (technology 
risk) and market prices (market 
risk). IAG uses this modelling to 
influence SAF strategy and 
investments.

A.1.7. Stakeholder engagement
Relevant standards: GRI 102-
13/43/44
Overview
The aviation industry will decarbonise 
faster with stakeholder and policy 
support.

The Group and its operating airlines 
regularly engage with key stakeholders: 
governments and regulators, shareholders, 
lenders and other financial stakeholders, 
trade associations, customers, suppliers, 
employees, communities, NGOs and 
academic institutions to advocate for 
support for emissions reductions and to 
share progress on Flightpath Net Zero.

Following our successful first IAG ESG 
day for investors in 2022, IAG delivered 
a sustainability update as part of its 
Capital Markets Day in November 2023.

Internal governance ensures that wider 
stakeholder engagement on climate 
change is consistent with material issues 
and environmental goals. 

Key stances on climate change
IAG supports cost-effective approaches 
to deliver net zero emissions by 2050, 
advance low-carbon solutions, and 
support global efforts to align with 1.5°C.

Actions within associations focused on 
UK aviation, Spanish aviation and global 
aviation policy are listed in the table 
opposite. If the climate-related positions 
of trade associations are deemed to be 
substantially weaker or inconsistent 
with these internal stances, IAG 
representatives take roles on task forces 
and working groups and respond 
to consultations to communicate 
our position and constructively move 
to alignment. 

IAG is proud to have consistent views on 
climate change with all the organisations 
of which it is a member (below). IAG has 
positively influenced this outcome by 
contributing expertise and time to drive 
net zero commitments, and create and 
support roadmaps to net zero emissions 
across SA, A4E, oneworld, JZC, and 
ATAG. IAG has also driven and 
encouraged higher SAF ambitions 
across the JZC, oneworld and WEF. IAG 
and key trade associations are listed on 
the EU Transparency Register. 

Key principles of climate-related 
engagement
Aviation is a global industry and IAG 
remains committed to global 
policy approaches. 

IAG supports carbon pricing as a key 
instrument to determine both the pace 
of emissions reductions for the aviation 
industry and the balance of in-sector 
and out-of-sector reductions. We 
advocate for the use of greenhouse gas 
emission removal technologies in carbon 
markets, by both natural and engineered 
means. By 2050 we are committed to 
using only GGRs to cover our residual 
carbon emissions. 

IAG prioritises policy advocacy on SAF 
too, as this is a key emissions reduction 
driver in the next decade, and supports 
policies on operational efficiency, 
zero-emission aircraft and carbon 
offsets and removals.

The Group seeks to ensure that policies 
delivered are effective and fair across 
multiple airlines.

Key engagement forums in the UK, Spain and Ireland

Ireland
In 2023, the Irish Government 
announced plans to establish 
a Government-Industry SAF forum 
to inform and guide its work on SAF.

IAG welcomed this announcement and 
Aer Lingus is continuing to engage at 
European level, and with the Irish 
Government on policy support to 
incentivise SAF production in Ireland.

Spain – Alianza para la Sostenibilidad 
del Transporte Aéreo en España
(Spanish Alliance for Sustainable Air 
Transport)
The Spanish Alliance for Sustainable 
Air Transport (AST) was launched in 
April 2023. The AST is a joint initiative 
comprising the air transport industry, 
academia, and NGOs to promote the 
development of sustainable aviation 
in Spain, favouring the implementation 
of new technologies and innovative 
processes that make the long-term 
sustainability of the sector possible, 
and boost pathways towards 
decarbonisation. Iberia played a key role 
in creating the AST, and both the Iberia 
and Vueling CEOs are members.

UK – Jet Zero Council
The UK Government’s Jet Zero Council 
(JZC) launched in 2021 as the first of 
its kind partnership between the aviation 
industry and Government. The JZC aims 
to provide advice on the Government’s 
ambitions to deliver net zero aviation 
and zero-emission flights. It brings 
together ministers and CEO-level 
stakeholders, with regular meetings 
and subgroups to drive the ambitious 
delivery of new technologies and 
innovation to cut aviation emissions. 
Through the success of the JZC, several 
countries have followed its example, 
including in Spain and Ireland.

In 2023 IAG supported the JZC’s 
focus on SAF. This included the UK 
Government’s second consultation on 
SAF, participation in the SAF mandate 
sub group and the commercialisation 
sub group, and supporting a revenue 
certainty mechanism for SAF, which 
the UK Government has now committed 
to through the UK Energy Bill. 

The Ninth Jet Zero Council focused 
on greenhouse gas removal technology, 
and BA showcased its nature-based 
carbon removal projects

A.2. Planet – wider issues

A.2.1. Waste
Relevant standards: GRI 306-1/2/3 
(2020).
Overview
IAG has one of the most comprehensive 
waste reduction plans in the airline 
industry. Our priorities include reducing 
food waste, and eliminating the use of 
single-use plastics, in addition to 
increasing recycling across our 
operations. 

On-board services are the main source 
of waste. Key waste outputs include 
plastic packaging, leftover food waste, 

drinks cans and cabin items such as 
wrappers. Key inputs included on-board 
meals and amenity kits supplied to 
passengers. 

In 2023, IAG operations generated:

•  52,699 tonnes overall (52,655 tonnes 

in 2022); comprised of

•  51,749 tonnes non-hazardous waste; 

and 

•  950 tonnes hazardous waste. 

We recovered or recycled 
7,650 tonnes (19%).

Waste is typically offloaded and 
processed at airports by third-party 
caterers, with some materials recovered 
on-site and other materials incinerated 
or sent to landfill. The majority of cabin 
and catering waste is processed at IAG’s 
hub airports – Barcelona, Dublin, London 
and Madrid – although the Group flies to 
over 200 airports worldwide. 

Below is the Group’s most 
comprehensive waste disclosure to date. 
Waste trends are stabilising with the 
return to normal operations following 
the COVID-19 pandemic and IAG 
remains committed towards delivering 
our 2025 goals.

Commentary on key metrics

Key metrics

Description

Overall waste

Includes waste from all streams – on-board, office, cargo and 
maintenance waste – and an extrapolation of waste processed 
at overseas airports, where waste destinations are not always 
reported by third parties.

Waste 
recycling and 
recovery

Includes re-use, downcycling, upcycling, composting and 
anaerobic digestion. Regulations, including International 
Catering Waste (ICW) regulations, limit the amount which 
can be recycled.

Single-use 
plastic (SUP)

Items made wholly or partly of plastic and are typically 
intended to be used just once or for a short period of time 
before they are thrown away. This aligns to the EU definition.

Waste/pax at 
hubs

On-board catering waste generated per passenger, including 
volumes later recycled and recovered.

Passenger numbers are based on those inbound and outbound 
passengers who have their waste processed at hub airports: 
Barcelona, Dublin, London Heathrow and Gatwick, and Madrid.

Commentary 

Waste volumes have increased less than 1% in 
2023. This is despite activity levels returning 
to pre-pandemic levels. Please refer to examples of 
waste reduction initiatives across the Group for 
more details.

Overall recycling/recovery rates are 19%. Recycling 
of maintenance and cargo waste has increased 
significantly owing to initiatives implemented in 
this section of the report. Onboard recycling has 
fallen year-on-year as operations recover to 
pre-pandemic levels. Office waste has not 
increased year-on-year, but initiatives launched in 
2023, such as new recycling bins at Waterside, are 
expected to deliver an increase in office waste 
recycling rates in 2024.

160 tonnes of SUP were reduced from initiatives 
such as using birchwood cutlery and replacing 
packaging on blankets. The IAG GBS Procurement 
team is evaluating alternatives to plastic as part 
of procurement processes.

Waste generation ratios per passenger have 
improved to pre-pandemic levels, and we are 
committed to meet our 2025 target (a 20% 
reduction compared to 2019 levels).

Detailed descriptions of all waste metrics are available in the Consolidated Statement of non-Financial Information. 

Reducing waste across our operations
IAG launched a ‘5 by 2025’ plan in 2021 that covers five waste streams and five business units, using 2019 figures as the baseline 
for our targets. The plan includes waste generation and recycling targets across on-board, office, cargo and maintenance waste 
and a zero-based approach to single-use plastic (SUP). IAG is committed to reducing, reusing and recycling waste and dealing with 
any hazardous waste in line with relevant national and international regulations.

2023 examples

Aer Lingus becomes the first airline to segregate and recycle on-board waste arriving on short-haul flights into 
Ireland.

British Airways British Airways offers a pre-ordering service for products from the on-board SpeedBird Cafe, to give passengers 

the choice of buying fresh and ambient products before departure. These services remove food waste from 
unpurchased short-haul economy cabin meals while maintaining customer choice. British Airways has a target 
to halve food waste volumes between 2019 and 2025. 

British Airways becomes the first airline to be certified to recycle into New York as part of the IATA Transatlantic 
trial. Regulated garbage restrictions in the US dictate that anything that has touched food waste on an international 
flight has to be disposed.

IAG Cargo

Colleagues from IAG Cargo’s graduate programme have helped develop and launch re-usable cups for any 
beverages purchased from our canteen at London Heathrow in September 2023. This has reduced single-use 
plastic cups across the hub by 41%.

IAG GBS

Iberia

Vueling

The graduate programme has also developed a prototype of a new luggage tag made from waste aluminium 
pallets, which will be made available for sale to customers. IAG Cargo is also exploring how this may be achieved 
using other materials that are difficult to recycle or re-use.

The office at Waterside has launched new bins across all floorplates, divided into either five or seven sections 
to allow for multiple waste streams to be collected and disposed of easily. The trial aims to improve waste 
segregation and increase recycling levels.

Iberia offers a Buy-Before-You-Fly service on short-haul flights and runs the Zero Cabin Waste project which aims 
to recycle on-board generated waste. Iberia segregated glass on-board for the first time in 2023.

Vueling replaced all on-board cabin trolleys in 2022 with lighter trolleys that allow the segregation of waste 
on-board. This helps ensure waste can be processed more easily, resulting in a higher share of waste recycled and 
a lower environmental impact. The lower weight of the trolleys also helps reduce CO2 emissions from aircraft 
operations, by up to 400 tCO2e annually.

A.2.2. Noise and air quality 
Relevant standards: GRI 305-7.
IAG has delivered a 14% reduction in noise per take-off and landing cycle (LTO) versus 2019, driven by fleet renewal. Noise per 
take-off has improved by 3% from 2022 levels owing to the use of newer, quieter aircraft and changes in the mix of short-haul and 
long-haul operations following the COVID-19 pandemic. IAG remains committed to reducing the impact of aircraft noise and air 
pollution on local communities near airports and supports innovation as a means of delivering this. Noise and air quality performance 
are monitored using national databases and global aircraft noise standards.

Group airlines continue operational practices to minimise noise impacts, such as the use of continuous descents. They engage with 
stakeholders such as community groups, regulators and industry partners to understand their concerns and participate in research 
and operational trials to identify and refine solutions.

Noise reduction targets
IAG is updating noise reduction targets as flying levels return to pre-pandemic levels. Iberia is continuously improving the KPIs 
related to noise levels, as the new fleet we are introducing has better noise certification levels than the previous aircraft. 

Detailed descriptions on all noise metrics are available in the IAG statement of non-financial information.

Risk and/or opportunity description and potential impact

Mitigating actions

Airport operators and regulators apply operational noise 
restrictions and charging regimes which may introduce additional 
costs or restrict airlines’ ability to operate, e.g. restrictions on 
night flights.

•  Investing in new, quieter aircraft as part of fleet modernisation
•  Continually improving operational practices including 

continuous descents, slightly steeper approaches, low-power/ 
low-drag approaches and optimised departures

•  Internal governance and training and external advocacy 
in Ireland, Spain and the UK to manage noise challenges

A.2.3. Environmental management
Relevant standards: GRI 103-2
Overview
IAG is committed to improving our environmental performance and complying with recognised standards in our sector for 
environmental management on material issues identified in this report. Key priorities include working towards the IATA 
Environmental Assessment (IEnvA), meeting ISO 14001 requirements and improving the EcoVadis score of Group airlines 
participating in the questionnaire (British Airways and Iberia). 

Additionally, IAG GBS partnered with EcoVadis in 2022 to assess suppliers using EcoVadis scorecards, which consist of a holistic 
view of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. This gives IAG and its suppliers a baseline for improvements across 
ESG issues, and suppliers can share this with customers and other stakeholders to support sustainability across the industry.

Group airlines 2023 progress
In 2023, all Group airlines were fully certified under the IEnvA standard which is equivalent to ISO 14001 in all our flight operations 
and corporate buildings, complying with the core scope defined by IATA. 

Additionally, British Airways and Iberia have extended the certification to their maintenance activities at hub airports and, in the case 
of Iberia, also to its handling services in Madrid Airport. Iberia Airport Services holds an ISO 14001 in all the airports at which it 
operates, with the aim of guaranteeing that an environmentally responsible service is provided to its customers. 

In line with our commitment to supporting a more responsible supply chain, British Airways and Iberia respond annually to the 
EcoVadis questionnaire. EcoVadis is a market-leading provider of business ESG ratings. The response to this questionnaire is 
supported by the Group’s policies and practices, such as supplier engagement policies administered by IAG GBS, which also allows 
us to identify points of improvement to annually improve the score of all Group airlines. 

As part of our supply chain management objectives and our partnership with EcoVadis, IAG GBS has screened 90% of IAG’s spend 
using EcoVadis scorecards, which means screening more than 550 suppliers.

IAG third-party ESG assessments and awards
The Group also continues to provide evidence to support third-party ESG disclosures and rating assessment frameworks. 

In 2023, IAG has been awarded an A- grade by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for its climate change disclosure, which 
assessed more than 21,000 companies globally on climate action. This is the fourth year IAG has achieved a ‘leadership’ rating of A- 
or higher, the longest consecutive leadership rating of any airline, and places the Group in the top 25% of respondents worldwide. 

IAG was also the highest ranked aviation group in the global Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) in 2022, which assesses 600 
companies across 47 countries on their readiness for the low-carbon transition. IAG is in the top 10% of airlines assessed by 
Sustainalytics, which gives ESG risk ratings to around 15,000 companies worldwide based on public disclosures.

IAG was also awarded 2024 Eco-Airline of the year by Air Transport World for industry leadership and a best-in-class SAF 
programme, while Aer Lingus received the Aviation Sustainability and Environment award at the Irish Aviation 2023 Awards.

Working with pathway initiatives 
IAG supports the 1.5°C ambition of the Paris Agreement and continues to review evidence on aviation pathways which support this.

Where possible, IAG will work with relevant stakeholders, including the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and Transition 
Pathway Initiative (TPI), to build an understanding of aviation industry pathways to net zero, how these contribute to national 
and global goals, and how companies and policymakers can drive investment into a low carbon transition. IAG is supporting work 
led by the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) and the SBTI to update the 1.5oC guidance for the aviation sector.

B. People

B.1. Overview 
IAG's structure is unique. Together we 
work towards our common purpose of 
connecting people, businesses and 
countries. The IAG model empowers 
each operating company and platform 
business to deliver for its customers and 
people – with each being responsible for 
managing recruitment, pay and 
conditions for their colleagues, as well as 
careers and development – while 
centrally we look at opportunities for 
synergies across the Group. 

 Each operating company and platform 
business has its own culture and values 
which support its unique brand, 
business, customer and employee 
propositions. At IAG, we hold 
commitment, pragmatism, execution, 
ambition, resilience, challenge and 
innovation, responsibility, people focus 
and team players as key values that 
enable us to fulfil our purpose. These are 
woven throughout our ways of working, 
people processes and our people 
strategies. 

 Colleagues have consistently 
demonstrated these values in 
responding to the various challenges 
and opportunities they have faced 
across the year. We've made substantial 
headway in rebuilding capacity, 
enhancing resilience and flexibility, and 
making transformative changes in our 
business, whilst navigating operational 
challenges, particularly in British Airways 
and Aer Lingus.  

 Across the Group, our focus on culture 
and values is essential to our 
transformation and the execution of our 
strategy. Our operating companies are 
working to constantly evolve their 
cultures to enable their businesses to be 
more competitive and achieve our 
transformation agenda and to provide a 
great working environment in which all 
colleagues can thrive. We measure 
progress on our culture through a 
six-monthly Organisational Health Index 
(OHI) survey sent to all employees and 
through other employee listening 
channels (see the Stakeholder 
Engagement section for details). Insights 
from these channels feed into our 
operating companies’ priorities for 
improving and progressing our people 
policies, ways of working and shaping 
our people strategies. 

In 2022, our primary focus was to build 
back capacity to support our business 
and operations. In 2023, we have been 
able to focus on a broader range of 
people initiatives including: 

•  investing in the skills of our workforce 

and commitment to professional 
development and careers – including 
our award-winning apprentice 
programmes and our pilot and 
leadership programmes;

•  building the culture within each of our 

operating companies creates a 
positive colleague experience and 
drives customer-centricity and 
operational performance. Twice-yearly 
organisational health surveys enable 
tracking of progress and help focus 
people plans;

•  continuing to make progress towards 
our ambition of 40% senior leadership 
roles held by women by 2025. At year 
end 2023 we have 36% of senior roles 
held by women, a two-point increase 
in 2023 versus 2022 and an overall 
increase of six points since 2020;

•  building on initiatives already carried 

out in some of the operating 
companies, in 2023, we launched a 
voluntary, anonymous and confidential 
online survey to our senior leaders 
across the Group to gain a deeper 
understanding of the composition and 
diversity of IAG’s senior leadership, 
going beyond gender to include a 
broad range of factors regarding 
identity. The survey results will be 
shared with senior leaders to inform 
IAG’s people strategies and provide a 
baseline of the diversity of IAG’s 
senior leaders, enabling us to track 
progress over time and support 

discussions around equity, diversity 
and inclusion. An output of the survey 
feeds into the UK Parker Review, 
which focuses on ethnic diversity of 
Boards and senior leadership teams. 
6% of our UK senior leaders self-
disclosed as ethnically diverse and our 
senior leaders globally represent over 
20 nationalities. To ensure continued 
focus on increasing ethnic 
representation, we have introduced an 
ethnic diversity ambition of 10% for 
the Group’s UK senior leadership 
population by the end of 2027;

•  continued focus on creating an inclusive 
and diverse culture and organisation, 
encompassing the promotion of equity, 
diversity and inclusion, and upholding 
Group-wide policies designed to 
eradicate discrimination;

•  supporting the wellbeing of our 

colleagues through the provision 
of a range of health, financial, and 
lifestyle benefits. Each operating 
company is committed to creating 
a positive work environment 
and to actively contributing to and 
supporting the overall wellbeing of 
every colleague;

•  supporting colleagues through the 

broader transformation of the 
business including digitalisation, 
artificial intelligence, modernisation 
of our fleet, investments in customer 
and products; and

•  operating companies have actively 

engaged with trade unions to secure 
balanced agreements, ensuring fair 
and competitive remuneration. 
These negotiated agreements 
provide a critical foundation to 
support investment and foster growth.

B.3. Equity, Diversity 
and Inclusion
Relevant standards: GRI 405-1
At IAG we are proud of the diversity of 
the workforce across our Group 
companies and the richness of 
backgrounds, experiences, cultures and 
ideas that makes our businesses thrive. 
Our aim is that all colleagues feel their 
unique difference is recognised and 
valued. IAG continues to bring positive 
change and progress towards our equity, 
diversity, and inclusion (EDI) ambition to 
create a diverse and inclusive culture 
representative of the communities we 
live and work in and the customers we 
serve. We also believe that a diverse 
workforce performs better and is more 
resilient, innovative and productive.

Progress on gender diversity
With regards to gender, our Board 
comprises 45% women, the IAG 
Management Committee 25% women 
and we have over 44% of women across 
our workforce. In 2022, we set a Group-
wide ambition to have 40% of senior 
leadership roles held by women by 2025. 
We have seen a significant increase in 
gender diversity in senior leadership to 
36% in 2023, a two-point increase since 
2022 and six points since 2020 and are 
on track to achieve our 40% ambition. 

Going beyond gender
Our Group-wide plans go beyond 
gender, and we are implementing 
a range of initiatives to support our 
diversity and inclusion ambition, whilst 
recognising the cultural sensitivities and 
legal contexts we operate in globally, 
and the need to comply with evolving 
reporting requirements.

In 2023, we partnered with an 
independent UK-based talent and 
diversity consultancy, Green Park, to 
gain a deeper understanding of the 
composition and diversity of our senior 
leaders, going beyond gender to include 
a broad range of factors regarding 
identity. A voluntary, anonymous 
and confidential online survey was sent 
to senior leaders across the Group. 

We are delighted that 88% of our senior 
leaders globally responded to the survey 
(193 out of 2191 leaders invited) with a 
96% response rate in the UK (91 out of 
95 leaders invited). While some of the 
operating companies were already 
capturing broader demographic data 
shared by colleagues, this is the first 
time we have surveyed our senior 
leaders across the Group with questions 
tailored to local legal and cultural 
contexts. 

The survey provides a baseline to better 
understand the diversity of our senior 
leadership population, enables us to 
track progress over time and to continue 
and broaden our dialogue with our 
senior leaders around equity, diversity 
and inclusion.

Financial StatementsCorporate GovernanceStrategic ReportEthnicity reporting methodology

Our data relies on senior leaders 
self-disclosing their diversity status. 
Individuals who have chosen not to 
report their ethnicity are not included in 
the calculation as minority ethnic 
leaders. 

We use the following methodology 
to calculate:

% of ethnically diverse 
senior leadership in UK
=
(Total number of UK leaders who 
self-identify as minority ethnic)

(Total number of senior leaders in UK)

Aligned with the UK Parker Review 
guidance:

•  a leader is identified as 'minority 

ethnic' if they self-disclose as one of 
the following groups: Asian, Black, 
Mixed/Multiple, Other (with 
the option to describe the ethnicity) 
or Prefer to Self-define (where the 
ethnicity maps to an ethnic minority 
category); and

•  a leader is not included as 'minority 
ethnic' if they identify as White, 
Prefer not to Say, Do not Consent to 
data being processed, Prefer to 
Self-define (where the ethnicity does 
not map to an ethnic minority 
category) or did not reply to the 
survey.

Three different surveys were designed 
for the UK, Ireland and Spain – aligned 
to each country’s legal and cultural 
context – using local census questions 
and classifications. In some countries 
we did not include the ethnicity 
question due to the legal and cultural 
context. Where collected, the ethnicity 
results provided to IAG have been 
aggregated and mapped to the UK 
ONS classification categories. 

Data is held by Green Park and only 
shared with IAG and its companies for 
reporting at an aggregate level with 
minimum thresholds to safeguard 
anonymity. 

We define senior leaders as IAG 
grades 0, 1 and 2 or equivalent across 
the Group, including Senior Executives 
(direct reports to IAG's CEO).

Sustainability continued 
B. People

Focusing on ethnicity and nationality
One of the areas we focused on in the 2023 
survey was ethnicity. 6% of our senior 
leaders based in the UK self-disclosed as 
ethnically diverse. Two leaders responded 
Prefer not to Say and four did not consent 
to their data being processed.

We recognise that we have progress to 
make and are introducing an ambition for 
10% of the Group’s UK senior leadership 
population to identify as ethnically diverse 
by the end of 2027. This has the support 
of both the Board and Management 
Committee. We have decided to focus our 
ethnicity ambition on the UK as ethnicity 
and race are well-defined characteristics 
aligned with census data. We support the 
recommendations of the Parker Review in 
the UK both in terms of reporting the ethnic 
diversity of our Board and senior leaders, 
and in setting an ambition for 2027. 

Given IAG’s global focus we see great 
value in having diverse ethnic, national 
and cultural backgrounds represented in 
the workforce: across our 71,794 
colleagues, we have over 150 
nationalities. The survey highlighted that 
our senior leaders globally represent over 
20 nationalities. In the UK, 34% of senior 
leaders self-disclosed as a nationality 
other than British.

The survey results are being shared with 
our senior leaders and used to inform our 
people strategies. We remain committed 
to creating a diverse and inclusive 
culture. We will continue to uphold 
Group-wide policies designed to 
eradicate discrimination and to focus on 
open and transparent people processes, 
mindful choices of search partners, 
diverse recruitment shortlists and more 
rigorous definitions of critical role 
requirements, focusing on capabilities 
rather than experience.

Collaborating on EDI across the 
Group and supporting progress 
across our industry
The IAG Diversity Panel, created in 2021, 
sees representatives across all operating 
companies sharing best practice and 
leading on the co-design and 
implementation of new EDI initiatives 
that guide us towards our ambition.

We continue to partner with Women in 
Hospitality, Travel and Leisure (WiHTL).
This year several operating companies 
participated in WiHTL’s EDI maturity 
assessment and benchmarking exercise, 
in partnership with the Centre for 
Diversity Policy Research and Practice at 
Oxford Brookes Business School. Both 
at Group and operating company level 
we continue to collaborate with industry 
peers and were recently awarded the 
WiHTL ‘Most Engaged Member’ at its 
2023 Inclusion Summit.

We actively partner with International Air 
Transport Association (IATA) and are 
committed to advancing gender diversity 
as part of IATA’s 25 by 2025 strategy (a 
global initiative to enhance EDI and 
gender balance in the aviation sector). 

Each airline is looking at increasing the 
diversity of its pilot populations through 
talent attraction and recruitment 
practices and through school 
engagement and outreach programmes. 
British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia 
have launched fully or semi-funded pilot 
cadet programmes. 

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion 
examples
Aer Lingus has made strides in gender 
diversity within the Future Pilot 
Programme, with the first successful 
cohort comprising approximately 27% 
women. Aer Lingus currently has 11% of 
pilot roles filled by women, the third-
highest gender representation of pilots 
of all airlines globally (Source: 
International Society of Women Airline 
Pilots 2021). 

British Airways launched the Speedbird 
Pilot Academy, funding 70 spaces aimed 
at removing financial barriers to entry 
for pilot roles, while also introducing the 
'Be an Original' inclusion and diversity 
learning programme for all colleagues. 
British Airways also launched a 
reverse mentoring programme pairing 
80 senior managers with colleagues 
from under-represented ethnicities to 
promote awareness and improve 
inclusion. Additionally, British Airways 
focused on increasing representation 
through internships, apprenticeship 

British Airways' newly 
established Colleague 
Accessibility Network 
Group 

programmes and work experience 
placements – opening up different entry 
routes to a higher proportion of ethnic 
minority colleagues and those from 
lower socio-economic backgrounds. 
As it participates in Europe's largest event 
for black entrepreneurs, British Airways 
actively encourages and engages 
in cultural activities that are important 
to colleagues across the business. 

IAG Cargo introduced a new training 
hub with a flexible bank holiday policy 
to promote inclusivity. Additionally, it has 
revamped its prayer room and nursing 
room to be fully accessible. IAG Cargo 
took second place in The Equity Index 
2022/23 produced by Lead 5050, a UK 
cross-industry accreditation body, that 
ranks firms using official data on average 
salaries, bonuses, and pay at every level. 
The business also supported the 
'everywoman in Transport and Logistics 
Awards' that promotes and inspires 
women within the industry.

IAG GBS is actively fostering an inclusive 
workplace through the initiatives of its 
Inclusion Network/Community Groups, 
including the LGBTQ+ Network and 
Working Parents and Carers Network. 
A strategic partnership with MyGWork, 
the largest professional speciality 
platform for the LGBTQ+ community, 
offers a range of collaborative efforts 
such as job postings, speaker events, 
Pride celebrations and access to a 
substantial talent community. 

IAG Loyalty engaged a representative 
group of colleagues focused on driving 
an inclusion and belonging agenda. The 
group designed and led a calendar of 
EDI events and experiences based on 
colleague listening and survey data. 
There have been high levels of 
engagement across all topics including 
Pride, International Women's Day, 
Menopause Day, Baby Loss Awareness, 
Ramadan and other events designed by 
colleagues, for colleagues.

IAG Tech proudly supports women 
in the tech sector, sponsoring the 
‘Outstanding Women of the Year’ 
award at the Women in Tech event and 
maintaining job postings on platforms 
such as the Diversity in Tech website.

Vueling and Iberia have refreshed their 
equality plans this year. Noteworthy 
progress at Vueling includes an 
increased percentage of women 
in management positions. Iberia’s 
strategic focus through a supported 
network of over 200 colleague diversity 
ambassadors who help raise awareness, 
identify organisational barriers and 
who are consulted on company 
processes. This is supplemented with 
mandatory training for the entire 
company. 

Co-parenting responsibilities
Relevant standards: GRI 401-3
The Group's operating companies 
prioritise work-life balance, especially 
in the context of co-parenting 
responsibilities. They have a range of 
policies covering job-sharing, maternity, 
adoption, paternity and shared parental 
leave to support employees managing 
co-parenting commitments. Online 
platforms facilitate a collaborative 
community for working parents and 
carers, enabling the exchange of ideas 
and mutual support, while also providing 
access to digital resources offering 
valuable information for maintaining 
a healthy work-life balance.

IAG Loyalty, as one of its focus areas,  
looked at parental leave with an equity 
lens, emphasising support for both 
parents rather than just the primary 
carer or birthing parent. This initiative 
applies in both the UK and Spain.

Universal accessibility for people 
with disabilities
Relevant standards: GRI 405-1
The Group adheres to all pertinent 
legislation, guaranteeing universal access 
for both employees and customers with 
disabilities across our operating 
companies. Our operating companies 
strictly adhere to relevant accessibility 
laws in our facilities and overall operations.

Each of our operating airlines is 
committed to providing a seamless 
customer experience, especially for 
those with disabilities. Collaborating 
with external organisations, including 
the Business Disability Forum in the UK, 
our airlines seek guidance and support 
to enhance their efforts and strategies.

British Airways has developed a 
comprehensive guide to provide support 
for customers with disabilities, ensuring 
their needs are addressed with clarity 
and thoughtfulness. Furthermore, a 
proactive approach to inclusivity is 
evident in the neurodiversity training 
offered to managers at all levels.

A new Colleague Accessibility Network 
Group at British Airways has been 
established, with a senior-level sponsor 
to steer its initiatives. 

B.4. Health, safety and wellbeing 
Overview
Relevant standards: GRI 403-4, 403-6
At IAG, we are committed to the health, 
safety and wellbeing of employees, 
customers, and stakeholders, whether 
in the sky or on the ground. Our focus 
encompasses preventing accidents and 
diseases, controlling existing risks, and 
championing continual improvement in 
health and safety conditions. The IAG 
SECR Committee plays a pivotal role in 
overseeing operational safety and 
corporate responsibility. 

We operate in compliance with laws, 
regulations, company policies and 
industry standards, and maintain a robust 
suite of health and safety management 
systems across our operating companies. 
Driving this commitment are governance 
processes led by committees within each 
operating company. 

Operating companies have made 
substantial investments in initiatives that 
address various aspects of employee 
wellbeing, taking a holistic approach that 
integrates physical, social, and financial 
elements, alongside mental wellbeing. 

Accident and severity rates are lower 
compared to 2019, with a Lost Time 
Injury (LTI) frequency rate of 3.7 
instances per 200,000 hours worked.

Key initiatives
Aer Lingus ran a Health and Wellbeing 
Week across three locations in Ireland, 
featuring 21 different events. The week 
included initiatives such as flu 
vaccination vouchers for all staff, 
comprehensive health checks, 
reflexology treatment clinics, in-chair 
massage clinics, defibrillator training and 
webinars for family carers with guest 
speakers. Additionally, Aer Lingus 
provided an opportunity for colleagues 
to try the ‘’smoothie bike’’, a unique and 
engaging way to have fun, keep fit and 
promote sustainable energy and healthy 
living. The airline actively promotes a 
comprehensive wellbeing portal 
accessible to all staff. This resource 
encompasses content on various 
wellbeing topics, including mental and 
physical health, monthly themed 
informational webinars, a digital gym 
offering online classes, an exercise 
library and nutrition resources. 
Regarding safety, Aer Lingus has a 
safety engagement programme which 
empowers managers and supervisors to 
reduce risk of injuries by discussing safe 
and unsafe actions. 

Aer Lingus and British Airways have 
revised their Health and Safety 
e-learning induction training for new 
staff, in addition to holding regular 
communication through Health and 
Safety action groups, promoting safe 
behaviours, handling and training.

British Airways provides a leading 
peer support programme for pilots, 
tied to professional psychology support. 
The airline is committed to ISO 45001 
standards, enhancing operating 
processes to prevent work-related injury 
and illness. In addition, a dedicated 
in-house occupational health service 
has been established, providing CAA 
regulatory medical examinations tailored 
for pilots and cabin crew. This service 
extends for all colleagues in specific 
trades, all in strict accordance with 
UK health and safety legislation. British 
Airways has a network of 150 dedicated 
wellbeing champions collaborating 
closely with health services to support 
new and existing initiatives. British 
Airways provides all colleagues globally 
with complimentary access to ‘Unmind’ 
– an online wellness platform developed 
by experts in neuroscience, cognitive 
behavioural therapy, mindfulness and 
positive psychology. Additionally, British 
Airways has signed the ‘working with 

cancer’ pledge as well as collaborating 
with Endometriosis UK, creating a 
supportive workplace for colleagues 
living or impacted by these conditions. 

Iberia’s commitment to employee 
wellbeing is an integral part of the 
’Elige cuidarte’ (‘Choose to take care 
of yourself’) programme within 
Occupational Prevention Management. In 
2023, Iberia’s efforts encompassed a 
range of initiatives, including 
physiotherapy services, heightened 
awareness of prostate cancer, annual flu 
vaccinations and the promotion of 
physical fitness through the 'Use the 
Stairs' campaign. Iberia has well-
established health and safety committees 
in each of its relevant work centres.

IAG Cargo and British Airways 
introduced new menopause guidelines 
supported by a combination of online 
webinars and roundtable discussions.

IAG Cargo established a cohort of circa 
100 Mental Health First Aiders 
throughout the organisation and has 
implemented fitness classes and a 
comprehensive wellbeing guide to 
promote a holistic approach to health. 

IAG GBS employees access valuable tips 
on managing their wellbeing through 
medical health webinars, resilience 
training, yoga, pilates and online courses. 
Additionally, the introduction of the 
Headspace app for all employees and 
their friends and family has seen 
a remarkable 90% participation rate. 

IAG Loyalty ensures colleagues have 
easy access to wellbeing resources, 
a central hub page allowing seamless 
navigation to content at any time. 
In addition, it orchestrated engaging 
events and curated unique content 
during Blue Monday and Mental Health 
Awareness week, prioritising mental, 
physical and financial wellbeing, finding 
every opportunity to combine fitness 
with community activities. 

IAG Tech has implemented Mental 
Health employee first aiders who play 
a crucial role in offering support to 
colleagues during challenging times.

Industry-leading standards are being 
recognised across the Group and, in 
2023, Vueling received the Premio 
Empresa Xcellens award which 
recognises all the work Vueling has done 
to promote a genuinely preventive 
culture and improving employees’ 
quality of life. Vueling also holds 
quarterly meetings with its health and 
safety committee, composed of Vueling 
management and trade union appointed 
safety representatives.

B.5. Human rights and modern 
slavery
IAG had no known cases of human 
rights violations across the Group during 
2023, the same as in 2022. IAG is taking 
steps to prevent incidents of modern 
slavery within the Group and across its 
supply chains.

The IAG Group Slavery and Human 
Trafficking Statement outlines these 
actions and is available on the IAG 
website. This statement is made under 
section 54, part 5 of the 2015 UK Modern 
Slavery Act (MSA). In terms of policies 
associated with human rights, IAG asks 
suppliers to comply with the Supplier 
Code of Conduct, which expressly 
prohibits the use of child labour and any 
form of slave, bonded, forced or 
involuntary prison labour, human 
trafficking or exploitation. Modern 

slavery clauses feature in all new 
supplier contracts as well as contract 
renewals, which require full compliance 
with all applicable anti-slavery and 
human trafficking laws, statutes, 
regulations and codes. 

IAG remains committed to taking swift 
and robust action if any evidence 
relating to slavery or human trafficking 
in our business supply chain is identified.

IAG is taking steps to prevent human 
trafficking. Human trafficking is of 
particular concern to IAG and to the 
wider aviation industry, as the Group 
transports millions of passengers every 
year and has tens of thousands of 
suppliers across the world. Operating 
airlines work closely with governments 
and the airports in which they operate to 
ensure that any suspected trafficking on 
our flights is identified, reported and 

dealt with appropriately. IAG also 
supports the 2018 IATA resolution 
denouncing human trafficking and 
reaffirming a commitment to tackle 
this issue and the ICAO Guidelines 
for Reporting Trafficking in Persons 
by Flight and Cabin Crew – in addition 
to actively contributing to the 
ICAO Ad Hoc Working Group on 
Combating Trafficking in Supply 
Chain (AHWG-TSP), an international, 
joint industry-regulatory group 
providing advice to ICAO assisting in 
the development of guidance material 
on combating trafficking in persons 
in an air operator’s supply chain.

Operating airlines also train staff to 
recognise and respond to the signs of 
potential human trafficking situations 
and provide procedures for reporting 
where any cases are suspected.

C. Principles of sustainability governance

C.1. Sustainability strategy 
IAG’s vision is to be a world-leading 
airline group on sustainability.

That means using its scale, influence 
and track record to not only transform 
the business but drive the system-wide 
changes required to create a truly 
sustainable aviation industry. IAG is 
committed to delivering best practices 
in sustainability programmes, processes 
and impacts, while executing Group 
strategy. 

IAG aligns its environmental strategy 
with the three overall strategic priorities 
of the business described in the 
Strategy section.

Material issues 
IAG focuses its sustainability strategy 
on addressing material issues: those 
which are most important to key 
stakeholders and which have the biggest 
external impacts. 

To identify these issues over a three-year 
timeframe and to 2030, IAG repeated a 
materiality assessment in 2021 which was 
facilitated by an independent third party. 
External stakeholders included investors, 
corporate customers, policy makers, 
trade associations, fuel suppliers, airports, 
and NGOs. Internal stakeholders included 
IAG Board members, all IAG Management 
Committee members, and operating 
company sustainability representatives. 
The results inform ongoing disclosures 
and strategy.

In our 2021 materiality assessment, 
tackling climate change was identified as 
the most material issue in the long-term. 
In the short-term, as the business 
recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, 
profitability and customer and employee 
engagement and wellbeing remain 
high priorities. 

IAG does not have specific risk 
provisions, targets or guarantees related 
to non-material issues such as water 
consumption, biodiversity, raw materials 
consumption, or light pollution. More 
information on water and biodiversity 
is available in the Additional Disclosures 
section of the IAG statement of non-
financial information.

IAG will seek a double materiality 
assessment when it next repeats 
this analysis in 2024.

Relevant standards: GRI 102-46/-48
Overview
IAG has robust governance in place to ensure joined-up and progressive decisions on sustainability. 

This also helps to ensure that wider stakeholder engagement is consistent with material issues and environmental priorities and 
goals. An annual meeting planner for the Board ensures sustainability governance processes fit within the reporting and disclosure 
framework of the Group.

The Group’s unique structure means that each individual operating company has a distinct sustainability programme. These are 
regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with the Group sustainability strategy and principles, which covers material issues, KPIs 
and engagement plans. 

Relevant forums and levels of responsibility are indicated below. Information flows between groups is covered in section C.6., Risk

C.3. Workforce governance 
Relevant standards: GRI 2-30, 404-1, 
404-2.
Each operating company within IAG 
is committed to creating a work 
environment in which safety and 
wellbeing are paramount, in which 
employees are treated fairly and 
rewarded appropriately, and feel 
motivated and can thrive. We believe 
our employees are central to the 
continued success of the Group.

Working policies and rights at work
At IAG our core principles include fair 
and equal treatment, non-discrimination, 
fairness and respect for human rights. 
These are central to our IAG Code of 
Conduct which applies to all employees 
and directors across the Group. 
Employees have been equipped with 
comprehensive training and 
development opportunities, ensuring 
they are well-versed in essential topics 
such as the Code of Conduct and 
Compliance with Competition Laws.

Operating companies are responsible 
for their own supplementary employee 
policies and procedures, including 
appropriate reward frameworks aligned 
to local markets and roles, so they 
remain competitive in attracting the best 
talent. We have seen a wide selection 
of employee benefits and recognition 
schemes introduced in the operating 
companies. For senior leader 
remuneration across our operating 
companies, we have deliberately focused 
on variable pay and long-term incentives, 
aligning leadership compensation with 
performance and long-term strategic 
goals to drive performance. We have 
taken a restrained approach to executive 
pay, remaining committed to fairness 
and competitiveness.

49%

Collective bargaining arrangements are 
in place for 87% of the workforce.

Our operating companies have focused 
on securing collective bargaining 
agreements with unions to ensure fair, 
competitive and sustainable pay – 
providing stability for our business and 
colleagues in challenging times. 

IAG complies with International Labour 
Organization (ILO) conventions. These 
conventions cover fundamental 
principles and rights at work: freedom of 
association, the effective recognition of 
the right to collective bargaining, the 
elimination of all forms of forced or 
compulsory labour, the elimination of 
discrimination in respect of employment 
and occupation. 

IAG operating companies have effective 
dialogue through employee forums and 
through trade unions where they are 
recognised. In addition, the IAG 
European Works Council (EWC) 
facilitates communication and 
consultation between employees and 
management on transnational European 
matters. The EWC includes 
representatives from the different 
European Economic Area (EEA) 
countries. It meets regularly throughout 
the year to inform and, where 
appropriate, consult on transnational 
matters which impact employees in two 
or more EEA countries. 

Each operating company continues to 
focus on engagement, listening and 
acting on colleague feedback. In addition 
to specific initiatives to measure 
employee satisfaction, IAG runs a 
twice-yearly Organisational Health Index 
(OHI) survey to track our transformation 
and culture development, and to 
benchmark management practices and 
leaders against a global external 
framework. Alongside leadership support, 
each operating company has established 
teams to identify themes and incorporate 
these into broader people plans.

Finally, Board members carry out 
workforce engagement visits with 
colleagues across our operating 
companies – meeting a variety of 
employees and leaders in their work 
context to better understand the 
challenges and opportunities of the 
different businesses, employee issues 
and levels of engagement. This is shared 
with the Board to provide a balanced 
perspective of stakeholder views and to 
support broader decision-making.

Training and development
Each operating company is responsible 
for the learning, development and talent 
management within its business and 
ensuring its workforce has the necessary 
skills to support its strategy. 

While training policies and programmes 
are implemented at the operating 
company level, all companies are 
required to run mandatory corporate 
training courses on topics such as the 
Code of Conduct, Compliance with 
Competition Laws, Anti-bribery and 
Corruption Compliance, and Data 
Privacy, Security, and Protection.

Overview
IAG Global Business Services (IAG GBS) 
continues to engage with, support and 
monitor suppliers to ensure all products 
and services provided to IAG are on a 
path to net zero by 2050.

The IAG GBS Group Procurement team 
leads the Supply Chain Sustainability 
Programme by delivering in four key areas:

•  The Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC);
•  Independent risk screening and 

sustainability assessments;

•  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 

Audits; and

•  Embedding sustainability as standard 

in the procurement process.

1  Average training hours is based on the total training hours performed per average headcount, pro-rated to Full Time Equivalent (FTE)

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Activities in 2023
The SCoC continues to be shared with 
new suppliers as part of the onboarding 
process. New suppliers are requested 
to acknowledge their commitment 
to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, 
and the need for a roadmap, supported 
by deliverable plans, to achieve this target.

IAG GBS is also partnering with 
EcoVadis, a market-leading provider 
of business sustainability ratings, 
to assess supplier scorecards with a 
comprehensive methodology covering 
environment, labour and human rights, 
ethics and sustainable procurement. 

This gives IAG and its suppliers a 
baseline for improvements, and suppliers 
can share them with customers and 
other stakeholders, which benefits wider 
industry sustainability. Once a scorecard 
is shared with IAG GBS, results are 
reviewed to ensure the suppliers 
sustainability performance is aligned 
with IAG’s vision and strategy. If a 
supplier's performance score is assessed 
as less than 45 (out of 100), a Corrective 
Action Plan (CAP) is requested for 
improvement.

IAG became a SEDEX member in 2023. 
SEDEX provides data insights to help 
companies improve ESG performance. 
As part of the SCoC adherence and 
legislation requirements under the UK 
Modern Slavery Act, suppliers are 
subject to third-party audit under a 
labour and human rights protocol such 
as the SEDEX Members Ethical Trade 
Audit (SMETA) methodology. In 2023, 
38 of these audits were completed. By 
joining SEDEX, IAG aims to understand 
information about the ethical practices 
of their suppliers, including audits. 

All suppliers also undergo annual 
compliance screening for any legal and 
financial risks. The Group Procurement 
and Compliance teams assess any 
suppliers identified as having potentially 
higher levels of risk and implement 
mitigation plans where necessary. Any 
issues are flagged to the risk owners 
within the Group to jointly take 
appropriate action.

IAG GBS has embedded sustainability 
aspects into the day-to-day operation of 
the organisation and included 
sustainability targets in the performance 
objectives of all IAG GBS employees. 

IAG GBS has verified the existing, active 
supplier base and IAG's airlines’ interline 
relationships in Russia and Belarus in 
order to determine the potential 
implications of, and actions to be taken, 
due to the trade sanctions issued as a 
response to the war in Ukraine. IAG has 
provided operating companies with 
support on mitigation actions to be 
taken (e.g. payment stop/blockage). 
This has been performed in coordination 
with Compliance Teams.

Building a sustainable future in 2024
In 2024, IAG GBS will work to have 
EcoVadis scorecards in place covering 
90% of IAG’s total spend. “High-risk” 
suppliers based on SEDEX’s risk 
assessment will also be required to 
perform an independent SMETA audit.

Overview
All directors and employees are 
expected to act with integrity and in 
accordance with the laws of the 
countries in which they operate. 

IAG’s Code of Conduct, last revised in 
2019 and approved by the Board, sets 
out the general guidelines that govern 
the conduct of all directors and 
employees of the Group when 
performing their duties in their business 
and professional relationships. IAG does 
not use Company funds or resources to 
support any political party or candidate. 
Mandatory Code of Conduct training 
and communications activities are 
carried out for directors, employees and 
third parties on a regular basis to 
maintain awareness and understanding 
of the principles that govern the 
conduct of the Group. This document is 
available on the IAG website.

In 2023, a new Group Head of Ethics and 
Compliance was appointed, with the 
overall responsibility for developing, 
maintaining and overseeing the 
implementation of the enterprise-wide 
IAG compliance programme, which 
includes the harmonisation of the 
programme across the different operating 
companies and supporting an overarching 
ethics and compliance culture. 

IAG has in place a Group-wide 
Whistleblowing Policy and a 
consolidated whistleblowing channel 
provided by an independent third-party 
provider, Navex, where concerns can be 
raised on an anonymous and confidential 
basis. This channel is available to 
members of staff as well as suppliers, 
with information on how to access it 
published in IAG’s Code of Conduct and 
Supplier Code of Conduct. If any 
employee has a concern about unethical 
behaviour or organisational integrity, 
they are encouraged to first speak with 
their manager or a member of the Legal, 
Compliance or Human Resource teams. 
Similarly, suppliers are encouraged to 
contact their primary contact within the 
business. Regardless, the whistleblowing 
channel is available for everyone who 
wishes to report a concern. 

IAG will not tolerate any retaliation 
against individuals using the 
whistleblowing channel or contributing 
to investigations arising from reports to 
the whistleblowing channel. 
Whistleblowing reports received for 
each operating company are triaged by 
the Compliance teams to direct to the 
most appropriate area for investigation, 
maintaining independence in this 
investigation process. 

The IAG Audit and Compliance 
Committee reviews the effectiveness of 
the external whistleblowing channel and 
internal relevant reporting channels on 
an annual basis. This annual review 
considers the volume of reports by 
category; timeliness of follow-up; 
process and responsibility for follow-up; 
emerging themes and lessons; and any 
issues raised of significance to the 
financial statements or reputation of the 
Group or other areas of compliance.

In 2023, whistleblowing reports 
concerned issues relating to 
employment matters (61%), dishonest 
behaviour/reputation (34%), health and 
safety (3%) and regulatory matters (2%). 
All reports were followed up and 
investigated where appropriate and 
measures were implemented where 
concerns were identified.

Anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering
IAG and its operating companies do not 
tolerate any form of bribery or 
corruption. This is made clear in the 
Group Code of Conduct and supporting 
policies which are available to all 
directors and employees. An anti-bribery 
policy statement is also set out in the 
Supplier Code of Conduct. 

IAG has in place a Group-wide anti-
bribery and corruption policy. This 
document sets out the minimum 
standards that are expected by the 
Group, its directors and employees, 
including definitions and guidance for 
bribery, gifts and hospitality guidance, 
political and charitable donations, public 
officials, facilitation payments amongst 
others. 

Each Group operating company has a 
Compliance Department, responsible for 
managing the anti-bribery programme in 
its business. The compliance teams from 

across the Group meet regularly through 
Working Groups and Steering Groups, 
under the coordination of IAG’s Group 
Head of Ethics and Compliance. They 
conduct an annual review of bribery 
risks at operating company and Group 
level.

The main compliance risks identified for 
2023 were unchanged from the previous 
year and relate to the use of third 
parties, operational and commercial 
decisions involving government 
agencies, and the inappropriate use of 
gifts and hospitality. No material 
compliance breaches were identified in 
2023, as in 2022. Anti-bribery and 
corruption training is mandatory for all 
relevant personnel in IAG operating 
companies and Group functions. 
Individual training requirements are set 
by each operating company and 
function and are determined by factors 
such as the level and responsibilities of 
an employee. A Group-wide anti-bribery 
e-learning module was rolled out in 2019 
and is required to be completed every 
three years. 

To identify, manage and mitigate 
potential bribery and corruption risks, 
IAG uses risk-based third-party due 
diligence which includes screenings, 
external reports, interviews and site 
visits depending on the level of risk that 
a third party presents. Any risks 
identified during the due diligence 
process are analysed and a mitigation 
plan put in place as necessary. Certain 
risks could result in termination of the 
proposed or existing relationship with 
the counterparty. The IAG Audit and 
Compliance Committee receives an 
annual update on the anti-bribery 
compliance programme.

There were no legal cases regarding 
corruption brought against the Group 
and its operating companies in 2023, as 
in 2022, and management is not aware 
of any impending cases or underlying 
issues.

IAG has processes and procedures in 
place across the Group, such as supplier 
vetting and management, Know Your 
Counterparty procedures and financial 
policies and controls, which help to 
combat money laundering and other 
compliance risks across the business.

C.6. ESG risk management 
Relevant standards: GRI 102-11/-15.
Overview
Sustainable aviation risks and People, 
culture and employee relations risks 
are reported as principal risks to IAG.

These risks are considered and assessed 
under the Group Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) framework which 
is presented bi-annually to the Audit 
and Compliance Committee and 
annually to the SECR Committee and 
Board. More details on this framework, 
risk identification and assessment, and 
risk management can be found in the 
Risk management and principal risk 
factors section. 

All principal risks are linked to the 
Group strategic priorities which include 
sustainability.

Sustainability risks and opportunities, 
including climate-related risks and 
opportunities, are also identified and 
assessed by the Group Sustainability 
team, in conjunction with the Group 
ERM team, and presented to the IAG 
CPCASO, IAG Management Committee 
and SECR Committee. Plans to mitigate 
risks are developed by relevant risk 
owners in specific areas of the business, 
with agreed initiatives included in 
relevant operating company business 
plans. Where risk treatments require 
time to implement, short-term 
mitigations are assessed and the 
timeline to risk mitigation and 
consequent risk acceptance discussed 
and agreed by stakeholders. 

operating companies with guidance 
from the Group as appropriate.

have uncertain but potentially negative 
outcomes on the environment or people. 

Impact on operations and strategy
Sustainability risk assessments have 
informed specific decisions related to 
business operations and strategy, and 
IAG allocates significant resources to 
environmental risk management. 

Examples include:

•  In 2019, IAG designed and adopted 
the industry leading Flightpath Net 
Zero strategy in response to the need 
for more ambitious action on climate 
change. The Group maintains its 
commitment to net zero emissions 
by 2050, and continues to invest 
to meet that strategy;

•  In 2021, IAG set a new net zero target 
by 2050 for Scope 3 emissions and 
IAG GBS appointed EcoVadis to 
help to track supplier sustainability 
performance and mitigate supply 
chain-related sustainability risks;

•  In 2022, IAG expanded its 

commitment to invest in SAF 
development, production and supply, 
to manage climate policy risks and 
take advantage of energy-related 
opportunities; and 

•  As of 31 December 2023, IAG 

investment in SAF production and 
supply increased further to $1 billion, 
of which 86% is future commitments, 
as we continue to scale up the use 
of SAF in our operations. This price is 
based on an assumed jet fuel price of 
$800 per metric tonne and contracted 
margins for SAF production.

IAG adopts precautionary measures to 
mitigate these hazards, an approach 
known as the precautionary principle. 
For example, the precautionary principle 
is applied to the planning of operations 
and the development and launch of new 
services IAG integrates climate 
considerations into three-year business 
plans and one-year financial forecasts 
and aligning activities with 
the Flightpath Net Zero strategy.

IAG also manages risks via the use of 
ISO-14001-aligned environmental 
management systems. IEnvA is the 
airline industry version of ISO 14001, the 
international standard for environmental 
management systems. IEnvA is tailored 
specifically for airlines and is fully 
compatible with the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO). 

The Group’s airlines completed the 
certification process for the IEnvA 
standard in 2023, except for Vueling 
which achieved Stage 2 certification in 
2022. Following this exercise, both 
British Airways and Aer Lingus were 
awarded Stage 2 certification in 2023. 
Iberia was awarded Stage 2 certification 
in January 2024. Please refer to section 
A.2.3. ’Environmental Management’ 
for more details.

In terms of the amount of provisions and 
warranties for environmental risks, IAG 
and its operating companies does not 
currently take out any specific insurance 
to cover environmental risks.

People, culture and employee relations 
risks are managed by the Group’s 

IAG is committed to mitigating the 
impacts of hazards which, if they occur,

C.7.1. Reporting and data 
governance 
The full contents of this sustainability 
report are included in the IAG Non-
Financial and Sustainability Information 
Statement (NFIS), which is third-party 
independently verified to limited 
assurance standards in line with 
ISAE3000 (Revised)1 standards. IAG is 
working towards reasonable assurance 
by 2026. Compliance with specific 
frameworks and standards is listed 
under relevant section headings.

IAG complies with current and emerging 
standards on sustainability reporting. 

These include obligations under EU 
Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial 
reporting and its transposition in the 
UK and Spain, the 2018 UK Streamlined 
Energy and Carbon Reporting 
regulation, the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), 
and the EU Taxonomy Regulation 
(2020/852).

IAG aligns with selected GRI standards 
based on compliance with Spanish Law 
11/2018. In cases where GRI alignment 
was not possible, other standards 
aligned to airline industry guidance or 
internal frameworks were used and 
described.

Emissions data from intra-European 
flights is also independently verified 
within six months of the year end, for 
compliance with the UK and EU ETS, 
and for all flights for the UN CORSIA 
scheme. Any material changes to key 
metrics are highlighted in future Annual 
Reports.

IAG also goes beyond compliance 
requirements and voluntarily aligns 
sustainability reporting with the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB), the IATA Airlines 
Reporting Handbook, GRI Standards 
for material issues, and relevant criteria 
from external ESG rating agencies. 
IAG supported IATA and the GRI 
to develop the IATA handbook. 

The scope of environment performance 
data in this report includes all IAG 
airlines, subsidiaries and cargo 
operations over which IAG has 
operational control. This is also the 
scope of the net zero targets. Some 
exceptions for non-material business 
units have been applied for specific 
metrics, and these are clearly stated 
with rationale provided.

The scope of workforce and ethics and 
integrity data includes all IAG operating 
companies and support functions. Some 
exceptions have been applied and these 
are clearly stated with rationale 
provided.

The scope of human rights and modern 
slavery reporting is as above and 
includes data from all suppliers in the 
IAG supply chain.

For any specific cases where full-year 
data was not available for selected 
metrics, estimates have been applied 
based on business forecasts and data 
from prior months. Internal governance 
is in place to ensure that any estimations 
made are robust. Any prior-year 
restatements are indicated next to 
relevant metrics with reasons provided.

Risk management and principal risk factors

Agile risk management helping 
to protect the Group as it delivers 
its strategic plan

Enterprise risk policy and framework
The Group has an enterprise risk 
management (ERM) framework 
underpinned by an ERM policy, which 
has been updated in accordance with 
Spanish corporate law and governance 
and UK corporate governance 
requirements and has been re-approved 
by the Board in 2023. This sets out a 
comprehensive risk management 
process and methodology to ensure a 
robust identification and assessment of 
the risks facing the Group, including 
emerging risks. The risk management 
framework is embedded across all of the 
Group’s businesses. Enterprise risks are 
defined as any risk that could impact the 
three-year strategic business plan (“the 
plan”). They are assessed and if the 
impact is above a threshold, plotted on 

an enterprise risk heat map, based on 
probability and impact. Consideration 
is given to changes in the speed of 
potential impact and how principal risks 
influence other principal risks to help 
assess where key mitigations can have 
a greater effect on reducing overall risk 
to the business. Risks are also 
considered in combining events where 
a number of risks could occur together. 
This process is led across the Group 
by the IAG Management Committee 
supported by the ERM function. 

Although the Group considers enterprise 
risks that could impact the plan (defined 
as the short term), it also considers 
potential risks that could impact over 
the medium term of up to five years and 
in the longer term, beyond five years. 

Risk outcomes are quantified as the 
potential cash impact to the plan over 
three years. Non-cash outcomes that 
could impact our customers, employees, 
reputation, sustainability targets or our 
regulatory obligations are considered 
for every risk. 

Key controls and mitigations are 
documented, including appropriate 
response plans. Where risk treatments 
require time to implement, short-term 
mitigations are assessed and the 
timeline to risk mitigation and 
consequent risk acceptance discussed 
and agreed. 

Every principal risk has clear 
Management Committee oversight 
at the Group level and in each business.

Financial StatementsCorporate GovernanceStrategic ReportRisk management and principal risk factors continued

Emerging risks 
Where emerging risks and longer-term 
threats that the Group or the industry 
could face are identified, they are 
managed within the overall risk 
framework as “on watch” until they are 
re-assessed to be no longer a potential 
threat to the business or where an 
assessment of the risk impact over 
the plan period can be made, and 
appropriate mitigations can be put in 
place or the risk becomes a principal 
risk. Other high-impact, low-likelihood 
risks are also considered. 

Agility in risk management 
The Group’s ERM framework continues 
to adapt and evolve to the needs of the 
business and our stakeholders. This 
allows the Group and its businesses to 
both respond to changes in the external 
risk environment and support the pace 
and scale of business transformation, 
recognising the Board’s appetite for risk. 

During the year, management across the 
Group have reviewed the 
macroeconomic and geopolitical 
landscape to identify emerging risks and 
implications for existing principal risks as 

well as competition and market risk 
changes, particularly those that could 
impact operational resilience, our 
sustainability ambitions or the Group’s 
transformation, innovation and change 
agenda. By continuing to develop 
the Group’s assessment of the 
interdependencies of risks, using 
scenarios to quantify risk impact under 
different combinations and assumptions, 
and considering the risks within the 
Group’s risk environment that have 
increased or changed in their nature, 
either as a result of external factors or 
decisions within the Group’s businesses, 
its Board and management are better 
informed and can react more quickly. 

New guidance from regulators and 
investors is reviewed on an ongoing 
basis and best practice sought from 
other risk management sources. 

Viability assessment
The Board’s assessment of the viability 
of the Group is directly informed by the 
outputs of the ERM framework. Full 
details of our approach, scenarios 
modelled and the viability assessment 
are shown at the end of this report.

The IAG Board has overall 
responsibility for ensuring that 
the Group has an appropriate, 
robust and effective risk 
management framework.

Risk appetite

IAG has a risk appetite framework which 
includes statements informing the 
business, either qualitatively or 
quantitatively, of the Board’s appetite 
for certain risks. Each risk appetite 
statement applies either on a Group-
wide basis or for specific programmes, 
initiatives or activity within the Group. 

In the second half of 2022, the Board 
assessed its appetite across a number of 
critical strategic priorities to set 
tolerances for the Group for 2023. This 
approach allows tolerances to be set 
more dynamically across the plan period 
and aligns to the Group strategy as 
approved by the Board, which set the 
level of ambition and investment across 
the plan period. The exercise allowed the 
Board to discuss and consider the 
trade-offs within the plan and ensure 
that it was satisfied that management 
had set the appropriate prioritisation 
of initiatives to seek opportunities and 
manage risk within its defined appetite 
tolerances. This framework and 
tolerances have been in place 
throughout the year, with the Board 
assessing its appetite across all of the 
framework statements at year end 
against the Group’s performance and 
its anticipated delivery of the Board-
approved strategic business plan 
priorities and initiatives. 

The Board is satisfied that the Group 
continued to perform and deliver 
initiatives throughout 2023 as planned 
to mitigate risk as set out in its 
framework statements and where 
further action has been required, the 
Board has considered potential 
mitigations and, where appropriate or 
feasible, the Group has implemented or 
confirmed plans that would address 
those risks or retain them within the 
Board’s determined Group risk appetite.

In the second half of 2023, following the 
Board strategy review, the Board 
re-assessed its appetite for key risk 
areas, taking account of changes in the 
risk landscape since the prior year 
exercise, for the upcoming plan period.

Regular re-assessment and confirmation 
of the risk appetite of the Board ensures 
its relevance and ongoing alignment to 
the Group strategic priorities and allows 
the Group to take appropriate risks to 
deliver the plan.

Committee

IAG Board and Audit 
and Compliance 
Committee

Across the Group, risk owners 
are responsible for identifying 
potential risks and 
appropriately managing 
decisions within their area of 
responsibility that could 
impact business operations 
and delivery of the plan.

As the Group undertakes 
transformation activities within 
its operating companies, 
the pace and agility of the 
changes required create risks 
and opportunities. For 
transformational risks, 
business owners are assigned, 
and the business will agree 
appropriate mitigations and 
timelines for implementation, 
following discussions with all 
relevant stakeholders.

Emerging risks are assessed 
and risk owners consider and 
identify any potential impact 
to plans. Longer-term ‘on 
watch’ risks are subject to 
review as part of the 
framework.

Management is responsible for 
the effective operation of the 
internal controls and execution 
of the agreed risk mitigation 
plans.

Risk heat maps for each 
operating company and 
central functions are reviewed 
semi-annually by their 
operating company’s 
management committee or 
function leadership team.

Where the Group’s operating 
companies have a reliance on 
other parts of the Group for 
services delivery, risks are 
reflected appropriately across 
risk heat maps to ensure 
accountability is clear.

They escalate risks that have a 
Group impact or require Group 
consideration in line with the 
Group ERM framework.

They confirm to their 
operating company board and 
audit committees, where they 
exist, as to the identification, 
quantification and 
management of risks within 
their operating company at 
least annually.

Local risk heat maps are in 
place for subsidiary 
businesses, together with 
Group support platforms 
including Group Procurement 
and Services and IAG Tech.

The IAG Management 
Committee reviews risks 
during the year, including the 
Group risk heat map semi-
annually in advance of reviews 
by the Audit and Compliance 
Committee, in accordance 
with the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the 
Spanish Good Governance 
Code for Listed Companies.

At the year end, the IAG 
Management Committee 
reviews the performance of 
the Group during the full year 
against the risk appetite 
framework and reports any 
near tolerance or out of 
tolerance assessments to the 
Audit and Compliance 
Committee.

The IAG Management 
Committee recommends 
severe but plausible scenarios 
for stressing the strategic 
business plan as part of the 
annual Group viability 
assessment.

The IAG Board has overall 
responsibility for ensuring that 
the Group has an appropriate, 
robust and effective risk 
management framework, 
including the determination 
of the nature and extent 
of risk it is willing to take to 
achieve its strategic 
objectives.

The IAG Audit and 
Compliance Committee 
discusses risk and considers 
the risk environment regularly 
throughout the year, as does 
the IAG Board as part of wider 
Board discussions, in addition 
to the IAG Audit and 
Compliance Committee’s 
bi-annual risk heat map 
review, including a review of 
the assessment of the Group’s 
performance against its risk 
appetite for the financial year, 
scenarios for assessment of 
viability and the outputs from 
the viability modelling. The 
Audit and Compliance 
Committee has early sight of 
management consideration of 
viability scenarios to enable it 
to challenge subjectivities and 
confirm rationale. It then 
reviews the outputs at year 
end and makes 
recommendations on the 
viability assessment and 
statement to the Board.

The IAG Board reviews the 
Group’s risk heatmap annually 
and it has completed a robust 
assessment of the Group’s 
emerging and principal risks in 
the year. 

The IAG Board sets risk 
appetite for the plan period.

Enterprise Risk Management 
function 
The Enterprise Risk Management 
function provides support across the 
Group to ensure risk management 
processes are appropriately embedded 
and applied consistently, as well as 
working with management to identify 
risk, challenge assessments and 
strengthen the risk culture across the 

Group. The function provides risk 
management guidance and shares 
best practice across the Group and its 
operating companies, keeping them 
informed of any risk-related regulatory 
developments. The function is 
responsible for ensuring that the ERM 
framework remains agile and 
responsive to meet the needs of the 
business and its stakeholders.

The ERM function works with other 
compliance and Group functions, such 
as Group Finance, Government Affairs, 
Investor Relations, Legal, Ethics and 
Compliance, and Sustainability, 
leveraging their frameworks and 
assessments where appropriate. 
Risk assessments form an important 
input into the Internal Audit planning 
and delivery process.

Year in review

The highly regulated and commercially 
competitive environment, together with 
the businesses’ operational complexity, 
expose the Group to risks, where its 
influence and ability to directly manage 
the risks may be limited.

Examples include aircraft and 
component availability, and engine 
performance and reliability; the wider 
ongoing fundamental weaknesses in the 
resilience of the aviation sector’s supply 
chain; air traffic control (ATC) resilience 
and industrial unrest in third parties 
impacting operations; and policy 
measures taken by governments to 
address the economic environment or 
policy proposals that could impact the 
Group’s airlines’ ability to set capacity 
and/or pricing.

Other external threats which remain 
heightened include: the impact of 
inflation and interest rates on demand 
and customer confidence; higher costs 
in the supply chain; and the impact of 
escalating and ongoing geopolitical 
tensions and conflict in various regions 
impacting our customers and flight 
operations as well as creating further 
airspace restrictions.

In assessing its principal risks, the Group 
has considered its operational resilience 
across its businesses, the status of the 
financial markets, customer mix changes, 
political risk and government changes, 
including upcoming elections, pace of 
transformation, artificial intelligence (AI) 
adoption, the Group’s industrial relations 
landscape and people engagement and 
securing talent and expertise to support 
operations and deliver cultural change.

No new principal risks were identified 
through the risk discussions in the year. 
One risk has been reconsidered as part 
of the reviews and has been reframed 
as ‘Transformation, innovation and AI’ 
from ‘Transformation and change’ to 
recognise how the Group’s change 
agenda is underpinned by investment 
which will leverage innovation and AI 
tools to accelerate the delivery of 
customer-centric, efficient processes 
and tools to run our businesses. 

The risk around ‘Critical third parties in 
the supply chain’ is now assessed under 
Business and Operational risk given the 
nature of the potential impacts facing 
the Group (having previously been 
categorised as a Strategic risk).

Status

•  The Group’s brands are positioned in their 
respective markets to meet their customer 
propositions and deliver commercial value. Any 
change in engagement or travel preferences 
could impact the financial performance of the 
Group. 

•  IAG will continue to focus on its customer 

propositions to ensure competitiveness in its 
chosen priority customer demand spaces and to 
ensure that it adapts to meet changing customer 
expectations.

•  The Group is clear on the key levers to improve 
brand perception and satisfaction for each of its 
operating company brands.

The Group’s ability to attract and secure bookings and generate revenue 
depends on customers’ perception and affinity with the Group airlines’ 
brands and their associated reputation for customer service and value. The 
Group airlines’ brands are, and will continue to be, vulnerable to adverse 
publicity regarding events impacting service and operations. Operational 
resilience and customer satisfaction underpin customer trust. Reliability, 
including on-time performance (OTP), service and product delivery, are key 
elements of brand value and of each customer’s experience. Investment in 
cabin and service propositions helps ensure that our customers choose to 
fly with the Group’s airlines. 

The Group continues to improve its disruption management capabilities 
given the extent of the external disruption due to ATC and third-party 
resilience issues, particularly over engine reliability. IAG remains focused on 
strengthening its customer-centricity and all of the Group’s airlines continue 
to support their customers through any disruption including schedule 
adaptions where required. The Group continues to ensure that its operating 
companies continue to adapt and focus their business models, products and 
customer propositions to meet changing customer expectations and needs 
(including those with additional needs). Customer sentiment to travel and 
their expectations when they travel are intrinsic to brand health. The 
resilience and engagement of our people as customer service ambassadors 
to deliver excellent customer service is critical to retaining brand and 
customer trust.

Risk description

Mitigations

•  Erosion of the brand and customer trust through 

poor customer service or lack of reliability in 
operations, may adversely impact the Group’s 
leadership position with customers and 
ultimately affect future revenue and profitability.
•  If the Group is unable to meet the expectations 

of its customers and does not engage effectively 
to maintain their emotional attachment, then the 
Group may face brand erosion and loss of 
market share.

•  Failure to meet customer expectations on 
sustainability and the Group’s impact on 
stakeholders and society could impact the Group 
and its brands.

•  All IAG airlines are considered within the brand portfolio review.
•  Brand initiatives for each operating company have been identified and are 

aligned to the Group’s business plan.

•  Product investment to enhance the customer experience supports the 

brand propositions and is provided for in the plan.

•  All airlines track and report to IAG on their OTP and Net Promoter Score 

(NPS) to measure customer satisfaction.

•  Reviews of resilience, resourcing levels and schedule operability.
•  Enhanced disruption management tools within airlines to allow customers 

to manage their travel preferences.

•  Increased focus on the end-to-end customer journey from flight search 

through to arrival and baggage reclaim.

•  The Group’s global loyalty strategy builds customer loyalty within IAG 

airlines.

•  The Group’s focus on sustainability and sustainable aviation including the 

IAG climate change strategy to meet the target of net zero carbon 
emissions by 2050.

•  Robust portfolio process to determine the right investments across the 

Group.

•  Additional focus on customer feedback and proactive customer care.

Status 

•  The markets in which the Group operates are 
highly competitive. The Group faces direct 
competition on its routes, as well as from 
indirect flights, charter services and other 
modes of transport. Some competitors have 
other competitive advantages such as 
government support or benefits from insolvency 
protection.

•  Regulation of the airline industry covers many of 

the Group’s activities including route flying 
rights, airport landing rights, departure taxes, 
security and environmental controls. The 
Group’s ability to comply with and influence 
changes to regulations is key to maintaining 
operational and financial performance.

The demand environment in the year has seen the restoration of capacity 
into the market, with some markets exceeding pre-pandemic capacity levels. 
The distortionary effects of government policy and/or aviation-specific 
taxation or other regional or country-specific measures on the competitive 
landscape, continue to be assessed. The Group is investing in new fleet and 
products to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which its 
airlines operate. 

IAG supports the use of the Worldwide Airport Slots Guidelines system, 
formulated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), that 
encourages competition but also supports reliable, established networks. The 
Group responded to relevant consultations to inform regulators and to 
propose balanced regulation and avoid introducing additional rules that 
hamper the competitiveness of the industry.

In February 2023, IAG agreed the acquisition of the remaining 80% of Air 
Europa, subject to relevant regulatory approvals.

The Group continues to consult and keep different stakeholders informed 
over the impacts of government policies on aviation or policy asymmetry, 
such as increases in Air Passenger Duty (APD) or distortionary policies on 
carbon offsets.

Risk description

Mitigations

•  Competitor capacity growth in excess of 
demand growth could materially impact 
margins.

•  Any failure of a joint business or a joint business 

partner could adversely impact the Group’s 
airline business operations and financial 
performance.

•  Some of the markets in which the Group 

operates remain regulated by governments, in 
some instances controlling capacity and/or 
restricting market entry. Changes in such 
restrictions may have a negative impact on 
margins.

•  Regulatory or policy changes may create 

competitive distortion, impacting the Group’s 
airlines and their competitiveness or business 
model. 

•  The IAG Management Committee meets weekly and undertakes regular 

operating company-specific reviews. 

•  The Board discusses strategy throughout the year and dedicates two days 

per year to undertake a detailed review of the Group’s strategic plans. 

•  The Group strategy function supports the IAG Management Committee by 
identifying where resources can be devoted to exploit opportunities and 
accelerate change.

•  The airlines’ revenue management departments and systems optimise 
market share and yield through pricing and inventory management 
activity. 

•  The Group maintains rigorous cost control and targeted investment to 

remain competitive. 

•  The Group Procurement function reviews all critical contracts. 
•  The Group’s airlines are focused on customer-centricity and operational 

resilience. 

•  The portfolio of brands provides flexibility as capacity can be deployed at 

short notice as needed.

•  The IAG Management Committee regularly reviews market share and the 

commercial performance of joint business agreements.

•  The Group’s airlines review their relationships with business partners, 

supported where appropriate by the Group strategy function.

•  The Group’s Government Affairs function monitors government initiatives, 
represents the Group’s interest and forecasts likely changes to relevant 
laws and regulations and responds to consultations on regulatory change 
or policy that could impact the aviation industry or create competitive 
distortion.

Strategic relevance

Status 

•  IAG remains sensitive to political and economic 
conditions in the markets globally, particularly in 
our hub markets. All of the following can be 
influenced by political and economic change:

•  Business and leisure demand for travel;
•  Inflation impacts on the cost base;
•  Access to markets for new or existing routes; 
•  Increasing levels and costs of regulation;
•  Supply of products;
•  Availability of services and/or resource;
•  Ability to fly scheduled operations; and
•  Pricing and pricing over ancillaries.

The economic impact of geopolitical events coming after the energy crisis 
last winter, increases in commodity and wage costs from inflation and higher 
interest rates drive continued significant uncertainty over the economic 
outlook. The Group is closely reviewing the impacts of wage and supplier 
inflation on margins and customer demand. 

The re-opening of China at the beginning 2023 and removal of remaining 
restrictions in countries, post the pandemic, has simplified operations and the 
customer experience at airports. However ongoing conflicts, wars and 
heightened tensions across the Middle East further increase airspace 
restrictions and congestion for flows to Asia. 

Wider macroeconomic trends are being monitored such as a potential 
economic recession and tone of dialogue between the US, Russia, China and 
the EU and UK which can influence markets and result in imposition of 
misaligned policies or tariffs. The trend of increased nationalism and the 
potential impact to the Group is also kept under review. Recent supply chain 
disruptions have occurred in many markets and the level of disruption and 
potential impacts are considered across the Group. The Group also considers 
changes in government in key markets and the implications for trade, 
respective economic health and how governments view the aviation industry, 
with elections expected in the UK, Ireland and the US over the next year.

Developments in relevant international relationships, where they affect air 
services agreements to which the EU or UK are party, are monitored 
throughout the year and the Group’s positions advocated with the relevant 
national governments. Recent government proposals to set floor or ceiling 
caps on pricing, including the scope of ancillaries that airlines may be allowed 
to charge their customers for, may impact the ability to freely set pricing, sell 
ancillaries to meet customer needs and/or set capacity.

IAG has worked through trade associations, IATA, as well as national 
governments to put its case on issues of the importance of aviation to 
international trade and customer connectivity and the value that it brings. 

Any further macroeconomic trends or potential requirements arising from 
Brexit are monitored by the IAG Government Affairs function. 

Risk description

Mitigations

•  Economic deterioration or structural change in 

either a domestic market, key customer 
segment or the global economy may have a 
material impact on the Group’s financial position, 
while foreign exchange, fuel price and interest 
rate movements create volatility.

•  Failure to adequately plan for and be able to 

respond to uncertainty driven by geopolitical or 
market events or health-related concerns 
impacts the operations, costs and customers of 
the Group.

•  Changes in government may result in a change 
in sentiment to aviation and access to markets.

•  Government policy asymmetry impacting a 

domestic market could increase the burden of 
regulation and cost to our passengers.

•  The IAG Board and the IAG Management Committee review the financial 
outlook and business performance of the Group through the monthly 
trading results, financial planning process and the quarterly reforecasting 
process.

•  Reviews to assess and drive the Group’s financial performance through the 
management of capacity, together with appropriate cost control measures 
including the balance between fixed and variable costs, management of 
capital expenditure, and actions to improve liquidity. 

•  External economic outlook, fuel prices and exchange rates are carefully 

considered when developing strategy and plans and are regularly 
reviewed by the IAG Board and IAG Management Committee as part of 
business performance monitoring.

•  The Group’s Government Affairs function monitors government initiatives, 

represents the Group’s interest and gives the Group and its operating 
companies early sight of likely changes to laws and regulations. 

•  The Group engages with its regulators, governments and other political 
representatives and trade associations to help represent the views and 
contribution of the Group and aviation to society and economies.

•  The Group’s airlines have increased their focus on enhanced disruption 
management tools within airlines to increase operational resilience to 
restrictions e.g. capacity constraints at airports or health-related measures.

Strategic relevance

Status 

•  IAG is playing a leading role and working with 

industry to accelerate aviation decarbonisation. 
This means that environmental considerations 
are integrated into the business strategy at 
every level and the Group uses its influence to 
drive progress across the industry.

•  Our stakeholders and potential investors seek 

confirmation over our sustainability agenda and 
may link their purchasing, investment or lending 
decisions to our commitments and progress 
against them.

•  Our customers look to ensure that our airlines 
allow them to minimise their carbon footprint.

IAG is committed to a target of net zero carbon emissions across its 
operations and supply chain by 2050, along with 2030 targets. The 
Procurement function will have a key role to play in ensuring its delivery of 
the Scope 3 commitment for the Group with supplier sustainability ratings 
and sustainability clauses in supplier contracts key considerations for future 
contract negotiations and renewals. IAG has also committed to 10% 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage on average across its fleet by 2030. 

Plans implemented by the EU, UK and US governments to decarbonise 
aviation have resulted in fragmentation of policy measures and support 
offered by governments for green initiatives across the different regions in 
which the Group airlines operate. SAF infrastructure and availability lags 
demand, impacting the ability to achieve the aviation industry’s carbon 
reduction commitments. Mandates and other tax-based measures may 
disproportionately impact the Group’s airlines versus their competitors. All of 
the Group’s airlines have agreed new deals for the production of SAF to 
meet the Group’s target on the path to decarbonisation. Overall aviation 
industry requirements will require infrastructure investments across markets 
to support the production of SAF to meet demand expectations. 

The Group continues to model potential impacts and costs, which includes 
the removal of aviation jet fuel tax exemption, with mitigation plans 
embedded into strategic and financial planning.

IAG was an early adopter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines for climate-related scenario analysis and 
climate-specific risk assessments. The Group continues with its assessment 
of climate-related risks, by testing and revising the assumptions on updated 
forecasts for future business growth and the regulatory context and future 
carbon pricing. The Group has also embedded forecasting of its climate 
impacts into its strategic, business and financial planning processes and has 
assessed that it is resilient to material climate-related impacts.

Risk description

Mitigations

•  Increasing global concern about climate change 
and the impact of carbon affects Group airlines’ 
performance as customers seek alternative 
methods of transport or reduce their levels of 
travel.

•  New taxes, the potential removal of aviation jet 
fuel exemptions and increasing price of carbon 
allowances impact on price and demand. 
Customers may choose to reduce the amount 
they fly.

•  IAG climate change strategy to meet target of net zero carbon emissions 

by 2050.

•  Annual incentive plans link manager bonuses to annual carbon intensity 

targets.

•  All of the Group’s airlines have platforms for customers to contribute 

towards mitigating their flight emissions over time, including contributing 
towards SAF or projects which remove carbon from the atmosphere.
•  Embedded climate impacts into the financial statements, balance sheet, 

financial forecasting and other relevant disclosures.

•  IAG investment in SAF with operating companies continuing to secure 

•  The airline industry is subject to increased 

mid- and long-term supply agreements. 

regulatory requirements and policy asymmetry 
driving costs, distortion and operational 
complexity, as well as the potential for sub-
optimal outcomes for the planet. 

•  Demand exceeds supply to meet sustainable 

fuel mandates or infrastructure and production 
is not available in the markets the Group airlines 
serve.

•  SAF policy fragmentation results in different 

in-scope allowances across markets, distorting 
the competitive environment and levels of 
carbon costs.

•  Increasing severity of weather events results in 

operational and customer disruption.

•  IAG actively monitors the delivery of SAF procured.
•  Fleet replacement plan is introducing aircraft into the fleet that are more 

carbon efficient.

•  Reporting on sustainability performance in the IAG supply chain to better 

mitigate supply chain-related sustainability risks.

•  Partnering with ZeroAvia to explore hydrogen-powered aircraft 

technology.

•  Participating in CORSIA, the ICAO global aviation carbon offsetting 
scheme and the EU-ETS and UK-ETS emission trading schemes.

•  Horizon scanning for potential partners and technology.
•  Engagement across UK, EU and global trade associations to shape 
effective climate policy and drive support for low-carbon solutions.

Strategic relevance

Status 

•  Any sub-optimal service delivery or asset 

supplied by a critical supplier can impact on the 
Group airlines’ operational and financial 
performance as well as disrupting our customers 
and impacting our brand and reputation.
•  Infrastructure decisions or changes in policy 
by governments, regulators or other entities 
could impact operations but are outside 
the Group’s control.

•  London Heathrow has no spare runway capacity.
•  An uncontrolled increase in the planned cost 
of expansion of a hub airport, particularly 
London Heathrow, could result in increased 
landing charges making the airport 
uncompetitive versus other European hubs.

•  Airport charges represent a significant 
operating cost to the airlines and have 
an impact on operations.

•  Inflationary cost pressures within the supply 

chain may increase the cost of travel.

The aviation sector continues to be affected by global supply chain 
disruption which has impacted aircraft deliveries, engine and component 
availability and reliability, resource availability and/or threat of employee 
industrial action in critical third parties and airport services, the level of 
resilience of airports, particularly London Heathrow, and ATC capability and 
restrictions. In August, a failure of UK national ATC services impacted flight 
operations across the UK. 

The Group proactively assesses its schedules for operability and continues to 
work with all critical suppliers to understand any potential disruption within 
their supply chains from either a shortage of available resource, strike action 
or production delays which could impact the availability of new fleet, engines 
or critical goods or services. Delays in new aircraft and spare engines, and 
technical performance issues requiring additional maintenance continue to 
impact operations and turnaround times for aircraft. This has led to increased 
costs to secure such services. Focus has been placed on key suppliers given 
the inflationary environment impacting wages and costs of goods, to 
understand any business or operational continuity impacts, and where 
possible identify other suitable suppliers. The Group has been impacted by 
reliability and performance of GTF engines, which is mitigated with 
replacement aircraft and remedy support from the engine manufacturer. 

Many elements of the supply chain remain outside of the Group’s ability to 
directly manage, including aircraft deliveries and availability of components, 
airport performance and ATC resilience.

The Group continues to consult stakeholders and raise awareness of the 
negative impacts of ATC airspace restrictions and performance issues on the 
aviation sector and economies across Europe, particularly with the capacity 
recovery and continued closure of airspace driven by geopolitical events. 
The Group relies on the provision of airport infrastructure and is dependent 
on the timely delivery of appropriate facilities. The Group continues to 
challenge unreasonable levels of increases in airport charges, especially at 
London Heathrow.

Risk description

Mitigations

•  The Group mitigates engine and fleet performance risks, including delays to 
delivery and unacceptable levels of carbon emissions, to the extent possible 
by working closely with the engine and fleet manufacturers, as well as 
retaining flexibility with existing aircraft return requirements and aircraft 
lessors. 

•  The Group engages in regulatory reviews of supplier pricing, such as the 

UK Civil Aviation Authority’s periodic review of charges at London Heathrow 
and London Gatwick airports.

•  The Group is active at an EU policy level and in consultations with airports 

covered by the EU Airport Charges Directive.

•  The Group proactively works with suppliers to ensure operations are 

maintained and the impact to their businesses understood, with mitigations 
implemented where necessary and inflation minimised. 

•  The Group Procurement function has oversight of all critical contracts 

across the Group’s businesses. 

•  Alternative suppliers are identified where feasible.
•  Transformation initiatives to offset inflation.

•  IAG is dependent on the timely entry of new 

aircraft and the engine performance of aircraft 
to improve operational efficiency and resilience 
and meet the commitments of the Group 
sustainability programme.

•  IAG is dependent on the timely, on-budget 

delivery of infrastructure changes, particularly 
at key airports.

•  IAG is dependent on resilience within the 

operations of ATC services to ensure that its 
flight operations are delivered as scheduled.

•  IAG is dependent on the performance and costs 

of critical third-party suppliers that provide 
services to our customers and the Group such 
as airport operators, border control and 
caterers. Increases in costs or where suppliers 
face ongoing financial stress or restructuring 
where they exit the market for supply of 
services may impact the Group’s operations.

•  IAG is dependent on the availability and 

production of alternative fuels to meet its 
carbon commitments. This may require 
investments in infrastructure in the markets 
in which the Group operates.

•  The cyber threat environment remains 

challenging for all organisations, including the 
airline industry. Cyber threat actors, criminals, 
foreign governments and hacktivists have the 
capacity and motivation to attack the airline 
industry for financial gain and other political 
or social reasons.

•  The fast-moving nature of this risk means 
that the Group will always retain a level 
of vulnerability.

The risks from cyber threats continue as threat actors seek to exploit any 
weaknesses in defences particularly through social engineering and human 
behaviours. The threat of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and services 
remains high and increased in the year with heightened geopolitical tensions, with 
the Group exposed to threat actors targeting IAG, its operating companies and its 
suppliers. The Group continues to improve its cybersecurity posture either through 
major IT transformational change or additional monitoring through tools.

In the first half of the year, some of the Group’s businesses were impacted by an 
attack on a third-party services provider holding employee data. The Group is 
focused on improving its cybersecurity posture and better understanding the risk 
presented by its suppliers.

The regulatory regimes associated with data and infrastructure security are also 
becoming more complex with different regulators applying different framework 
approaches and guidance for reporting. The Group airlines are subject to the 
requirements of privacy legislation such as GDPR and the National Information 
Security Directive (NISD). 

The emergence and usage of AI to bypass cybersecurity controls, produce 
phishing emails and malware has also accelerated attempts to access 
organisations’ systems and data and increases the threat and scale of social 
engineering attacks.

Investment in cybersecurity systems and controls continues as planned, although 
addressing the risk is also dependent on business capacity and the delivery 
of solutions to address technical obsolescence within IAG Tech. All planned 
investment is linked to a Group-wide maturity assessment based on the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework, a leading 
industry standard benchmark. Data centre migration activity to the cloud across 
the Group’s airlines will further help to improve the security controls environment. 
As the Group improves its security posture and maturity, it better understands 
the rapid nature of potential attack vectors and how to detect them.

Risk description

Mitigations

•  The Group could face financial loss, 

disruption or damage to brand reputation 
arising from an attack on the Group’s 
systems by criminals, foreign governments 
or hacktivists.

•  If the Group does not adequately protect 

customer and employee data, it could breach 
regulations and face penalties and loss 
of customer trust.

•  The Group has a Board-approved cyber strategy that drives investment and 

operational planning.

•  A cyber risk management framework ensures the risk is reviewed across all 

operating companies.

•  The IAG Cyber Governance board assesses the portfolio of projects quarterly 

and each operating company reviews its own portfolio at least quarterly.
•  The IAG Chief Information, Procurement, Services and Innovation Officer 

(CIPSIO) provides assurance and expertise around strategy, policy, training 
and security operations for the Group. 

•  Changes in working practices and 

•  Detection tools and monitoring are in place. The Group-wide security

control environment.

engineering and operations teams proactively seek to identify and respond to 
threats and vulnerabilities, including ongoing testing of the Group’s defences.
•  External attack surface monitoring and threat intelligence is used to analyse 

cyber risks to the Group.

•  External benchmarking on cyber posture with independent assessment in the 

year by a specialist third party.

•  Regular cyber awareness training run by the operating companies, including 

annual mandatory training on cyber risk and data protection for all staff.

•  Oversight of critical systems and suppliers to ensure that the Group understands 

the data it holds, that it is secure, and regulations are adhered to.

•  Data Protection Officers are in place in all operating companies, coordinated 

through a Group-wide Privacy Steering Group.

•  Working practices reviewed to ensure integrity of cyber and data security.
•  All suppliers must adhere to IAG security requirements. A Group-wide 

third-party risk management process integrates cybersecurity due diligence 
into contracting processes to monitor supplier security performance.

•  Security architecture team embedded into Datacentre migrations programmes.
•  Desktop and simulated exercises to test business response plans.

Strategic relevance

Status 

•  IAG is dependent on IT systems for most key 

business processes. Increasingly, the integration 
within IAG’s supply chain means that the Group 
is also dependent on the performance of 
suppliers’ IT infrastructure, e.g. airport 
baggage operators.

•  Competitors and new entrants to the travel 

market may use digital tools, innovate or use 
AI and technology more effectively and disrupt 
the Group’s business model.

The Group recognises the importance of technology to business 
transformation and growth. The CIPSIO works with the Group’s operating 
companies to ensure appropriate prioritisation and investment in the Group’s 
digital and IT transformation. Both are members of the IAG Management 
Committee. 

The Group continues to review its IT operating model as it progresses with 
digitalisation, migration to the cloud from on-premises data centres, 
remediation and transformation of its networks and addressing 
obsolescence. It has moved more resources into product teams more closely 
aligned to business needs. The Group is reliant upon the resilience of its 
systems and networks for key customer and business processes and is 
exposed to risks that relate to poor performance, vulnerability or failure of 
these systems. The Group continues with major programmes and upgrades 
to modernise, including new commercial capabilities and customer-centric 
enhancements using agile-based models, as well as replacing core IT 
infrastructure and improving network connectivity and redundancy. 
Mitigating actions that prioritise operational stability and resilience have been 
built into all cutover plans for the go-live of IT systems-related changes. This 
has strengthened the Group’s operating companies’ focus on addressing 
their legacy estates to deliver digital customer experiences. The CIPSIO 
works with the operating companies to ensure that their IT investment and 
requirements are appropriately prioritised and delivered, value to the Group 
from IT investment is maximised and central services can support the 
Group’s businesses appropriately.

Risk description

Mitigations

•  The dependency on IT systems and networks 
for key business and customer processes is 
increasing and the failure of a critical system 
may cause significant disruption to the 
operation and lost revenue.

•  The level of transformational change at pace 
required by the Group’s airlines may result in 
disruption to operations as the legacy 
environment is addressed.

•  Obsolescence within the IAG Tech estate could 
result in service outages and/or operational 
disruption or delays in implementation of the 
Group’s transformation.

•  Technology disruptors may use tools to position 

themselves between our brands and our 
customers.

•  IAG Tech works with the Group operating companies to deliver digital and 

IT change initiatives to enhance security and stability.

•  Operating companies’ IT governance boards are in place to review delivery 

timelines.

•  Reversion plans are developed for migrations on critical IT infrastructure.
•  System controls, disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements 

exist to mitigate the risk of a critical system failure.

•  Robust portfolio process to determine the right investments across 

the Group.

•  IAG Tech CIPSIO and operating company management committee 

members have strategic relationships with all critical IT suppliers and 
oversight of all critical IT contracts across the Group’s businesses. 

•  The Group continues to develop platforms such as the New Distribution 
Capability, changing distribution arrangements and moving from indirect 
to direct channels.

•  IAG Tech continues to create early engagement and leverages new 

opportunities with start-ups and technology disruptors.

Strategic relevance

Status 

•  The Group’s airlines may be disrupted by 

a number of different events. 

•  A single prolonged event, or a series of events 

in close succession, impact on the Group airlines’ 
operational capability, financial status and brand 
strength.

•  The Group needs to adhere to local 

governments’ restrictions and regulations, 
especially related to safety and public health, 
and is therefore sensitive to any consequential 
impact on demand.

The Group is reliant on critical third parties for services and goods, many of 
which have been impacted by resourcing challenges, inflation and supply 
chain disruption. Ongoing labour shortages, particularly for technical licensed 
staff, industrial unrest and strike action in the aviation sector combined with 
goods availability shortages in the supply chain, especially engines, and 
airspace and ATC restrictions can all impact the operational environment and 
the customer experience of the Group’s airlines and increase the costs of 
running operations to provide additional resilience, as well as impacting the 
costs and operations of the businesses on which the Group relies. 

The Group continues with its ambitious IT infrastructure transformation 
agenda to modernise and digitalise its IT estates. The Group is focused on 
minimising any unplanned outages or disruption to customers with additional 
resilience built into the airlines’ networks.

The Group continues to consider and build its resilience to withstand severe 
unexpected stresses. Potential high-impact, low-likelihood events have been 
considered that could have the potential to disrupt IAG and/or the aviation 
sector. Many of these events remain outside the Group’s control such as 
adverse weather, another pandemic, civil unrest or a terrorist event seen 
in cities served by the Group’s airlines.

Risk description

Mitigations

•  Management has business continuity plans to mitigate this risk to the 
extent feasible, with focus on operational and financial resilience and 
customer and colleague safety and recovery.

•  The Group’s airlines have standby aircraft and crew in place to improve 

resilience.

•  Resilience to minimise the impact of ATC airspace restrictions and strike 

action on the Group’s customers and operations is in place.

•  All of the Group’s airlines are focused on developing customer disruption 

management tools to help our customers in times of disruption.

•  An event causing significant network disruption 

or the inability to promptly recover from 
short-term disruptions may result in lost 
revenue, customer disruption and additional 
costs to the Group. 

•  Public health concerns impacting populations 
at scale could see an adverse effect on the 
Group where governments choose to impose 
restrictions, as would any future pandemic 
outbreak, or other material event impacting 
operations or customers' ability to travel.

•  The Group’s airlines may not be able to resource 
their operations sufficiently resulting in impacts 
to customers and brands.

•  The Group’s airlines are reliant on critical third 

parties to deliver goods and services to maintain 
operations and meet customer expectations and 
any failure of the level of service or reliability 
and delivery of goods may impact operational 
resilience and our customers.

Strategic relevance

Status 

•  The Group has a large unionised workforce with 
around 87% of colleagues represented by one 
of a number of different trade unions under 
collective bargaining agreements (CBA). IAG 
relies on the successful agreement of collective 
bargaining arrangements across its operating 
companies to operate its airlines.

•  The right skillsets and culture are needed to 

transform our businesses at pace. 

•  The Group’s airlines require specialist skillsets 

to continue to operate.

Our people, their engagement, cultural appetite and mindset for change are 
critical to the Group’s current performance and future success. Our 
leadership recognises the efforts of our staff and their commitment through 
the continued operational challenges facing our airlines. Resource shortages 
in crew have been addressed and our businesses are building the knowledge 
and experience of their new starters and managing the cultural impacts of 
onboarding at scale to ensure they have the right capabilities to operate. 
Shortages in technical licensed staff across the aviation sector and in the 
Group airlines may impact maintenance delivery timelines unless resource 
levels can be secured. 

Across the Group, collective bargaining is in place with various unions. 
Where agreements are open, our operating companies continue to engage 
in discussions with unions to secure sustainable agreements and address 
concerns arising within the negotiations. In September, AENA announced 
the result of its competitive tender for ground handling licences at airports 
across Spain, which resulted in the loss of key airports to another provider, 
with unions for Iberia ground handling services taking strike action in January 
2024. Iberia plans to create a new handling company, which will provide 
handling services and all airport staff affected by the AENA decision will be 
moved to the new company, with a new sector CBA and conditions for 
existing Iberia employees.

The Group is focused on staff wellbeing and people morale and motivation, 
including supporting agile and hybrid working models. Welfare support 
schemes are in place to support the Group’s staff, and initiatives to build 
trust and engagement continue across the Group’s businesses. The Group 
has identified the skills and capabilities that are required to manage its 
transformation, which include enhancing its leadership capability and 
delivering on the Group’s diversity and inclusion plans. All operating 
companies recognise the critical role that their employees will play in the 
transformation and future success of the Group and they are focusing on 
improving organisational health and employee engagement. 

Risk description

Mitigations

•  Any breakdowns in the bargaining process 
with the unionised workforces may result in 
subsequent strike action which may disrupt 
operations and adversely affect business 
performance and customer perceptions 
of the airlines.

•  Our people are not engaged, or they do not 
display the required leadership or cultural 
behaviours. 

•  The Group businesses fail to attract, motivate, 
retain or develop our people to deliver service 
and brand experience. 

•  Critical skillsets are not in place to execute on 
the required transformation plan or to exploit 
innovation and AI opportunities and drive the 
business forward.

•  Technical licensed staff, including pilots 

and engineers, may be impacted by Brexit 
recruitment restrictions.

•  Ongoing information sharing, consultation and collective bargaining with 
unions across the Group take place on a regular basis led by operating 
companies’ human resources specialists, who have a strong skillset in 
industrial relations.

•  Ensuring that remuneration is aligned to local markets in terms of 

productivity and pay.

•  Operating companies’ people strategies are in place in our businesses.
•  Succession planning within and across operating companies has been 

reviewed by the IAG Management Committee and Board and a consistent 
process is being implemented across the Group.

•  Focus on recruiting and developing skills to run and transform our business.
•  The Group is investing in apprentice programmes and retention initiatives to 

help secure and retain engineers.

•  Operating companies’ engagement and organisational health surveys have 

been conducted with subsequent action plans developed to create 
a positive and inclusive culture.

•  Access to support individuals’ wellbeing.
•  IAG Code of Conduct is supported by annual awareness programmes 

and mandatory training for all of our staff.

Mitigations

•  A failure to prevent or respond effectively 
to a major safety or security incident or 
intelligence may adversely impact the Group’s 
brands, operations and financial performance.

•  The corresponding safety committees of each of the airlines of the Group 

satisfy themselves that they have the appropriate resources and procedures, 
which include compliance with Air Operator Certificate requirements.

•  The Group’s airlines have comprehensive training and maintenance 

programmes in place, supported by a just culture environment, where 
everyone is accountable for their actions and their performance is reflective 
of the knowledge, behaviours and skills they have.

•  There is ongoing security engagement with airports, regulators and public 

authorities across the airlines’ networks.

•  Incident centres respond in a structured way in the event of a safety 

or security incident or intelligence.

Status 

•  The transformation, innovation and AI agenda 

is critical to the Group’s ability to deliver strong 
returns and to compete in the new competitive 
marketplace, where distortionary effects of 
aviation support schemes may have allowed 
competitors to accelerate their change agendas 
and invest to improve capabilities and customer 
propositions.

The Group has an established Transformation Programme Management 
Office which has oversight of an agreed portfolio of initiatives across the 
Group focused on improving customer service, revenue and cost efficiency 
and the transformation mindset is becoming part of our culture. Many of the 
programmes are multi-year and all are subject to the ongoing review and 
investment approvals of the IAG Board. In the year, the Group established an 
AI governance committee and guidance for data usage in respect to AI tools 
and technology.

Risk description

Mitigations

•  The Chief Transformation and Corporate Development Officer has clear 

oversight of all programmes across the Group’s businesses.

•  Mirrored structures in the operating companies.
•  Consistent core metrics and dashboard reporting used to assess 

performance against plan.

•  The IAG Management Committee has regular operating company-specific 
meetings to assess their transformation agenda and the risks to delivery.

•  The Group transformation agenda is subject to Board approval and progress 

is regularly monitored by the Board.

•  Group AI governance committee to assess AI initiatives to allow the Group 

businesses to exploit AI capabilities.

•  There is operating company-led communications to our employees 

on change initiatives and changes that may affect them.

•  Consideration is given to the Group’s sustainability commitments 

and agenda for all programmes.

•  Any potential changes that could impact the brands are reviewed 

to mitigate against reputational and brand damage.

•  Failure to transform the business to effectively 
deliver cost efficiency initiatives, maintain or 
grow share in the new competitive environment, 
fully implement all programmes across the 
Group and realise the benefits of the change 
initiatives to deliver Group digital platforms 
and customer propositions.

•  The pace of change may expose the Group to 

execution risk as multiple initiatives are delivered 
across processes and systems that serve our 
operations and customers. 

•  The impact on our people of the wide-ranging 

change agenda if poorly managed or 
uncoordinated could lead to logistical and 
engagement challenges with the potential 
to negatively impact NPS, revenue and 
efficiency benefits.

•  Further standardisation, simplification and 
efficiencies of the Group platforms are not 
delivered.

•  Competitors, or new entrants, may invest 

and innovate deploying digital technologies, 
AI, sustainability initiatives and/or platforms 
ahead of the Group.

•  The levels of data capture, data storage and 

security and availability of data, are not 
sufficient and ready to exploit AI use cases.

Strategic relevance

Status 

•  The Group’s ability to finance ongoing 

operations, committed aircraft orders, future 
fleet growth plans or acquisitions is vulnerable 
to various factors including financial market 
conditions, financial institutions’ appetite for 
secured aircraft financing and the financial 
market’s perceptions of the future resilience and 
cash flows of the Group.

Access to the secured and unsecured debt markets may be disrupted by 
geopolitical and economic uncertainty, impacting funding options and 
interest rates available to the Group for new aircraft financing or where it 
chooses to re-finance debt. Interest rate increases implemented by central 
banks in 2023 to address inflation increase the cost for the Group of existing 
floating rate debt, as well as for new financing. As at 31 December 2023 
approximately 13% of the Group’s debt, including hedges, was floating rate as 
the Group has paid down a substantial part of its floating debt in 2023. The 
Group successfully raised financing for all aircraft deliveries it sought to 
finance during 2023, using traditional long-term aircraft financing 
arrangements. The Group’s credit rating with Standard & Poors was 
upgraded to investment grade (BBB-) during the year, whilst its rating with 
Moody’s was increased by one notch to Ba1. In December, Fitch upgraded 
British Airways to BB- investment grade.

Risk description

Mitigations

•  Failure to finance ongoing operations, 

committed aircraft orders, future fleet growth 
plans, business acquisitions and third-party 
financial guarantees.

•  New financial arrangements, in addition to 

the repayment of existing arrangements, may 
impact plans to transform the Group and will 
influence the timing for IAG to resume paying 
dividends to its shareholders.

•  Higher interest rates in the market, or more 

restrictive terms, for new finance arrangements 
or re-financing may impact the Group’s cost 
base.

•  The IAG Board and Management Committee review the Group’s financial 

position and financing strategy regularly.

•  The Group has maintained its clear focus on managing liquidity and ensuring 

that critical investment in the Group is maintained. 

•  During 2023, the Group extended the availability for $1,655 million of its 

$1,755 million revolving credit facility by one year to March 2026.

•  Maintain strong relationship with banks, lenders and lessors.
•  Scenario planning for different financial environments.
•  Continuous review of capital structure to minimise interest rate exposure 

and lower cost of capital.

Status 

•  The volatility in the price of oil and petroleum 
products can have a material impact on the 
Group’s operating results.

•  The volatility in currencies other than the 

airlines’ local currencies can have a material 
impact on the Group’s operating results, 
particularly the US dollar. 

•  Higher interest rates can have a material impact 

on the Group’s operating results.

•  The Group is exposed to non-performance of 
ﬁnancial contracts that may result in financial 
losses.

Fuel cost volatility driven by geo-political events has been partly mitigated 
by the Group’s fuel hedging policy. Access to fuel hedging instruments or the 
ability to pass increased fuel costs on to consumers could impact the 
Group’s profits. The Group continues to assess the strength of the US dollar 
against the euro and pound sterling and the potential impacts on the Group’s 
operating results. All airlines hedge currency risk in line with the Group 
hedging policy. 

The approach to fuel risk management, financial risk management, interest 
rate risk management, proportions of fixed and floating debt management 
and financial counterparty credit risk management and the Group’s exposure 
by geography continue to be assessed to ensure the Group responds to the 
rapidly changing financial environment appropriately. Details are set out in 
the Group financial statements.

•  Fuel price risk is partially hedged through the purchase of oil and oil 
distillates derivatives in accordance with the Group risk appetite.
•  Currency risk is hedged through matching inflows and outflows and 

managing the surplus or shortfall through foreign exchange derivatives.
•  All airlines review routes to countries with exchange controls to monitor 
delays in the repatriation of cash and/or with the risk of material local 
currency devaluation.

•  The impact of interest rate changes on floating debt positions is mitigated 
through interest rate derivatives as well as structuring selected new debt 
and lease deals at fixed rates throughout their term.

•  The Group has a financial counterparty credit limit allocation by airline and 
by type of exposure and monitors the financial and counterparty risk on 
an ongoing basis.

•  The IAG Management Committee and the IAG Audit and Compliance 

Committee regularly review the financial risks and the hedged amounts. 
Any material position outside policy limits has to be approved by the IAG

Viability assessment

Longer-term trends 
and risk considerations

Risk assessment across 
the timeline of the plan

Viability scenario process

When considering the viability of the 
Group, for the purposes of this report, 
the directors have evaluated the risk 
landscape facing the Group and 
recommended plausible but severe 
downside scenarios that could impact 
the Group’s three-year plan to determine 
the Group’s resilience to such impacts. 

The results of these scenarios on the 
plan have been presented both pre 
and post an assessment of the likely 
effectiveness of the mitigations that 
management reasonably believes would 
be available over this period (and not 
already reflected in the plan).

The directors have assessed key threats 
and trends faced by the industry, 
emerging risks and opportunities, as well 
as other industry and Group-specific 
risks that could impact the Group’s 
business plan:

•  these are considered in light of their 
impact on our business model and 
relevance, operations, customers and 
financial status and include changes in 
regulations, customer trends and 
behaviours, macroeconomic 
predictions on growth, regional 
market opportunities, technology 
trends, environmental implications and 
infrastructure developments that 
could impact our operations, as well 
as more existential threats to aviation;

•  when developing the Group’s three-
year business plan, longer-term 
considerations have been assessed by 
the IAG Management Committee and 
the Board in conjunction with the 
priorities of and risks faced by the 
business; and

•  the Board has also conducted its 

annual strategy session in addition 
to regular performance and strategy 
delivery progress reviews during the 
year. Following this process, short-, 
medium- and longer-term priorities, 
challenges and opportunities have 
been identified and actions agreed.

The directors have assessed key threats 
and trends, and emerging risks and 
opportunities, to determine plausible 
but severe downside scenarios that 
could impact the Group’s three-year 
business plan.

The directors have assessed industry, 
Group-specific and non sector-specific 
longer-term trends over a timeframe 
beyond the plan period, such as climate 
change regulation, infrastructure proposals 
at hubs, availability and timing of 
technologies in fleet, move to and 
exploitation of the cloud, AI and disruptive 
innovation tools. These trends may require 
the business to consider strategic 
responses, business model adaptions and 
new skillsets ahead of any potential impact 
to the Group plan.

Other considerations include:

•  economic trends and shifts in the relative 
strengths of global economies including 
rise of emerging markets and hubs, 
market shifts and interconnectivity 
including partnerships and alliances, the 
competitive landscape and changes in 
customer mix or sentiment to travel;

•  supply chains and proximity and 
reliability of supply, inflationary, 
resource and availability pressures on 
key suppliers;

•  costs of compliance to environmental 

and climate change regulations and/or 
lack of availability of infrastructure 
within countries to meet commitments 
or government mandates;

•  increasing regulatory burdens, 

asymmetry in policy and/or government 
intervention impacting aviation and the 
Group’s business model;

•  areas of risk or opportunity for the 

Group, such as workforce availability, 
migration, war for talent, impact of 
AI on business and skillsets, outcomes 
of mis- and dis-information, diversity 
and inclusion ambitions, hybrid ways 
of working and different career 
expectations from new joiners into 
workforces and the aviation industry;

•  structural changes in how 

customers travel; 

•  the potential macroeconomic 

consequences of interest rates and 
inflation especially where there are 
labour shortages in key markets or 
a shortage of technical specialists;
•  the potential longer-term impacts 

of Brexit and the UK’s divergence from 
EU policy and laws;

•  the Group’s resilience to future events 
impacting aviation or global markets, 
financial markets, interest rates and 
exchange rates, particularly the US 
dollar; and

•  stakeholder expectations over 

commitment to acting with integrity 
to protect our planet, particularly 
climate change and carbon impacts.

Financial StatementsCorporate GovernanceStrategic ReportRisk management and principal risk factors continued

Scenarios modelled

The scenarios have been defined 
by management and designed 
to consider principal risks (or 
combinations of risks) that could 
materialise over the viability period and 
weaken the Group’s liquidity position, 
and therefore its financial sustainability. 
Each scenario is regarded as severe but 
also plausible and has considered the 
impact on liquidity, solvency and the 
ability to raise financing in an uncertain 
and volatile environment.

Management has also assessed 
mitigations that are available to the 
business beyond operating cost 
reductions including further financing, 
capital expenditure plans and potential 
disposals. Options are presented, as 
appropriate, for the Board to assess. In 
reviewing and approving the scenarios, 
the Board considered, amongst other 
matters, the availability and sufficiency 
of potential mitigations, the expected 
speed of implementation in response to 
the uncertainty and the future flexibility 
required for the Group to adapt further 
as needed.

Sensitivities in the scenarios’ 
assumptions have been highlighted by 
management and challenged by the 
Board. In addition, the Board reviewed 
the results of revenue and margin 
reverse stress tests, which demonstrated 
the level of sustained passenger revenue 
decline, and, separately, margin decline 
before mitigations, that would result in 
the Group using all available liquidity 
(including cash and currently available 
undrawn credit facilities) and compared 
this to the outputs from the scenarios.

No. Title
1

Downside case

This scenario configures a blend of commercial and operational adverse impacts which would result in capacity 
reductions, in addition to an increase in fuel prices, over and above the Group’s business plan assumptions. 

Economic considerations include a combination of events reducing capacity up to a maximum of 25%, 
increasing fuel prices up to 20%, reducing passenger unit revenue and increased operational costs. 

The Downside case assumes that British Airways would be required to draw down, in full, its portion of the 
available US dollar Revolving Credit Facility. The Downside case also builds in a downside impact in Air Europa 
Holdings, which the Group plans to acquire in the plan period, subject to regulatory approval.

The period to June 2025 of this Downside case has also been applied as the Downside case in the going 
concern analysis (see note 2 of the Group financial statements).

2 Operational resilience challenges

Lost revenue within some IAG airlines from pre-emptive flight cancellations in response to resourcing 
challenges with resultant reputational impact.

Ongoing challenges in the global supply chain, particularly engine availability, reliability and performance leads 
to an increase in grounded aircraft awaiting maintenance with further capacity reductions also impacting 
revenues. Revenues from the Group’s maintenance business also impacted by the lack of available spare parts.

Further revenue impact considered from reduced capacity as a result of airport capacity and air traffic control 
airspace restrictions.

Revenue impact from schedule disruption due to extreme weather events also considered within the scenario.

3 Cybersecurity and IT infrastructure

A stress to model the impact of a ransomware attack on an IAG airline. The scenario assumes a disruption 
period of five days resulting from the attack before full connectivity is restored, impacting customers and 
operations of the affected airline. It also assumes lost revenue due to disruption of operations at the affected 
airline with knock-on impacts to other IAG airlines due to the need to isolate and switch off connectivity of 
Group shared credentials platforms. There are also further lost revenues due to reputational impact and 
increased EU 261 and other customer goodwill costs. Associated costs of recovery from the incident include 
the disruption through the investigation period including increased IT costs as well as brand impacts, and the 
potential for regulatory scrutiny and fines.

In addition, the scenario considers an unplanned outage owing to data centre migration activity resulting in 
short notice flight cancellations causing further lost revenue and increased EU 261 and other customer goodwill 
costs.

4 Sustainability and business transformation

An increasing revenue stress on short-haul operations across the Group to reflect changes in customer 
behaviours towards short-haul travel where other travel options exist.

1, 4, 11 

Increased carbon costs and sustainable fuel costs to meet mandates and where supply cannot be secured. Revenues 
in key markets below plan expectations also modelled to reflect a potential long-term change in mix and travel 
behaviours.

Potential for lost revenue impact arising from delays in delivering and realising the benefits of business 
transformation initiatives and increased costs of securing required resourcing levels.

Longer-term consideration of the impacts of climate change and carbon and regulatory initiatives to address 
this within the aviation sector, such as the implementation of new regulatory policy, carbon costs and the cost 
and availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel are also subject to assessment and modelling by the Group in 
addition to the viability scenario assessments.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Viability statement

The directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over three years to 
December 2026. They have considered 
the global macroeconomic environment 
and geopolitical uncertainty, the health 
of the aviation industry and its supply 
chain, the assumptions of the plan, the 
strategy of the Group and the Board’s 
risk appetite. Although the prospects of 
the Group are considered over a longer 
period, the directors have determined 
that a three-year period is an 
appropriate timeframe for assessment 
as it is aligned with the Group’s strategic 
planning period (as reflected in the 
plan), and as the external uncertainties 
facing the aviation sector continue to be 
significant and many are beyond the 
Group’s ability to influence directly. 

The Board recognises the pace of 
change required within the Group to 
further adapt, build appropriate 
resilience and respond to this 
environment, in addition to the rapidly 
changing competitive landscape and 
wider global macroeconomic conditions.

The Group has reviewed the modelling 
of the impact of mitigating actions to 
offset further deterioration in demand 
and capacity, including reductions in 
operating expenditure and capital 
expenditure. The Group expects to be 
able to continue to secure financing for 
future aircraft deliveries and in addition 
has further potential mitigating actions 
it would pursue in the event of adverse 
liquidity experience.

Further details on debt financing can be 
found in the going concern disclosures 
in note 2 of the Group financial 
statements.

Based on this assessment, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in 
operation, meet its liabilities as they fall 
due and raise financing as required over 
the period to December 2026. However, 
this is subject to a number of significant 
factors that are outside the control 
of the Group. In reaching this 
assessment the directors have made 
assumptions when considering both the 
plan and the Downside case (the most 
severe and plausible of the viability 
scenarios considered):

•  the Group will continue to have access 
to funding options and that the capital 
markets retain a level of stability 
and appetite for funding within the 
aviation sector; 

•  the Group can implement any further 

structural changes required in 
agreement with any union 
consultation processes and regulatory 
approvals;

•  any future pandemic or other public 
health-related restrictions do not 
result in further prolonged and 
substantial capacity reductions and 
groundings as governments do not 
have the appetite for the economic 
impact and stress that it would place 
on their respective economies and 
populations; 

•  any new virus strain or threat to public 

health that emerges during the 
viability period can be managed within 
existing health and testing regimes 
without recourse to government 
regulations that significantly affect 
our airlines’ operations; and

•  geopolitical events do not result 

in significant war zones impacting 
financial markets, airspace operations 
and connectivity flows across our 
flight schedules.

Chairman's Introduction to Corporate Governance

Javier Ferrán
Chairman

Driving a culture 
that ensures 
alignment of our 
purpose, values 
and strategy

I am pleased to present 
the Corporate Governance 
report which provides an 
overview of IAG’s 
governance framework 
and its application during 
the past year, as well as 
the work of the IAG Board 
of Directors during this 
period. 

We remain committed to delivering 
sustainable long-term value and positive 
outcomes for our people, customers, 
shareholders and society. As I stated in 
the introduction to this annual report, 
2023 has been a year in which our 
recovery from the pandemic has allowed 
us to reinforce our purpose of 
connecting people, businesses and 
countries by restoring capacity, 
reopening routes and offering new 
destinations. 

136

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

It has been a year of hard work for our 
management team, moving from 
business recovery to the reset and 
transformation of the business into a 
new phase for IAG which we presented 
to the investment community at our 
Capital Markets Day in November 2023. 
With a long-term vision and a focus 
on the sustainability of our business, 
the Board has accompanied the 
management team on this journey, 
primarily supporting but also challenging 
them where necessary.

We are also proud of the progress made 
on sustainability. Our focus is supported 
by the work of the Safety, Environment 
and Corporate Responsibility 
Committee, which has been valuable in 
providing insight into stakeholders’ 
interests and oversight of the important 
sustainability and corporate 
responsibility work being carried out by 
our management team, ensuring that we 
are best placed to achieve our 
environmental and social ambitions.

The work of this and the other Board 
committees in 2023, as set out in their 
individual reports, is fundamental to 
supporting the Group governance 
framework that underpins our business 
model.

Board composition
There were no changes to the Board 
composition during the year. The Board, 
through the Nominations Committee, 
considers its composition and 
succession planning on an ongoing 
basis, including identifying those skills 
where enhancements to current 
composition should be a focus for future 
recruitment. We are confident that our 
Board brings together the range of 
experience and knowledge necessary for 
it to function properly, drawing on 
external advice or training in areas 
where specific knowledge is required or 
where we need to strengthen and 
supplement the board skills. Subject to 
our statutory nationality requirements, 
we have a fairly diverse Board, in the 
broadest sense, including five different 
nationalities and solid international 
experience.

Management changes
There were several key Management 
Committee appointments during the 
year. Following a period of renewal over 
the past three years, IAG’s new 
management team was introduced and 
took part in our Capital Markets Day. 
The refreshed leadership team is well 
positioned to support our Group Chief 
Executive in delivering our strategic 
priorities. These appointments are 
detailed in the Nominations Committee 
report.

Culture and diversity
Connecting with our workforce 
throughout the year has supported the 
Board’s ability to deliver on its key 
objective of driving a culture in IAG that 
ensures alignment of our purpose and 
values, as well as with the Group 
strategy. 

In 2023, we built on the comprehensive 
workforce engagement programme 
previously established and continued to 
meet and interact with our various 
teams. We recognise the time and 
commitment that this type of 
programme requires, both on our part 
and on the part of IAG and each 
operating company, but we believe that 
the value we derive from this 
engagement, both for the Board and for 
the management team itself, more than 
compensates for it. The open exchange 
and learnings provided by these sessions 
will serve to accelerate the cultural and 
operational transformation of the 
business. The workforce engagement 
section in this report provides further 
detail on programme content and 
positive outcomes delivered.

Creating a diverse and inclusive culture 
continues to be a focus. We are proud 
of our gender representation that 
includes 45% female Board members, 
a female Senior Independent Director 
and three female Board advisory 
committee chairs. We also have one 
director from a ethnic minority 
background. Our focus and resultant 
Board composition ensured that we met 
the targets for reporting set by the UK 
Listings Rules and complied with the 
Spanish Corporate Governance Code.

Succession planning and oversight of 
developments under our Equity, 
Diversity and Inclusion Policy will 
continue to be a priority. At 
management level, a great deal of focus 
and effort is being put into making 
progress in this area and the results are 
beginning to show, although there is still 
some way to go to achieve our ambition 
of 40% senior leadership roles held by 
women by 2025 and our newly reported 
ethnic diversity ambition of 10% for the 
Group’s UK senior leadership population 
by the end of 2027. Beyond these 
aspirations, the Nominations Committee 
has given priority in recent years to 
overseeing the detailed work on equity, 
diversity and inclusion, which is 
substantial, as well as the work 
completed on talent development and 
succession programmes. 

Board evaluation
Reflecting our commitment to good 
governance, the Nominations 
Committee oversaw the evaluation of 
the performance of the Board and all our 
committees, which we conducted 
internally under my leadership as 
Chairman of the Board, supported by 
the Board Secretariat. The outcomes 
and details of the process are provided 
later in this report. 

Our robust and efficient governance 
processes underpin our ability to live our 
values and deliver our strategy. The 
Board is committed to ensuring that we 
continue to maintain high standards of 
corporate governance and business 
conduct so that we can create long-term 
sustainable value for our shareholders, 
taking into account the interests of all 
our stakeholders.

Our people remain at the heart and 
centre of our business. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to express my 
ongoing appreciation for their efforts 
and commitment during this 
transformative year. I would also like to 
thank my Board colleagues for their 
continued support and dedication.

Corporate Governance

Statement of compliance 
with applicable corporate 
governance codes
IAG is incorporated and listed in Spain 
and is subject to Spanish legislation and 
corporate governance requirements. The 
Corporate Governance Report details its 
compliance with the Spanish Good 
Governance Code of Listed Companies, 
last updated and published by the 
Spanish Comisión Nacional del Mercado 
de Valores (CNMV) in June 2020, and 
available on its website (www.cnmv.es). 

IAG is also listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, and is subject to the UK 
Listing Rules, including the requirement 
to explain whether it complies with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 
published by the UK Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC). A copy of the current 
version of the UK Corporate Governance 

Code, updated and published in July 
2018, is available on the website of the 
FRC (www.frc.org.uk). 

IAG has prepared a consolidated 
Corporate Governance Report 
responding to both Spanish and UK 
reporting requirements, which is 
available on the Company’s website 
(www.iairgroup.com), as well as on the 
CNMV website (www.cnmv.es). Pursuant 
to the CNMV regulations, this report has 
been filed with the CNMV accompanied 
by a statistical annex covering some 
legally required data. This Corporate 
Governance Report is part of the IAG 
Management Report for the year 2023. 

In addition, and as required by the UK 
Listing Rules, this Report includes an 
explanation regarding the Company’s 
application of the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and how 

it has complied with its supporting 
provisions during the year. Details 
of where key information can be found 
are provided below.

During 2023, IAG fully complied with 
all applicable recommendations of the 
Spanish Corporate Governance Code; 
even though the Company 
acknowledges that, due to applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements of the 
aviation sector, the Company’s Bylaws 
contain certain share ownership 
restrictions which are contrary to the 
provisions of the first recommendation 
of the Spanish Code. 

The Company confirms that it applied 
the principles and complied with all 
the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in the reporting 
period.

Group structure
IAG, as the Group’s parent company, 
is responsible for defining the Group’s 
long-term strategy, as well as setting 
performance targets, monitoring their 
progress and allocating capital within 
the Group. IAG’s light central structure 
drives portfolio and financial strategy, 
oversees intragroup coordination to 
maximise value creation, manages 
central functions, including the 
development of its common integrated 
platform, and facilitates the sharing 
of best practice, innovation and 
synergies of scale.

Each operating company has an 
individual brand and cultural identity, 
and customised business model. Each is 
responsible for executing its strategy, 
accountable for its results and has its 
own board of directors and 
management committee, led by the top 
executive of each company. Matters are 
only executed centrally where it 
provides additional value and where 
centres of excellence have been created. 
While each of our airlines possess its 
own distinctive proposition, IAG enables 
them to work together towards a 
common goal.

Further details on the Group structure 
can be found in the Business Model 
section within the Strategic report. 

Board of Directors: division of 
responsibilities
The IAG Board is responsible for 
establishing the Company’s purpose, 
values and strategy, promoting its 
culture, overseeing the business and its 
performance, as well as for the Group’s 
long-term sustainable success. As stated 
in the Board Regulations, which are 
available on the Company’s corporate 
website (www.iairgroup.com), the Board 
endeavours to reconcile the corporate 
interest with the legitimate interests of 
the employees, suppliers, customers, 
and other affected stakeholders, also 
taking into consideration the impact of 
its activities on the community as a 
whole and on the environment. 
Examples of this long-term focus and 
consideration of stakeholders’ interest 
are discussed further in this report and 
in the stakeholder engagement section. 

Consistent with its governance role, 
the Board of Directors retains a schedule 
of matters reserved for its decision, 
as detailed in article 3.4 of the Board 
Regulations. 

The Board has four advisory committees 
that provide dedicated focus on a 
number of areas. Each Board committee 
comprises non-executive directors only 
and has an experienced independent 
non-executive chair. Copies of the 
minutes of all committees’ meetings as 
well as the documents distributed ahead 
of each committee meeting are made 
available to all Board members. 

The different Board positions and their 
respective responsibilities are detailed 
in the Board Regulations. The Board has 
also approved separate regulations for 
each of the Board committees. These 
regulations are also available on the 
corporate website. The roles, 
membership and activities of these 
committees during 2023 are described 
in the individual reports within this 
Corporate Governance report.

There is a clear separation of the roles 
of the Chairman and the Group Chief 
Executive, their main responsibilities 
are established in articles 5 and 6 of the 
Board Regulations. The Chairman is 
responsible for the operation of the 
Board and for its overall effectiveness in 
directing the Company. The Group Chief 
Executive and his management team are 
responsible for the day-to-day 
management and performance of the 
Group and for the implementation of the 
strategy approved by the Board.

All the powers of the Board have been 
permanently delegated to the Group 
Chief Executive save for those which 
cannot be delegated pursuant to 
applicable legislation, the Company 
Bylaws, or the Board Regulations.

The Board Secretary is Álvaro López-Jorrín, partner of the Spanish law firm J&A Garrigues, S.L.P. and the Deputy Secretary is Lucila 
Rodríguez. The Group Chief Financial Officer, Nicholas Cadbury, and the Group General Counsel, Sarah Clements, also attend Board 
meetings.

Directors’ independence
The Board, as reported by the 
Nominations Committee, reviewed 
directors' independence at its meeting 
held on 18 January 2024. It is satisfied 
that those directors classified as 
independent are free from any business 
or other relationship that could 
materially interfere with exercising an 
independent judgement, both as a 
question of character and judgement. 
Further details are provided on conflicts 
of interest and independence of 
directors later in this report and in the 
Nominations Committee report.

The Chairman was considered 
independent on appointment and 
neither he nor any of the non-executive 
directors has exceeded the maximum 
nine-year recommended term of service 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The longest serving director, 
Emilio Saracho, has served on the Board 
since 2016. 

Appointment, re-election, 
resignation, and removal of directors
The selection and appointment process 
is described in the Nominations 
Committee report.

IAG directors are appointed for a period 
of one year, as set out in the Company's 
Bylaws. At the end of their mandate, 
directors may be re-elected one or more 
times for periods of equal duration to 
that established in the Bylaws. In this 
way, the Company complies with the UK 
Code recommendation that directors 
should be subject to annual re-election.

Re-election proposals are subject to a 
formal process, based on a Nominations 
Committee proposal in the case of 
independent directors, or its 
recommendation for all other categories 
of directors. This proposal or 
recommendation is prepared having due 
regard to the performance, commitment, 
capacity, ability, and availability of the 
director to continue to contribute to the 
Board with the knowledge, skills and 
experience required. 

Directors cease to hold office when the 
term of office for which they were 
appointed expires.

Notwithstanding this, a director must 
resign under article 17.2 of the Board 
Regulations, when, amongst other 
matters, the director ceases to have the 
good standing, suitability, reliability, 
competence, availability or commitment 
to office necessary to be a director 
of the Company or when his or her 
remaining on the Board might affect the 
Company’s credibility or reputation or 
otherwise jeopardises its interests. 

According to article 24.2 of the Board 
Regulations, directors have several 
disclosure obligations, including the duty 
to inform the Company of any situation 
in which they are involved which may 
seriously affect the reputation of the 
Company, in particular if they are 
involved in any investigation in a criminal 
proceeding. In such circumstances, the 
Board would consider the case as soon 
as practicable and adopt the decisions 
it deems fit, following a report by the 
Nominations Committee and taking into 
account the corporate interest. 

144

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

The Board may only propose the removal 
of a non-executive director before the 
end of a term if, after receiving a report 
from the Nominations Committee, it 
considers there is just cause. For these 
purposes, just cause is deemed to exist 
when the director takes up new positions 
or enters into new obligations that 
prevent the director from dedicating the 
necessary time to the performance of 
their duties as a director, otherwise 
breaches their duties as a director or 
unexpectedly becomes subject to any of 
the circumstances set out in article 17.2 of 
the Board Regulations. 

The removal may also be proposed as a 
result of a takeover bid, merger or other 
similar corporate transactions that 
results in a material change of control. 

The rules on the actions and 
communication required from a director 
who stands down before the end of the 
term in office, are set out in the Board 
Regulations.

Diversity
The Board has a balance of members with 
more than 40% being women, with a 
woman as the Senior Independent 
Director and women chairing Board 
advisory committees. At least one 

member of the Board is from an ethnic 
minority background. 

The Board supports diversity in a 
broader context, considering several 
factors to optimise board composition. 
In addition to skills, gender and 
experience, the Board ensures 
compliance with regulatory 
requirements including the need to have 
more than half the Board comprised 
of independent EU nationals. 

Further details on the Equity, Diversity 
and Inclusion Policy, can be found in the 
Nominations Committee report.

Financial StatementsCorporate GovernanceStrategic ReportInvestment in the workforce
Group companies invest in their 
employees through training and 
development programmes, as well 
as through healthcare and wellbeing 
programmes. Specific conditions are 
set and managed within each operating 
company, enabling them to put in place 
appropriate programmes to reflect 
their specific operating model and local 
market conditions. 

Across the Group we look to ensure that 
all rewards and benefits are simple, 
clear, competitive, and fair. Collective 
bargaining arrangements are in place for 
87% of the workforce. We work closely 
with employee representatives to 
consult on reward matters. For those 
outside collective agreements, we 
benchmark roles and rewards against 
local markets to ensure they remain 
attractive and competitive.

Further information on workforce 
remuneration can be found in the 
Directors Remuneration Report. 

Corporate Governance continued

Board leadership and 
company purpose

IAG’s purpose – ‘To connect people, 
businesses and countries’ – underpins 
the Group’s vision to be a world-leading 
airline group on sustainability, 
maximising sustainable value creation 
for its shareholders. IAG continues to 
use its unique business model to pursue 
this purpose and vision, whilst delivering 
sustainable value for customers, 
its people, its shareholders and the 
communities it serves.

By connecting people, businesses and 
countries, the Group can provide the 
jobs, prosperity and cultural benefits 
that travel has always created. 

The Board believes that IAG can achieve 
its purpose and vision by promoting the 
Group’s common values of commitment, 
pragmatism, execution, ambition, 
resilience, and being a challenger and 
innovator, a team player, responsible 
and people-focused. The focus on 
corporate culture and values is an 
essential element in the continued 
transformation and execution of the 
Group's strategy.

Further detail on IAG’s purpose and 
values can be found throughout this 
annual report, including in the People 
section.

Corporate culture
As a Board, we have continued to focus 
on culture and ways of working within 
the Group as we invest in both our 
people and the business. 

Complementing the Group’s common 
values, each operating company and 
platform business has its own corporate 
culture and values which support its 
unique brand, business, customer, and 
employee propositions. All our operating 
companies and platform businesses 
remain focused on building and 
embedding the culture needed to enable 
our businesses to be competitive, 
achieve our transformation agenda and 
provide a great working environment in 
which all colleagues can thrive.

In 2023, the Board continued to review 
progress on culture, supporting 
management’s focus on transforming 
IAG’s culture and continuing to focus on 
building an inclusive, supportive, and 
healthy working environment. During 
2023, the Board considered the 
outcome of the latest Organisational 
Health Index (OHI) survey completed by 
all employees in May and the follow-up 
pulse survey undertaken in November, 
including the insights from operating 
companies and the agreed priorities for 
improving culture, ways of working and 
shaping people strategies. 

Further, through the enhanced 
workforce engagement activity 
highlighted in this report, 
representatives of the Board have heard 
first hand from employees across the 
Group on their experience of working 
within IAG, the prevailing culture and 
areas where improvements to current 
practices have been suggested.

At the Board strategy meeting held in 
September 2023, specific focus was 
placed on people and culture. Individual 
operating company plans were also 
reviewed to understand the extent to 
which their people transformation 
priorities and plans supported the 
delivery of the operating company 
strategy. 

The Nominations, the Remuneration and 
the Safety Environment and Corporate 
Responsibility Committees received 
updates on a range of workforce and 
people topics including talent and 
succession planning, inclusion and 
diversity, and workforce remuneration.

Decision making and 
stakeholder interests

Section 172 Statement 
(and compliance with article 
3.6 of IAG’s Board of Directors’ 
Regulations)

Section 172 of the UK Companies Act 
2006 requires directors of a company to 
promote the long-term success of the 
company for the benefit of its members 
and to consider the interests of other 
stakeholders in their decision making. 
This is in line with Recommendation 12 
of the Spanish Corporate Governance 
Code, which is reflected in article 3.6 of 
our Board of Directors' Regulations.

Given the nature of our business, 
we understand the importance of 
stakeholder engagement to inform 
our strategy and the way in which 
we operate. This section describes how 
the directors in their deliberations and 
decision-making, consider the interests 
of stakeholders to create value and 
promote the long-term success of the 
Company. As these interests can 
conflict, the directors need to balance 
stakeholder interests with the corporate 
interest, including consideration of the 
impact of activities on the environment 
and communities in which we operate. 
During the reporting period, the 
directors acted in good faith, with unity 
of purpose and independent judgement, 
upholding high standards of business 
conduct and treating shareholders fairly. 

Feedback from stakeholders received by 
various parts of the business helps to 
inform decisions overseen by the Board. 
Where relevant, the views of 
stakeholders are embedded in the 
proposals presented to the Board for 
consideration or decision. In addition, 
the diverse set of skills, knowledge and 
experience of the Board members 
enables them to apply the appropriate 
level of rigorous challenge and 
evaluation to decisions. 

Further details on how the provisions of 
Section 172 were considered can also be 
found throughout the Strategic and 
Corporate Governance reports. The 
Board of Directors’ Regulations as well 
as the Group policy on delegation and 
decision making ensures that relevant 
matters are escalated to the Board for 
consideration and that information is 
provided to directors with sufficient time 
for their analysis and consideration. 
Directors also participate in the design 
of the Board plan of activities for the 
year, setting the priorities for the Board 
and including any areas of interest 
requested by directors. Further 
information is provided in the 
Information and training section in this 
report.

Examples of relevant decisions taken during the year
In each instance, the Board was provided with a detailed analysis of the proposal, including potential alternatives, feasibility and risk 
assessment, as well as synergies across the Group.

Acquisition of aircraft
The Board approved several proposals 
to purchase aircraft including 10 A320 
neos, with no designated airline 
beneficiary, six Boeing 787-10s for 
British Airways and one Airbus 
A350-900 for Iberia
Section 172(1) provisions

(a), (c), (d)

Considerations 

•  Alignment to each airline’s strategic 

objectives

•  Securing commercially attractive and 

competitively priced terms 

•  Alignment with IAG’s environmental 

commitments, including zero 
emissions by 2050

•  Replacing older generation aircraft 
with more fuel-efficient aircraft 
generates significant fuel and 
maintenance costs savings, and 
improved reliability 

•  Improved utilisation of on-board 

space provides increased revenues 
and decreased costs and emissions 
per seat 

•  Improved customer experience both 

in airline and service levels, and 
responding to environmental 
concerns expressed by customers 

•  Sources of financing to meet the 

substantial payment obligations, with 
a potential consequential impact on 
existing debt providers. Related 
capital expenditure will mostly align 
to delivery of aircraft

•  For Iberia, the A350-900 is an 

efficient aircraft in terms of cabin 
layout and fuel consumption, and the 
backbone of Iberia’s transformation 
through fleet renewal to meet its 
medium-term objectives 

•  For British Airways, the B787-10 

provides improved efficiency and 
carbon intensity. Overall emissions 
are impacted by the high premium 
seat configuration, with decisions 
based on customer market segment 
drivers at the time 

Lounge investments
The Board approved a move of the 
Aer Lingus lounge terminal at John F. 
Kennedy International Airport (JFK) 
and an investment in British Airways’ 
lounge facilities at Miami International 
Airport
Section 172(1) provisions

(a), (b), (c), (d), (e)

Considerations 
Aer Lingus lounge move at JFK 

•  JFK is the flagship North American 
route for Aer Lingus, with ambition 
for further growth 

•  Supports long-term stability and 

future growth for Aer Lingus in JFK 
with potential for other Group airlines

•  Attractive alternative from a cost/

revenue perspective 

•  Provides ability to maintain current 

customer proposition 
accommodating current schedule 
and enables growth of future 
additional services

•  Facilitates excellent customer 
experience through continued 
provision of a dedicated lounge

•  Incorporates sustainability goals and 
requirements into the design and 
future operational planning 

British Airways Lounge in Miami

•  Alignment with British Airways’ 

strategy to operate a lounge in its 
most important locations 

•  Improves customer experience as 

current offering was an inconvenient 
distance to British Airways’ gates, 
and the new lounge will be within 
one minute walking distance 

•  Enables British Airways to control 
and enhance the entire customer 
proposition

•  Increases customer satisfaction and 

strengthens market position 

•  Benefit to other Group operating 
companies from lounge access 
•  Lease, construction and operating 
costs in line with overall Group 
strategy and business plan

Acquisition of Air Europa
The Board approved the acquisition of 
the remaining 80% of Air Europa, and 
the agreement was signed on 
23 February 2023. Completion is 
subject to regulatory approval

Section 172(1) provisions

(a), (b) (c), (d), (e)

Considerations 

•  The addition of Air Europa aligns to 
the Group’s strategic objectives. It is 
a good strategic fit and we have a 
strong record of successful 
acquisitions

•  Transforms IAG’s Madrid hub into a 
true rival to Europe’s four largest 
hubs, benefiting consumers and the 
wider Spanish market

•  Re-establishes IAG as a leader in the 
highly competitive Europe to Latin 
America and Caribbean markets 
providing increased access for 
customers, unleashing further 
network growth 

•  Significant customer benefits through 

increased choice and schedule 
flexibility and greater opportunities 
to earn and redeem miles

•  Financial impact of transaction on 

current and future objectives, 
including deferral of the purchase 
price until approval together with 
staggered payment terms

•  Significant synergy potential across 
the Group including the addition of 
reciprocal intra-Group codeshares 
across all connecting gateways

•  Remedy package still under 

discussion to address regulatory 
concerns

Financial StatementsCorporate GovernanceStrategic ReportCorporate Governance continued

Decision-making, reserved matters 
and delegation
The IAG Board has delegated the 
day-to-day management of the 
Company to the Group Chief Executive 
and the Group’s management team but 
it has reserved authority for itself on 
several matters, including three key 
areas as set out below: 

•  approval of the Group strategy and 

the supervision of its implementation, 
which entails the approval of the 
business plan, management objectives 
and annual financial plan, monitoring 
of the internal information and control 
systems, and of the risk management 
framework and processes;

•  approval and compliance oversight 

of the Group general policies 
including: the investment and 
financing policy; the enterprise risk 
management policy; the corporate 
responsibility or sustainability policy; 
and

•  according to certain quantitative 

thresholds, the approval of contractual 
commitments, asset acquisition or 
disposals, capital expenditures, 
borrowings, or equity investments.

The Group’s decision-making process is 
regulated by an internal policy covering 
the IAG Board, the IAG Management 
Committee as well as the boards of the 
main subsidiaries. In addition, another 
policy regulates the Group’s investment 
process. This authority framework and the 
support provided by the Board advisory 
committees underpin the effective 
operation of the governance system.

As indicated above, there are occasions 
where the Board may have to make 
decisions balancing the competing 
priorities of stakeholders. The principles set 
out in article 3.6 of our Board Regulations, 
which align with those reflected in section 
172 of the UK Companies Act, are 
embedded throughout the Group’s 
decision-making processes.

Stakeholders’ interests 
Day-to-day stewardship of stakeholder 
relationships is delegated to 
management, with the Board having a 
supervisory role based on the 
information provided and discussions 
held with management teams. In 
addition to this, the Board has direct 
engagement with the Company’s 
shareholders and with the workforce as 
recommended by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 

Information on the Board’s engagement 
with the workforce is provided in the 
workforce engagement section of this 
Corporate Governance report.

More information on our stakeholders 
and our engagement with them can be 
found in the Stakeholder engagement 
section of this annual report.

Shareholders and investors
Shareholder interests are key in the 
Board’s considerations. The Board 
maintains a direct and active dialogue 
with shareholders and investors mainly 
through the Group Chief Executive and 
the Group CFO, who meet with 
shareholders and investors on a regular 
basis, as well as through the Chairman, 
the SID or the committee chairs as 
appropriate. The Board is regularly 
apprised of shareholders’ feedback and 
the main issues discussed with 
shareholders and investors. 

In addition, the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee held meetings 
with investors as detailed in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Non-executive directors had the 
opportunity to meet shareholders at the 
shareholders’ meeting held in June, as 
well as during the Capital Markets Day 
held in November.

This was the first time since the 
pandemic that IAG had hosted a Capital 
Markets Day. Presentations and a 
recording from the day are available to 
view on our website. Discussions were 
led by the Group Chief Executive, 
highlighting our focus on maximising 
shareholder returns underpinned by the 
four near-term strategic priorities and 
capital discipline together with a strong 
balance sheet. The event provided an 
opportunity for our institutional 
shareholders to connect with 
management and to obtain a deeper 
understanding of how our stated 
priorities translate to the operating 
companies’ activities to achieve both 
transformation, innovation, and growth. 
Shareholders were able to hear from and 
ask questions of the Group Chief 
Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer, 
and other members of the IAG 
Management Committee, including the 
Chief Executives of the operating 
companies. 

Positive feedback was received that 
focused on the new strategic insights, in 
particular around the Group’s markets 
and networks, the increasing value of 
the Spanish businesses, as well as the 
attractiveness of IAG Loyalty. The 
information provided on financial targets 
was also well-received. On the other 
hand, analysts and investors noted that 
the higher level of investment would 
have a detrimental short-term impact on 
margins and free cash flow.

Additional information can be found 
in the Stakeholder engagement section 
of this annual report.

Workforce engagement
The designated directors visited our 
operating companies and platform 
businesses across IAG, to meet a variety 
of employees and leaders in their work 
context with the goal of better 
understanding first-hand the challenges 
and opportunities of the different 
businesses, employee issues and levels 
of engagement. These visits continue to 
be valuable in understanding what 
matters to colleagues across the 
business, from ground and flight 
operations to our customer support and 
corporate teams, and with a mix of new 
recruits and colleagues with long tenure 
reflecting the changing composition of 
the Group’s workforce. 

Eva Castillo is the director responsible 
for coordinating the workforce 
engagement. She has been supported 
during 2023 by Heather Ann McSharry, 
Maurice Lam, Emilio Saracho and 
Nicola Shaw. 

In 2023, the designated directors 
conducted eight engagement visits, 
meeting colleagues across all operating 
companies and across our four main 
hubs (London, Madrid, Dublin and 
Barcelona).

Board members noted the progress 
made on transformation across all areas 
and the increased focus on the people 
agenda and in improving organisational 
health and culture. The Board was 
impressed with the high levels of pride 
and commitment across all sites. 

Whilst each visit highlighted some 
specific local challenges, several key 
themes emerged. These included: 
communication, investment in facilities 
and IT, flexible work arrangements, and 
supply chain challenges. Each visit 
included a debrief with senior teams on 
emerging issues to ensure appropriate 
actions are taken forward. 

For further detail on the outcomes of 
broader employee engagement 
activities, refer to the Stakeholder 
engagement section of this report.

The Board considered the results from 
the 2023 workforce engagement 
programme at its December meeting. 
This feedback serves as valuable input 
for decision-making processes related to 
people and culture strategies and 
organisational transformation. 

In addition to the direct engagement 
with employees, the Board has been 
regularly informed about initiatives 
at each operating company with respect 
to its workforce. A session at the annual 
Board strategy meeting was devoted to 
the Group people strategy including 
updates on talent, culture and diversity 
and inclusion. 

The Remuneration Committee was 
updated on workforce remuneration and 
how the operating companies were 
supporting colleagues with cost-of-living 
challenges, ensuring reward remained 
fair and competitive, and how the 
experience of IAG’s workforce compared 
to senior leaders. The Nominations 
Committee was updated on succession 
planning for senior leadership including 
an overview of recruitment, mobility and 
attrition of senior leaders across the 
Group.

Board and committee meetings 
The Board met eight times during the 
year, including its annual two-day 
strategy meeting held in September 
2023. Details of attendance at Board 
and committee meetings are shown 
below.

The Board Secretariat together with the 
Group General Counsel maintains an 
annual agenda schedule for Board 
meetings that sets out strategic, 
standard, and operational matters to be 
considered. The Chairman sets a 
carefully structured agenda for each 
meeting in consultation with the Group 
Chief Executive, with support from the 
Group General Counsel and the Board 
Secretariat. During 2023, the Board’s 
main focus was to create sustainable 
value over the long term, supporting 
management and exercising oversight 
over the Group’s businesses and 
stakeholders’ interests. The key activities 
of the Board in 2023 are detailed in the 
Board activities table further on in this 
report. 

At each Board meeting, the Board 
receives a report from each of the Chairs 
of the committee meetings held prior to 
that Board meeting. The reports focus 
on the key discussions and decisions 
considered by the respective 
committees, providing an opportunity 

for directors to comment or ask 
questions on the matters dealt with by 
each committee and to ensure that all 
Board members remain apprised of 
committee activities. In addition, the 
Group Chief Executive and the Chief 
Financial Officer report to the Board 
on key matters in the Group.

All scheduled Board meetings include 
a private session for non-executive 
directors to meet with the Chairman 
to discuss any matters arising. At least 
once a year there is a private meeting 
with the Chairman that includes 
independent non-executive directors 
only. The Senior Independent Director 
also meets with the non-executive 
directors, without the Chairman, 
as part of the Chairman’s annual 
evaluation process.

As stated in the Board Regulations, 
directors shall make their best efforts 
to attend Board meetings. If this is 
not possible, they may grant a proxy 
to another non-executive director 
specifically for that meeting. No director 
may hold more than three proxies, 
except for the Chairman, although he 
cannot represent more than half of the 
Board members. As far as possible, 
proxies should be granted including 
voting instructions.

Board information and training
In general, all Board and committee 
meeting documents are available to all 
directors ahead of meetings, including 
the minutes of each meeting, through an 
online platform which facilitates an 
efficient and secure access to all 
materials. All directors have access to 
the advice of the Board Secretary and 
the Group General Counsel. Directors 
may take independent legal, accounting, 
technical, financial, commercial, or other 
expert advice at the Company’s expense 
when it is judged necessary in order to 
discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. No such independent advice 
was sought in the 2023 financial year. 

Directors are offered the possibility 
to update and refresh their knowledge 
of the business and any technical related 
matter on an ongoing basis to enable 
them to continue fulfilling their 
responsibilities effectively. Directors 
are consulted about their training and 
development needs and given the 
opportunity to discuss this as part of the 
Board annual performance evaluation.

During 2023, directors’ training needs 
were met by a combination of internal 
presentations and updates as part of 
Board and committee meetings and 
specific sessions or deep dives on topics, 
where required. Sessions which took 
place included an update on competition 
law provided by management to all 
Board members; a session on safety 
presented by an external expert to the 
Safety, Environment and Corporate 
Responsibility Committee; and a 
presentation to the Audit and 
Compliance Committee on corporate 
governance reform proposals by the 
external auditor, KPMG. A session was 
also provided to the Board by an 
external speaker on geopolitics and 
macroeconomic developments. Training 
for 2024 includes sustainability and 
technology topics such as artificial 
intelligence.

Induction of directors
According to the induction guidelines, 
approved by the Nominations Committee, 
on joining the Board every newly 
appointed director has a thorough and 
appropriate induction. Each programme 
is based on the individual director’s needs 
and includes meetings with other 
directors, senior management and key 
external advisers as appropriate. The 
induction is designed to provide a wide 
overview of the industry and the sector, 
including details of each of the markets 
in which the Group operates, as well as 
an understanding of the Group business 
model and its different businesses. 
The programme is also a useful tool 
to introduce new directors to the IAG 
Management Committee as well as to 
the different operating companies’ teams. 

In prior years, the programme was 
considered thorough in its coverage 
of the Group and the industry. 

No new directors were appointed during 
the year and therefore no induction 
programme was required.

Board and committee 
evaluation 
The effectiveness of the Board and its 
committees is reviewed annually, with 
an independent, externally facilitated 
review being conducted every three 
years. An internal evaluation was 
completed this year as an external 
review was undertaken in 2022. 

The evaluation was led by the Chairman, 
supported by the Board Secretariat, 
using a self-assessment questionnaire 
complemented by an individual 
interview conducted by the Chairman 
with each non-executive director. The 
results were presented in a report to all 
Board members, and an action plan to 
address matters raised was agreed.

The overall conclusions of the review 
were positive, confirming that the Board 
and the committees continued to 
adequately fulfil their responsibilities 
and operated effectively during the 
reporting period. 

In relation to the agreed actions for 
2023, the Board considered that good 
progress had been made during the 
year. Regular updates on shareholder 
and investor engagement would 
continue and be enhanced. Ensuring that 
the Board continues to have the relevant 
skills and expertise remains an ongoing 
area of attention for the Nominations 
Committee. The focus on customer 
experience would also continue.

In addition to reviewing progress against 
the agreed action plan for 2023, the 
Board evaluation highlighted the strong 
working relationship between the Board 
and management, the progress made on 
operating company transformation, as 
well as the enhanced focus on culture 
and people.

Actions agreed for 2024 include: 

•  broadening the Board’s visibility 

on engagement with stakeholders, 
with a focus on customers, suppliers 
and investors; 

•  prioritising the focus on management 

succession planning and talent 
development, as well as on the 
diversity and inclusion agenda; and
•  continuing to oversee the cultural 

transformation of the Group.

Other statutory information
Directors’ disclosure duties, conflicts 
of interest, and related party 
transactions
Directors must inform the Company of 
any participation or interest they may 
hold or acquire in any company that 
is a competitor of the Group, or any 
activities that could place them in 
conflict with the corporate interest.

According to article 21 of the Board 
Regulations, directors have an obligation 
to adopt the measures necessary to 
avoid conflict of interest situations. 
These include any situation where the 
interest of the director, either directly 
or through third parties, may conflict 
with the corporate interest or with their 
duties to the Company. In the event 
of conflict, the affected director must 
inform the Company and abstain from 
participating in the discussion of the 
transaction referred to by the conflict. 
For the purposes of calculating the 
quorum and voting majorities, the 
affected director would be excluded 
from the number of members 
in attendance. 

The 2023 Annual General Meeting held 
on 15 June 2023 approved the re-
election of Giles Agutter and Robin 
Phillips as non-executive proprietary 
directors as proposed by IAG’s 
significant shareholder Qatar Airways 
Group (Q.C.S.C.) (‘Qatar Airways’). Qatar 
Airways, a Middle East air carrier 
headquartered in Doha, has been the 
single largest shareholder of IAG since 
2016, owning, as of the date of this 
report, 25.143% of the share capital of 
the Company. Throughout this period 
there has been a long-standing business 
and commercial relationship between 
Qatar Airways and the Group airlines. 
This close relationship of commercial 
cooperation, which has always been 
undertaken on an arm’s length basis and 
on market terms, significantly reduces 
the potential existence of permanent 
conflicts of interest between Qatar 
Airways and the Group’s airlines. 

As far as the relationship of the 
proprietary directors with the significant 
shareholder who proposed their 
appointments is concerned, it should 
be noted that Giles Agutter is the owner 
and Chief Executive of the consultancy 
services firm Southern Sky Limited, 
one of whose material clients is Qatar 
Airways, and that Robin Phillips has no 
relevant connection with Qatar Airways.

Any potential conflict of interest that 
might affect such proprietary directors 
is managed by applying the duty of 
abstention in accordance with the 
procedure for managing conflicts of 
interest described below. In addition, the 
Spanish and the UK regimes on related 
parties’ transactions are also applicable 
as detailed below.

In accordance with article 3.4 of the 
Board Regulations, the Board of 
Directors has the exclusive authority 
to approve transactions with directors 
or shareholders that have a significant 
holding or that are represented on the 
Board or with any persons related to 
them, on the terms established in the 
law and the Board Regulations and this 
will require a prior report from the Audit 
and Compliance Committee.

The execution of these type of 
transactions needs to be reported to the 
Audit and Compliance Committee to 
ensure that they are carried out at arm’s 
length and with due observance of the 
principle of equal treatment of 
shareholders. IAG’s internal regulations 
on related party transactions establish 
that the Audit and Compliance 
Committee needs to issue a report 
to the Board assessing whether the 
transaction is fair and reasonable from 
the standpoint of the Company and, 
where applicable, of the shareholders 
other than the related party, and report 
on this assessment, including the 
assumptions and methods used. Where 
appropriate, the directors related to 
the transaction shall not participate 
in the preparation of such report.

Depending on the amount or value of 
the proposed related party transaction, 
different corporate governance and 
disclosure requirements may apply 
under both the Spanish and UK 
legal frameworks. 

In accordance with IAG procedures 
on related party transactions, prior to 
the Audit and Compliance Committee 
consideration, shareholder related party 
transactions are also reviewed by the 
IAG Management Committee and 
are reported to the IAG Head of 
Group Audit.

relevant authorisation); 

•  exclude pre-emptive rights in 

connection with the capital increases 
and the issuance of convertible or 
exchangeable securities that the 
Board may approve, under the

share capital to be issued on an 
unrestricted basis; and 

•  an additional 10% of the aggregate

convertible or exchangeable securities 
first being offered to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their 
holdings; 

•  carry out the acquisition of its own 

shares directly or indirectly through its 
subsidiaries, subject to the following 
conditions:

•  the maximum aggregate number of 
ordinary shares authorised to be

maximum amount permitted by the 
law and 10% of the aggregate 
nominal amount of the Company’s 
issued share capital on 15 June, 2023; 

•  the minimum price per share which 

may be paid is zero;

•  the maximum price per share which 

may be paid is the highest of: 

•  an amount equal to 5% above the 
average of the middle market 
quotations for the shares taken 
from the relevant stock exchange 
for the five business days 
immediately preceding the day of 
purchase; and 

•  the higher of the price of the last 

independent trade and the highest 
current independent bid on the 
trading venues where the 

transaction is carried out at the 
relevant time; exclusive of expenses. 
The shares acquired pursuant to this 
authorisation may be delivered 
directly to the employees or 
directors of the Company or its 
subsidiaries or as a result of the 
exercise of option rights held 
thereby. For further details see note 
31 to the Group financial statements. 
The IAG Securities Code of Conduct 
regulates the Company’s dealings in 
its treasury shares. This can be 
accessed on the Company’s website.

Capital structure and shareholder 
rights
As at 31 December 2023, the share 
capital of the Company amounted to 
497,147,601 euros (2022: 497,147,601 
euros), divided into 4,971,476,010 shares 
(2022: 4,971,476,010 shares) of the same 
class and series and with a nominal value 
of €0.10 each (2022: €0.10 each), fully 
subscribed and paid for.

As at 31 December 2023, the Company 
owned 55,844,755 shares as treasury 
shares.

Each share in the Company confers 
on its legitimate holder the status of 
shareholder and the rights recognised 
by applicable law and the Company’s 
Bylaws which can be accessed 
on the Company’s website.

The Company has a Sponsored Level 1 
American Depositary Receipt (ADR) 
facility that trades on the over-the-
counter market in the US. Each ADR 
is equivalent to two ordinary shares 
and each ADR holder is entitled to the 
financial rights attaching to such shares, 
although the ADR depositary, Deutsche 
Bank, is the registered holder. As at 
31 December 2023 the equivalent of 
40,547,684 shares were held in ADR 
form (2022: 48,799,780 shares).

Company’s share capital

Shareholders’ meeting 
The quorum required for the constitution 
of the shareholder’s meeting, the system 
of adopting corporate resolutions, 
the procedure for amending the Bylaws 
and the applicable rules for protecting 
shareholders’ rights when changing the 
Bylaws are governed by the provisions 
established in the Spanish 
Companies Law. 

The Annual General Meeting was held on 
15 June 2023 in Madrid. This was again 
held in person as in 2022, with the 
option for shareholders to attend and 
participate in the meeting remotely.

The Shareholders’ Meeting Regulations, 
which establish the operating rules 
of the shareholder meeting, are available 
in the Corporate Governance section 
of the Company’s website.

Disclosure obligations
The Company’s Bylaws establish a series 
of special obligations concerning 
disclosure of share ownership as well 
as certain limits on shareholdings, taking 
into account the ownership and control 
restrictions provided for in applicable 
legislation and bilateral air transport 
treaties signed by Spain and the UK.

In accordance with article 7.2 b) of the 
Bylaws, shareholders must notify the 
Company of any acquisition or disposal 
of shares or of any interest in the shares 
of the Company that directly or 
indirectly entails the acquisition or 
disposal of a stake of over 0.25% of the 
Company’s share capital, or of the 
voting rights corresponding thereto, 
expressly indicating the nationality 
of the transferor and/or the transferee 
obliged to notify, as well as the creation 
of any charges on shares (or interests 
in shares) or other encumbrances 
whatsoever, for the purposes of the 
exercise of the rights conferred by them.

In addition, pursuant to article 10 of the 
Bylaws, the Company may require any 
shareholder or any other person with a 
confirmed or apparent interest in shares 
of the Company to disclose to the 
Company in writing such information as 
the Company shall require relating to the 
beneficial ownership of or any interest in 
the shares in question, as lies within the 
knowledge of such shareholder or other 
person, including any information that 
the Company deems necessary or 
desirable in order to determine the 
nationality of the holders of said shares 
or other person with an interest in the 
Company’s shares or whether it is 
necessary to take steps in order to 
protect the operating rights of the 
Company or its subsidiaries.

In the event of a breach of these 
obligations by a shareholder or any 
other person with a confirmed or 
apparent interest in the Company’s 
shares, the Board may suspend the 
voting or other political rights of the 
relevant person. If the shares associated 
with the breach represent at least 0.25% 
of the Company’s share capital in 
nominal value, the Board may also direct 
that the transfer of any such shares is 
not registered.

Limitations on ownership of shares
In the event that the Board deems it 
necessary or appropriate to adopt 
measures to protect an operating right 
of the Company or of its subsidiaries, in 
light of the nationality of its shareholders 
or any persons with an interest in the 
Company’s shares, it may adopt any of 
the measures in article 11 of the Bylaws, 
including the determination of a 
maximum number of shares that may 
be held by non-qualifying shareholders 
provided that such maximum may not 
be lower than 40% of the Company’s 
share capital. If such a determination is 
made and notified to the stock market, 
no further acquisitions of shares by 
non-qualifying persons can be made.

In such circumstances, if non-qualifying 
persons acquire shares in breach of such 
restriction, the Board may also (i) agree 
on the suspension of voting and other 
political rights of the holder of the 
relevant shares, and (ii) request that the 
holders dispose of the corresponding 
shares so that no non-qualifying person 
may directly or indirectly own such 
shares or have an interest in the same. 
If such transfer is not performed on the 
terms provided for in the Bylaws, the 
Company may acquire the 
corresponding shares (for their 
subsequent redemption) pursuant to 
applicable legislation. This acquisition 
must be performed at the lower of the 
following prices: (a) the book value of 
the corresponding shares according to 
the latest published audited balance 
sheet of the Company; and (b) the 
middle market quotation for an ordinary 
share of the Company as derived from 
the London Stock Exchange’s Daily 
Official List for the business day on 
which they were acquired by the 
relevant non-qualifying person. 

Impact of change of control
The following significant agreements 
contain provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination 
in the event of a change of control 
of the Company:

•  Certain significant IAG financing 

arrangements allow for prepayment, 
redemption or early termination in 
certain circumstances if there is a 
change of control of the Company.

In addition, the Company’s share plans 
contain provisions as a result of which 
options and awards may vest and

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Nominations 
Committee Report for the year ended 
31 December 2023. This report provides 
an overview of the work of the 
Committee and its activities during the 
year. 

The contribution of this Committee is 
key to ensuring that we have in place 
both a Board with the right combination 
of relevant skills and capabilities as well 
as an executive team capable of 
delivering our strategy. As in previous 
years, in 2023 the Committee focused 
on succession planning and oversight of 
the work being done on diversity and 
inclusion for both the Board and senior 
leaders. 

Board succession planning remains an 
area of work to ensure collective board 
ability to oversee the implementation of 
the Group’s strategy and effectively 
support management to drive 

transformation. Building on the findings 
of the external Board evaluation 
conducted in 2022, which are in line with 
this year’s internal exercise, we have a 
clear understanding of the skills and 
expertise required and the aspects that 
we could strengthen, so that we 
continue to ensure the necessary 
expertise and experience on our Board 
and its committees. 

Executive succession planning and 
talent development has been an 
important area of focus. The ongoing 
monitoring of management’s plans and 
programmes to improve the bench-
strength and diversity of the Group’s 
senior leadership through active 
succession planning and talent 
management is a priority for the 
Committee. We also continue to review 
succession planning for the leadership 
teams at our operating companies. This 
year the Committee considered several 

new appointments to the IAG 
Management Committee and to the 
boards and leadership teams of some of 
our operating companies, including the 
appointment of Fernando Candela as 
Chairman and CEO of Iberia; Julio 
Rodriguez as Chief Commercial Strategy 
Officer; Jorge Saco as Chief Information, 
Procurement, Services and Innovation 
Officer; and Jonathan Sullivan as Chief 
Transformation and Corporate 
Development Officer.

Following the refresh of both our Board 
Directors Selection and Diversity Policy 
and our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion 
Policy in 2022, we continue to build on 
the diversity strategy and framework. 

We are satisfied that the Board 
composition continues to meet the 
targets for the proportion of women on 
boards and ethnic diversity as set out in 
either the European and Spanish 
standards and the UK Listings Rules, the 
latter informed by the UK FTSE Women 
Leaders Review and the UK Parker 
Review.

The Committee also supports 
management's efforts to strengthen the 
presence of women in the senior 
leadership of the Company and across 
the Group. Despite progress made in 
2023, we still have a way to go to reach 
our target of 40% of senior leadership 
roles being held by women by 2025. IAG 
leadership is committed to this ambition 
and more generally to promoting an 
environment that ensures inclusion and 
equal opportunities. The clear gender 
targets are being supplemented with 
broader diversity ambitions, including 
ethnicity. Current initiatives underway 
are both supported and closely 
monitored by the Committee.

In line with the expectations of the UK 
and Spanish Corporate Governance 
Codes, we undertook an internal Board 
and Committee effectiveness review. 
More information on the results of this 
evaluation, and how it was carried out, 
can be found elsewhere in this report. 
The evaluation was very positive, and it 
remains the case that we are satisfied 
that the Board and its Committees are 
effective and provide the highest 
standards of leadership and oversight of 
the Group’s strategy. The Nominations 
Committee will continue to provide a 
special focus to management succession 
planning and talent development, as well 
as to the work on diversity and inclusion.

The Nominations Committee
The composition, competencies and 
operating rules of the Nominations 
Committee are regulated by article 31 
of the Board Regulations and by the 
Nominations Committee Regulations as 
approved by the Board on 25 February 
2021. A copy of the Board and the 
Nominations Committee Regulations 
can be found on the Company’s website. 

The Nominations Committee has overall 
responsibility for leading the process for 
appointments to the Board and to 
ensure that these appointments bring 
the necessary skills, experience, and 
competencies to the Board, aligning 
its composition to the business strategy 
and needs. The Committee also reports 
to the Board on the proposed 
appointment of senior executives of the 
Company and IAG appointments to 
Group company boards. It oversees 
Board and senior management 
succession planning and in general the 
development of a diverse pipeline for 
succession.

The Nominations Committee shall 
be made up of no less than three 
non-executive directors appointed by 
the Board, with the dedication, capacity, 
and experience necessary to carry out 
its function. A majority of the members 
must be independent directors that 
are EU nationals.

There were no changes to the 
Committee’s membership during 2023.

The Committee’s responsibilities 
The Nominations Committee’s 
responsibilities can be summarised as:

•  evaluating the mix of competencies, 

knowledge, and experience necessary 
in the Board‘s membership and 
reviewing the criteria for the Board 
composition and the selection 
of candidates

•  submitting the recommendation 

for appointment of directors to the 
Board for approval, and reporting 
on the proposed designations of the 
members of the Board committees 
and their chairs

•  succession planning for Board 

members making proposals to the 
Board so that such succession occurs 
in a planned and orderly manner

•  reporting to the Board on the 

appointment and removal of senior 
executives (which includes all of the 
IAG Management Committee)

•  ensuring that non-executive directors 

receive appropriate induction 
programmes

•  setting diversity targets (gender, 
ethnicity, and other criteria) both 
within the senior management and 
the succession pipeline

•  ensuring that plans are in place 
for orderly succession of senior 
management positions whilst 
safeguarding the achievement 
of agreed diversity targets

•  establishing a target for female and 

ethnicity representation on the Board 
which should adhere to the 
Company’s Directors Selection 
and Diversity Policy

•  coordinating the annual evaluation 
of the performance of the Board 
and its committees

The Committee’s activities in 2023
The Committee met six times during 
2023, with three scheduled and three 
ad-hoc meetings called to discuss 
management changes or appointments 
to the Group company boards. Directors’ 
attendance at these meetings can 
be found in the Corporate Governance 
section. The Group Chief Executive 
was invited to attend the Committee’s 
meetings as and when necessary. 

The Committee focused on the following 
activities during the year:

•  review of the composition of the Board
•  review of the Board committees’ 

membership

•  Board succession planning
•  review of the directors’ independence
•  review of compliance with the Directors 

Selection and Diversity Policy
•  review of diversity and inclusion
•  management succession plans
•  format of the annual Board evaluation 

process, as well as that of the 
Nominations Committee

•  changes to Group company boards
•  review of investor feedback from 

the Annual General Meeting

Board succession
The Committee regularly reviews the 
formal succession plan for the Board, 
including analysis of non-executive 
directors’ length of tenure, skills and 
experience, and planning for succession 
relating to any areas that could require 
strengthening from a skills and 
succession perspective. 

In September 2023, the Committee 
considered Board succession planning, 
including the Board refreshment 
timeline, the Board skills matrix, as well 
as the consideration and identification 
of those skills and characteristics 
relevant for future appointments 
to align with strategic objectives and 
policies. The Committee also noted that 
in terms of Spanish company law, the 
chairmanship of the Audit and 
Compliance Committee would need to 
be refreshed during 2024, and discussed 
planning for this succession.

Financial StatementsCorporate GovernanceStrategic ReportReport of the Nominations Committee continued

Gender diversity principles are followed 
throughout the director appointment 
process, while preserving the general 
diversity and merit-based appointment 
principles established in the Policy. The 
Board’s policy is to consider candidates 
from a wide variety of backgrounds, 
without discrimination based on gender, 
race, colour, age, social class, beliefs, 
religion, sexual orientation, disability, 
or other factors. When conducting 
a search, the Company will only engage 
search firms that have signed up to the 
latest UK Voluntary Code of Conduct 
for Executive Search Firms (or its 
international equivalent). Additionally, 
the Nominations Committee ensures 
that the Board appointment ‘long’ and 
‘short’ lists provided in the search 
process are inclusive according to the 
widest definition of diversity.

Female directors currently represent 
45% of the Board, ahead of the target of 
at least 40%, and 63% of the 
independent non-executive directors 
(including the Chairman). In addition to 
this, three of the four Board advisory 
committees are chaired by women: the 
Audit and Compliance, the 
Remuneration and the Safety, 
Environment and Corporate 
Responsibility Committees. Lastly, the 
Senior Independent Director is a woman. 
From an ethnic minority perspective, the 
IAG Board has met its target to have one 
director from an ethnic minority group.

Directors’ independence, 
performance and re-election
The Nominations Committee, having 
considered the matter carefully, 
is of the opinion that all the current 
non-executive directors, with the 
exception of the two proprietary 
directors, are independent, both in 
line with the definition set out by the 
Spanish Companies Act and with that 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
and are free from any relationship 
or circumstances that could affect, 
or appear to affect, their independent 
judgement. 

In May 2023 the Nominations Committee 
considered the proposal for the re-
election of directors ahead of the Annual 
General Meeting. 

In accordance with the Board 
Regulations, all proposals for the 
appointment or re-election of directors 
presented to the 2023 Annual General 
Meeting were accompanied by an 
explanatory report issued by the Board 
of Directors with the support of the 
Nominations Committee assessing the 
competence, experience, and merits 
of each candidate. As part of its 
assessment, the Committee also reviews 
the time commitment and availability 
of each non-executive director.

Following this review, the Committee 
was of the opinion that each non-
executive director submitting 
themselves for re-election continued to 
demonstrate commitment to the role as 
a member of the Board and its 
committees and that each was making a 
valuable contribution to the leadership 
of the Company.

Each director is required to advise the 
Committee and seek its authorisation 
before accepting any external 
directorship or other significant 
appointment that might affect the time 
they are able to devote to the role as a 
director of the Company. 

Management appointments and 
succession planning
During 2023, the Committee considered 
and presented to the Board the 
following appointments to the IAG 
Management Committee: Fernando 
Candela as Chairman and CEO of Iberia; 
Julio Rodriguez as Chief Commercial 
Strategy Officer; Jorge Saco as Chief 
Information, Procurement, Services and 
Innovation Officer; and Jonathan Sullivan 
as Chief Transformation and Corporate 
Development Officer. 

Diversity
The procedure for the appointment 
of directors follows the principles 
established in the Directors Selection 
and Diversity Policy which has as its 
objective, the recognition of the 
importance of board diversity in a 
broader sense. As recommended by the 
Spanish Good Governance Code, the 
Nominations Committee reviews 
compliance with this Policy on an annual 
basis. The review for the 2023 reporting 
period was completed in January 2024. 
The diversity targets included in the 
Policy are to have:

•  at least 40% female board 

membership;

•  at least one of the Chair, Senior 

Independent Director, Chief Executive 
Officer or Chief Financial Officer roles 
be filled by a woman; and

•  at least one member of the Board 
being from an ethnic minority. 

When considering director 
appointments, the Committee follows 
a formal, rigorous, and transparent 
procedure, designed to capture the 
value of diversity in its broader sense, 
including a mix of skills, experience, 
professional and industry backgrounds, 
age, and ethnicity, while ensuring that 
any appointment is made on merit. 
Diversity considerations also include 
ensuring that more than half of the 
Board are independent EU nationals 
to meet regulatory obligations.

Diversity and inclusion remained a priority during 2023. IAG’s aim is for both senior leaders and our businesses to reflect the diverse 
communities we work in and to create an environment where individuals feel their unique differences are valued. Beyond gender and 
ethnicity, the Management Committee is comprised of individuals with multiple nationalities (including Spanish, British, American, 
dual Brazilian/Argentinian, Irish and Italian). In addition, most of the executives have multi-jurisdictional backgrounds and/or careers 
which serve to enhance the value that they bring to the Group, its customers and employees. Further information on Board diversity 
is included in the Corporate Governance section of this report. 

The Board and the Nominations Committee are committed to improving diversity, including gender diversity, across the Group, 
encouraging and supporting management actions in this regard. IAG has a target of 40% of senior leadership roles to be held by 
women by 2025. At the end of 2023, IAG had 36% of women in those roles, up from 34% at year end 2022, and on track to achieve 
the 2025 target. In line with the Group’s diversity and inclusion framework and strategy, the Group’s operating companies and 
platform businesses have implemented a range of initiatives to support equity, diversity, and inclusion. 

In 2023, IAG partnered with Green Park, an independent UK-based talent and diversity consultancy, to conduct a survey to better 
understand the composition and diversity of IAG’s senior leadership, going beyond gender to include a broad range of factors 
regarding identity. The survey was voluntary, anonymous and confidential, designed to take into account the legal and cultural 
contexts and regulatory requirements of our key countries of operation. The results are based only on those individuals who 
self-disclosed their data and will provide a baseline of the diversity of IAG’s senior leaders, enabling IAG to track progress over time. 
6% of IAG’s UK senior leaders self-disclosed as ethnically diverse and IAG’s senior leaders globally represent over twenty 
nationalities. To ensure the continued focus on increasing representation, IAG has introduced an ethnic diversity ambition of 10% for 
our UK senior leaders by the end of 2027. Results will be shared with our senior leaders to inform our people strategies and support 
discussions around equity, diversity and inclusion and responses feed into the UK Parker review. 

Further details and explanations of the steps that IAG is taking to promote diversity and inclusion across the Group is set out in the 
People section and the Equity, diversity and inclusion subsection of Sustainability in the Strategic report.

The Committee annual evaluation
The annual performance evaluation of the Board and its committees was internally facilitated in 2023, following an external 
evaluation in 2022, and as set out in the Corporate Governance Report.

The evaluation concluded that the Committee operated effectively during the year. The Committee continues to maintain as a 
priority its focus on board and management succession planning, including talent retention and development, as well as diversity 
and inclusion, as these are two complex matters where changes are generated over the medium and long term.

principal sustainability ratings followed 
by the Company. For the fourth year 
running, we are pleased to have been 
awarded a CDP leadership grade (A-). 
This is the longest leadership performance 
of any airline and recognises the 
continued commitment of IAG in 
addressing its climate change impacts. 

The Committee has been regularly 
updated on the numerous regulatory 
initiatives affecting sustainability. 
In particular, and with the support from 
the Audit and Compliance Committee, 
we also continue to put focus on 
improving our reporting, both internally 
and externally. We are pleased 
with progress being made towards 
a reasonable assurance report being 
provided for our statement of 
non-financial information before 2027. 

Regulatory developments and the 
impact on IAG were a key focus for 
the Committee again this year together 
with consideration of relevant industry 
developments. An external 
benchmarking report provided a good 
base to identify focus areas for future 
management attention, and was well 
received by the Committee. 

In addition to the core work on tracking 
progress against our overall 
sustainability strategy and objectives, 
the Committee had a specific update 
on sustainability matters focused on 
the Group’s suppliers, including modern 
slavery and human trafficking, as 
well as considerations regarding 
payment terms.

The Committee continued its work 
monitoring the safety performance of 
IAG’s airline companies. This included 
the systems and resources dedicated 
to safety activities across the Group. 
In line with the Group’s business model, 
responsibility for safety and security lies 
with each Group airline and is applied in 
accordance with the company’s 
applicable standards, culture and the 
circumstances and characteristics of 
each business. This Committee exercises 
a high-level oversight of safety activities 
to ensure a minimum Group standard, 
supporting the Group homogenisation 
effort in safety reporting, the discussion 
of common issues and the sharing of 
best practices between Group airlines.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Safety, 
Environment and Corporate 
Responsibility (‘SECR’) Committee 
report for the year ended 31 December 
2023. This report highlights some of our 
work and activities during the year. 

This Committee assists the Board in a 
dual role. Firstly, by providing high-level 
oversight of the Group's safety activities 
and resources, and promoting the 
sharing of knowledge and best practices 
within the Group. Secondly, the 
Committee provides guidance and 
direction on IAG’s sustainability 

programmes and corporate 
responsibility ambitions, ensuring 
alignment to the Group’s sustainability 
strategic priorities.

Based on the conclusions of the 
evaluation of the Committee's 
performance in 2022, we decided 
to restructure the Committee's work 
so that it is more focused, devoting 
two of its four ordinary meetings mainly 
to safety issues and the other two 
to environmental and corporate 
responsibility matters.

As we did last year, the Committee 
reviewed the information on the

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

The Safety, Environment, and 
Corporate Responsibility Committee
The Committee’s composition, 
competencies and operating rules are 
regulated by article 33 of the Board 
Regulations as well as by the 
Regulations of the SECR Committee. 
A copy of the Board and the SECR 
Committee Regulations can be found 
on the Company’s website.

The Committee shall be made up of 
no less than three directors appointed 
by the Board, with the necessary 
dedication, capacity and experience. 
All the members of the Committee are 
non-executive directors with the 
majority being independent directors.

In addition to the Secretary and Deputy 
Secretary, regular attendees at Committee 
meetings included the Chairman, the 
Group Chief Executive and the Chief 
People, Corporate Affairs and 
Sustainability Officer. Senior managers 
with responsibility for safety matters 
and others in charge of different 
sustainability areas were invited 
to attend specific agenda items as 
required and when relevant.

The Committee’s role 
and responsibilities
The Committee’s role is to support 
and advise the Board in matters relating 
to safety, environment and corporate 
responsibility. Responsibility for safety 
matters belongs to the Group’s airlines. 
IAG, through this Committee, has an 
overall view of each airline’s safety 
performance and of any important 
issues that may affect the industry. 
The Committee also has visibility 
of the Group airlines’ resources 
and procedures. Responsibility for 
performing detailed and technical 
assessments remains with each airline. 
In the areas of environment and 
corporate responsibility, the SECR 
Committee provides a governance 
forum for non-executive directors to 
exercise specific oversight, challenge 
and support to senior management 
in shaping the Group’s sustainability 
strategy, policies and targets, 
buttressing IAG’s vision to be a world’s 
leading airline group on sustainability.

According to its regulations, the SECR 
Committee’s remit includes: 

•  to receive significant safety 

information about IAG’s subsidiaries, 
franchise, codeshare or wet-lease 
providers used by any member 
of the Group

•  to exercise a high-level overview 
of safety activities and resources
•  to review the Group’s strategy and 

policies on social and environmental 
sustainability

•  to evaluate that the Company’s 

environment and social practices are 
in accordance with the established 
strategy and policies

At the July 2023 meeting, the Committee 
invited a representative of the Spanish 
agency "Servicios y Estudios para la 
Navegación Aérea y la Seguridad 
Aeronáutica" (SENASA) to provide the 
Committee with an overview of the 
aviation safety framework from a 
regulatory perspective. Also in the 
regulatory context, the Committee has 
decided to consider on an annual basis, 
in a specific way, the communications 
received from the various regulators 
on the safety performance of each 
of the Group's airlines.

This year, the Committee looked closely 
at the safety issues associated with the 
transport of lithium batteries and the 
approaches taken by the Group's various 
airlines. The Committee was also briefed 
on the operations of the Group in areas 
of conflict. 

Fundamental to our ambition is doing 
business in the right way. This is why 
sustainability is at the heart of our 
strategy as highlighted in November 
at the Capital Markets Day, with a 
dedicated presentation focusing on 
sustainability and the leading position 
that IAG is taking in the industry. 
Attendees were provided with an 
update on IAG’s progress and how 
we are using multiple decarbonisation 
solutions to achieve our net zero 
ambitions by 2050. The support 
of our other stakeholders, including 
policymakers, will be key for the industry.

The Committee’s performance was 
evaluated as part of an internal 
evaluation process. We used this 
opportunity to spend some time 
discussing the work programme and 
adapting it to ensure we continued 
to prioritise the right matters. We also 
agreed to continue to engage with 
external parties including those with 
expertise in the various components 
of our remit to enhance our work. 

I am delighted with the continued 
progress that has been made in the 
past year and look forward to furthering 
our ambitions in 2024.

Safety
Key topics discussed for each airline 
under their regular safety review include 
information on safety risk management, 
safety culture, operational risks, 
occupational injury risks, as well as 
reported data on aircraft damage. This 
year, the safety managers of each of the 
Group's airlines completed the revision 
of their reporting framework to this 
Committee, in order to homogenise and 
simplify the issues reported by the 
different airlines and to enhance 
comparability and sharing of best 
practices within the Group. In addition to 
this, the Committee considered some 
specific topics, including the Group 
airlines’ preparatory work for the 
transition to new rules regarding 
Continuing Airworthiness Management 
Organisation (CAMO).

A representative from the Spanish 
agency Servicios y Estudios para la 
Navegación Aérea y la Seguridad 
Aeronáutica (SENASA) joined the July 
Committee meeting to make a 
presentation on the aviation general 
safety framework. The Committee also 
devoted part of the same meeting to 
review practices and safety 
considerations for the transport of 
lithium batteries.

Market trends and EU and national 
ESG consultations 
The Committee has been regularly 
updated on any upcoming ESG policy 
consultations at international, EU or 
national level, including the Group’s 
positioning and actions intended in each 
of them. This year this included updates 
on the European Union ‘Fit for 55’ 
package, the UK Jet Zero Council, as 
well as the first meeting of the Spanish 
Alliance for Air Transport Sustainability.

Benchmarking 
At its meeting in May, the Committee 
considered a sustainability benchmarking 
exercise across all ESG factors conducted 
by an international sustainability and 
technology consultancy. The report 
provided an overview of IAG’s position in 
relation to the industry on a range of 
sustainability factors and provided a 
good roadmap for future management 
and Committee focus. 

Waste strategy, performance 
indicators and benchmarking 
The Committee considered an update 
on performance against its waste 
strategy plan adopted in 2021, with 
objectives due to be met by 2025. In 
addition to noting its current 
performance and endorsing the strategic 
objectives in this area, the Committee 
also considered industry developments, 
noting IAG’s performance was positive 
on a relative basis. 

•  to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
Company’s environment and social 
policies, to confirm that they are 
fulfilling its mission to promote the 
corporate interest and catering for, 
as appropriate, the legitimate interests 
of its stakeholders

•  to review the Group’s global 
environment and climate risk 
mitigation strategy, the 
implementation of sustainability 
programmes and any climate-related 
financial disclosure

•  to review the content of the Non-

•  to monitor and evaluate the 

Company’s interaction with its 
stakeholder groups, including the 
workforce

•  to review the principal environmental, 

social and reputational risks 
•  to review the general diversity 

and inclusion policies 

The Committee’s activities during 
the year

The Committee annual evaluation 
and priorities for 2024
The annual performance evaluation of 
the Committee was internally facilitated, 
following the external review completed 
in 2022. The evaluation concluded that 
the Committee operated effectively 
during the year. Notwithstanding this, 
the Committee agreed on several 
improvements for the coming year. In 
the area of safety, the Committee will 
analyse the safety corporate governance 
structures both in the different operating 
companies and in other airline groups 
with a view to improving coordination 
with the Group airlines and facilitating 
the exercise by this Committee of its 
general supervisory function. In the area 
of sustainability, the Committee will 
strengthen the focus on sustainable fuels 
and organise a knowledge update 
session in coordination with the Audit 
and Compliance Committee, as was 
done a few years ago. 

Stakeholder Engagement review
At its May meeting, the Committee 
considered a report on engagement 
with sustainability-specific stakeholders, 
industry associations, government 
and regulators, customers, investors, 
workforce and suppliers; going through 
the main objective of this dialogue and 
its impacts. More detail is included in the 
Stakeholder engagement section of the 
annual report. 

Modern slavery review
A session was devoted to updating the 
Committee on modern slavery and 
human trafficking matters within the 
Group, including supplier risks, training 
and information, compliance framework 
as well as the main external 
collaborations on this matter. More 
generally, the Committee was also 
updated on IAG GBS sustainability 
initiatives.

Sustainability risk
As in previous years, the Committee 
reviewed the Group sustainability risk 
assessments for the business plan period 
2024 to 2026 and to 2030, which helped 
the Committee understand the physical, 
policy, market and technology risks that 
the Group has considered could impact 
its sustainability ambitions. Further 
information regarding risks are set out in 
the Risk section of this annual report.

Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the report of the Audit and 
Compliance Committee for 2023. The 
Committee continues to play an 
important role in IAG’s governance 
framework, overseeing risk 
management, internal controls, financial 
and non-financial reporting, compliance, 
internal and external audit while also 
closely monitoring the macroeconomic 
and political environment and its impact 
on the business and its risks. This report 
provides an overview of the key matters 
considered in 2023, as well as insight 
into how the Committee has discharged 
its responsibilities and provided 
assurance on the integrity and reporting 
compliance of the 2023 Annual Report 
and Accounts.

The Committee held five planned 
meetings and two brief ad hoc meetings 
(to discuss specific matters such as 
auditor effectiveness) during 2023. The 

key items discussed by the Committee 
in discharging its oversight 
responsibilities and its areas of focus are 
set out in further detail in this report. 

The Group has focused during 2023 on 
reconnecting the world, transformation, 
returning the operations to pre-
COVID-19 capacity and improving 
resilience. As a result the Committee has 
increased its focus on the risk 
management, internal controls and 
financial implications of the strategy 
implementation. The rapidly evolving 
political and economic uncertainty 
arising from the wars in Ukraine and 
Middle East, along with continuing 
inflationary and recessionary pressures, 
has resulted in the need to constantly 
ensure these have been reflected 
by management in risk management, 
financial forecasts, strategic plan, going 
concern and viability assessments. In 
addition, digital security is fundamental 

to the Group’s operational resilience, and 
during 2023 management’s actions to 
improve digital and IT processes and 
systems have remained key areas of 
focus of the Committee.

Throughout 2023, I have maintained 
a dialogue with all members of the 
Committee, management and the 
internal auditors. I have met with 
‘agenda topic owners’ along with other 
Committee members prior to Committee 
meetings, ensuring the Committee 
would be provided with the necessary 
information to enable it to guide, 
challenge, advise and, when required, 
make informed decisions. I also met 
regularly with the lead partners of our 
external auditor, KPMG, and the Head of 
Group Audit.

The Committee ensures the reliability 
of the Group’s financial reporting, and 
compliance with laws and regulations, 
through the internal control framework, 
including the mature Group-wide 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
(ICFR) and risk management 
frameworks. During the year, 
the Committee closely monitored 
developments in and management’s 
response to the UK Government's 
proposed UK Corporate Governance 
Reform agenda, the FRC’s review 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and the passing of the UK Economic 
Crime and Corporate Transparency 
Act 2023. While the UK Government's 
proposed reforms and elements of the 
proposed Code changes are not being 
taken forward, the Committee noted 
that key learnings in management’s 
preparation for adoption have 
strengthened the Group’s governance 
and controls.

In 2023, the Committee obtained 
external independent assessments of the 
Group’s whistleblower/speaking up 
programme and ethics and compliance 
maturity, drawing management and the 
Committee’s attention to a number of 
improvement opportunities. 
Management is preparing a programme 
to address the priority findings 
highlighted. This will be a key area of 
focus for the Committee in 2024, 
including monitoring the execution of 
management’s programme supported 
by Internal Audit.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

I am confident that, throughout 2023, 
we have ensured: the key challenges and 
risks faced by the Group were reflected 
in the external and internal audit plans; 
effective controls remained in place; 
changes in the drivers of our principal 
and emerging risks were identified and 
effectively managed; ongoing 
compliance with all regulatory and legal 
obligations; and sound financial 
judgements and estimates continued to 
be made. 

I would like to express my sincere 
appreciation to all relevant Group and 
external and internal audit teams for 
their support of the Committee in 
delivering its remit.

The Spanish Code permits a Director to 
Chair the Audit and Compliance 
Committee for a maximum of four years. 
This report, relating to 2023, is therefore 
my last report before I step down as 
Chair of the Committee in September 
2024.

Audit and Compliance Committee Chair

The Audit and Compliance Committee

A private session of the Committee 
members was held at the end of each 
Committee meeting and during the 
year the Committee met privately on 
a number of occasions with each of 
the external and internal auditor and 
the Chief Financial Officer. 

The Committee’s responsibilities 
and activities
The Committee’s principal 
responsibilities are to oversee and 
provide assurance to the Board on 
the integrity and quality of financial 
reporting, effectiveness of audit 
arrangements and robustness and 
effective operation of internal controls, 
compliance and risk management 
processes and fraud prevention and 
detection. The Committee meeting 
agendas are tailored to ensure 
emerging topics are included and 
to allow for ad hoc discussion and 
reviews. A summary of the 
Committee’s activities during 2023 
and until the date of this report 
is detailed below.

The composition, competencies and 
operating remit of the Audit and 
Compliance Committee are regulated 
by article 29 of the Board Regulations 
as well as the Regulations of the Audit 
and Compliance Committee, both 
reviewed and approved in February 
2021. A copy of these Regulations can 
be found on IAG’s website. Following 
the recent publication of the updated 
UK Corporate Governance Code and 
related guidance, the Committee will 
review its regulations in the second 
half of 2024 and update them 
accordingly to reflect the updated 
Code and other relevant 
developments expected to be 
published in Spain.

The Committee’s composition, 
competencies and attendance
Detailed biographies of all Committee 
members are included in this Annual 
Report. The Board is satisfied that the 
Committee has retained competence 
relevant to its overall responsibilities, 
including possessing a wide range 
of financial, audit, risk management 
and relevant sector and business 
experience amongst its members, 
providing the right mix of skills and 
experience to provide constructive 
challenge and support to 
management. The Board has 
determined that Margaret Ewing and 
Maurice Lam have recent and relevant 
financial experience and the Board, 
through the Nominations Committee, 
will continue to review the 
Committee’s membership to ensure 
the skills and experience of its 
members align with the business 
as it develops.

In addition to the Secretary and 
Deputy Secretary, regular attendees 
at Committee meetings included the 
Chairman, the Head of Group Audit 
(who reports functionally to the Chair 
of the Committee) and representatives 
from the external auditor. Members of 
the Management Committee, including 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Group General 
Counsel and the Group Financial 
Controller were invited to attend 
specific agenda items as required and 
when relevant.

Significant financial reporting 
matters considered by the Audit and 
Compliance Committee
The Committee takes account of 
significant issues and risks, including 
strategic, business and operating, 
financial, compliance and regulatory, 
that may materially impact the integrity 
and accuracy of the quarterly financial 
results announcements or the 2023 
Annual Report and Accounts.

The Committee has also sought to 
ensure that the Group’s reporting is 
aligned with the latest guidance and 
requirements from regulators, that it 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
that all matters disclosed and reported 
upon meet the rapidly evolving needs 
of the Group’s stakeholders.

The significant accounting judgements, 
estimates, accounting policies and issues 
considered by the Committee in relation 
to the Annual Report and Accounts 

for the year to 31 December 2023 
(including those considered as 
significant audit issues by the external 
auditor and described in the 
Independent Auditor’s Report) are set 
out in the table below. After robust 
further consideration, challenge and 
debate, there are no topics where the 
conclusion resulted in significant 
disagreement between management, 
the external auditor and the Committee, 
or unresolved issues that needed 
to be referred to the Board.

Matter

Action taken by the Committee and outcome/future actions

VAT assessment 
on the issuance of 
Avios

The Committee received multiple updates throughout 2023 on the progress of HMRC’s substantive review into 
whether VAT should have been payable on the issuance of Avios contrary to a previous ruling issued in 1997 
and reconfirmed in 2011. Discussions with HMRC are ongoing and will continue in 2024.

Based on the facts presented, the Committee agrees with management’s assertion, confirmed by external 
Counsel and tax advisers, that it is possible, but not probable, that HMRC’s initial assessments will be upheld. 
As a result the Committee also agrees with management’s approach in the 2023 Group Financial statements in 
that the matter is disclosed as a contingent liability and no provision is recorded for this exposure.

The Committee also challenged management on the disclosure made in the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts 
and whether the disclosure enabled users to sufficiently understand the status of HMRC’s substantive review. 
Given the number of possible scenarios that could eventuate from the substantive review, the Committee 
concurred with management and the conclusions reached by the external auditor not to give a range of 
potential exposures as it could prejudice seriously the position of the Group.

Loyalty revenue 
recognition

The Committee focused on the impact of IAG Loyalty’s change in actuarial modelling provider, including 
a change in the external actuarial specialist, on the breakage and assumptions driving loyalty revenue 
recognition. The Committee was reassured that the migration reconfirmed the appropriateness of the loyalty 
scheme liabilities with no material adjustments as a result of the transition.

Voucher revenue 
recognition

Group accounting 
policy on major 
maintenance 
events for leased 
aircraft

The Committee is satisfied that the estimates relating to loyalty revenue recognition are appropriately 
supported by reasonable management assumptions and those of an independent expert third party. 
The Committee also considered the conclusions of the external auditor, who had identified loyalty revenue 
recognition as a key audit matter.

The Committee received quarterly updates throughout 2023 on management’s assumptions in relation 
to revenue recognition relating to vouchers issued in relation to conditions during and immediately after the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including issuances, redemptions, refunds and the amounts recognised as breakage. 
For the years to 31 December 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Group recognised no breakage on vouchers but given 
the recovery from COVID-19, coupled with the availability of sufficient historical redemption and expiry data, 
the Group has commenced recognising breakage on a limited population of the voucher liability during 2023. 
The Committee agrees with management’s assessment that breakage can now be reliably estimated and that 
there will not be a significant reversal of revenue in future periods as a result of having recorded breakage 
during 2023. The Committee also recognised that as vouchers began to contractually expire in 2023 and 
management has been taking action to encourage voucher holders to utilise their vouchers before they expire, 
the Group has more data upon which to estimate and recognise breakage on unredeemed vouchers 
during 2024.

During the course of 2023, management presented to the Committee a detailed analysis of the Company’s 
accounting policies, in response to the enquiries from the CNMV, with regard to major maintenance events on 
owned and leased aircraft, including peer benchmarking, industry guidance and analysis of alternative 
accounting policies. In particular, for leased aircraft, IFRS does not provide specific guidance on how to account 
for major maintenance events and whether to adopt a provisions approach, whereby provisions for such 
maintenance events are built up over time through the usage of the asset, or to apply the components 
approach, whereby each major maintenance event is capitalised and depreciated to the sooner of the next 
event or the end of the lease. The Committee concurred with the continued application of the existing 
accounting policy of applying the provisions approach.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Other significant matters considered 
Highlights of other key matters that the Committee considered are explained below.

Matter

Viability and going 
concern 
assessments

Action taken by the Committee and outcome/future actions
Throughout the year and in finalising the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts the Committee has continued 
to consider and robustly challenge management’s going concern review and viability assessment, including 
the supporting analysis. 

Fraud procedures

CNMV Letters 
and enquiries

The Committee was reassured by management’s assessment in 2023 and update of its three-year forecasts, as 
part of the financial plan through to 31 December 2026. The Committee’s reassurance was gained by a review 
of critical estimation assumptions and judgements applied in relation to cash flow forecasts over the short, 
medium and long term, including the implications of climate change where they impacted the reference period. 
Many of the assumptions and judgements are based on events outside the Group’s control including the 
political and economic influences such as the wars in the Ukraine and the Middle East, volatile fuel prices and 
high inflation and interest rates. 

The Viability statement section of this Annual Report provides details of the Base Case and Downside Case 
applied in assessing the appropriateness of the Board’s viability statement and assessment of the going 
concern basis of accounting. The Committee provided robust challenge of the assumptions applied in 
management’s Base case and Downside case projections (ensuring that the Downside case reflected 
appropriately severe but plausible assumptions) and reviewed the external auditor’s findings and conclusions 
on this matter. Alternative negative scenarios were also considered by the Committee but the Downside case 
presented the most severe but plausible scenario.

The Committee recommended the going concern statement and related disclosures to the Board for inclusion 
in the 2023 half-year interim results announcement and the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts and the viability 
statement for inclusion in the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.

The Committee reviewed management’s report on the Group’s fraud prevention framework, including the 
annual fraud risk assessment and the key controls and lines of defence in place to prevent and detect fraud. 
The Committee noted good alignment between the risk assessment and the assurance map, including lines 
of defence, and was satisfied that the approved internal audit plan covered the key financial reporting anti-
fraud controls as well as audits targeted at specific fraud risk across the Group during this period.

Following Royal Assent of the UK Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023, the Committee will 
closely monitor the implementation guidance, much of which will require further secondary legislation expected 
over the next 12-24 months. The Committee will also monitor management’s response to the guidance 
specifically concerning reasonable procedures in place to prevent fraud and any enhancements required to the 
Group’s fraud prevention framework.

On behalf of the Board, the Committee will continue to monitor fraud and internal controls carefully, including 
consideration of the enhanced audit review of fraud controls and views of the external auditor, the results 
of the annual ICFR audits and the results of a series of focused anti-fraud control internal audits.

In April 2023, the Company received a comment letter from the CNMV requesting that for each quarterly 
earnings release and associated results presentations, the Company include a definition of each Alternative 
Performance Measure (APM) and to ensure that such APMs are not given undue prominence to IFRS reported 
measures. No changes were proposed or sought in relation to the Annual Report and Accounts. The 
Committee reviewed and concurred with the enhancements to the quarterly earnings releases and associated 
results presentations, as a result of the comment letter and, having sought the views of the external auditor, 
with management’s responses to the letter, which was submitted in May 2023. The CNMV has accepted IAG’s 
response and enhancements.

In May 2023 the Company received a second comment letter from the CNMV, requesting certain information 
and clarifications relating to accounting matters and disclosures in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report and 
Accounts, none of which were considered material. The Committee reviewed and concurred the enhancements 
to the Annual Report and Accounts as a result of the comment letter and, having sought the views of the 
external auditor, with management’s responses to the letter, which were submitted in July 2023. The CNMV has 
accepted IAG’s response and proposed enhancements reflected in the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.

During the course of 2023, the Company has received a number of enquiries from the CNMV, requesting 
information and clarifications relating to the Company’s accounting policies for major maintenance events for 
both owned and leased aircraft. In forming its responses, management incorporated: (i) detailed analysis of its 
current accounting policies; (ii) benchmarking of peer accounting policies; (iii) consideration of industry 
guidance; and (iv) consideration of alternative accounting policies. The Committee reviewed and concurred 
with management’s responses to the aforementioned enquiries. As at 31 December 2023 and through to the 
date of this report, correspondence with the CNMV is ongoing and the Group continues to engage on this 
complex area of accounting.

Matter

Action taken by the Committee and outcome/future actions

Corporate 
governance and 
audit reform

Non-financial 
information and 
environment

Throughout 2023, the Committee closely monitored developments in and ongoing consultations in respect 
of the UK's Corporate Governance Reform agenda, the FRC’s review of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and the passing of the UK Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. In May, the Committee 
received a detailed briefing (from the external auditor) of the UK Government’s and FRC’s corporate 
governance and Code reform proposals and management presented its plans and proposed timelines to adopt 
the various governance initiatives as well as a view of those initiatives already in place under the Group’s 
Spanish governance framework. 

While the UK Government's proposed Corporate Governance Reform and elements of the proposed Code 
changes will not be taken forward, the Committee’s focus has remained on maintaining robust internal control 
and governance frameworks. Management’s key learnings in preparing for adoption are leading to control 
improvements, greater assurance transparency and strengthening the Group’s governance frameworks.

The Committee believes management is well placed to adopt the new provisions outlined in the revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code and, where appropriate, the associated guidance and awaits the implementation 
legislation to be made available in relation to the “failure to prevent fraud” expected in 2024. Throughout 2024, 
the Committee will be reviewing the status of these reforms and management’s and the Committee’s plans to 
ensure full compliance in accordance with the relevant regulatory and legal timetable. 

In conjunction with the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee, the Committee plays 
a key role in the governance of regulatory reporting requirements in respect of non-financial information, 
particularly those related to workforce data and climate-related risks and opportunities. This Committee 
is pleased with management’s significant progress in designing and documenting internal controls over 
non-financial reporting (ICNFR) across the Group to ensure there are robust processes and controls in place 
to obtain reliable data.

At the request of the Committee, additional non-financial information process and control internal audits were 
undertaken in 2023 to inform management’s drive to improve the ICNFR framework. The focus of ICNFR audits 
will continue in 2024 to provide the Committee with assurance that the newly implemented controls are 
operating effectively.

The Committee continued to receive regular updates in relation to the statements on non-financial information 
and diversity (prepared in compliance with the requirements of Law 11/2018) as well as management’s 
demonstration of close alignment with key sustainability frameworks, including TCFD. The Committee also 
considered the limited assurance reports from KPMG on the Group’s non-financial information, including TCFD 
compliance and EU taxonomy.

Risk appetite 
framework

In early 2023, the Board (supported by management) introduced a new risk appetite framework which set 
tolerances across the business plan period and enabled consideration of trade-offs to facilitate prioritisation 
of initiatives to manage opportunities and risk within the defined appetite tolerances. 

Compliance

The Committee received an update from management in December on the Group’s performance against the 
appetite tolerances set at the beginning of 2023. The Committee is satisfied that the new framework is aligned 
to the Group strategy reviewed and approved by the Board in September 2023 and that the Group continued 
to perform and deliver initiatives throughout 2023 as planned to mitigate risk as set out in its framework 
statements.

Appetite discussions following the Strategy Board meeting in September 2023 were held with each of the 
Board members in November to re-assess their appetite in light of the current risk environment, updated Group 
strategy and Group performance in 2023, to be applied during 2024 and discussed and agreed at the 
December Board meeting.

The Committee recognises the critical role of compliance in upholding the highest ethical standards across 
the Group. A Group Head of Compliance and Ethics was appointed in June 2023. The Committee requested an 
independent review be undertaken of both the Group’s whistleblowing provisions and culture as well as the 
maturity of the overall ethics and compliance capabilities. In addition to receiving the annual compliance update 
from management, in December Deloitte presented the conclusions of its independent assessment including 
the areas it believes are opportunities for improvement across the Group. Management is preparing its 
response and plans for addressing the recommendations and this will be a key area of focus for the Committee 
during 2024 and 2025.

The Committee will continue to receive regular updates on all the above matters in 2024.

•  holding regular meetings during the 
year between the Committee, the 
Head of Group Audit and the external 
audit partners as well as ensuring the 
Head of Group Audit feels able to 
raise any concerns informally and 
directly with the Chair of the 
Committee; 

•  monitoring and protecting internal 
audit’s independence and standing 
within the Group, ensuring its ability 
to influence and engage at the most 
senior levels across IAG and all 
operating companies and functions 
and is closely involved in the Group’s 
discussions on risk; and

•  performing an effectiveness review 
with key stakeholders in December 
2023.

The Committee is satisfied that delivery 
of the approved internal audit strategy 
and plan is providing timely and 
appropriate assurance on the 
effectiveness of controls in place to 
successfully and effectively manage 
aspects of the Group’s relevant principal 
risks (i.e. those that are capable of being 
subject to an audit review).

Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting
The Board of Directors is ultimately 
responsible for the supervision of the 
existence and effectiveness of Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR). 
The Board has delegated the 
responsibility for the development of 
effective controls to the Group Chief 
Executive Officer and the supervision of 
the effectiveness of these controls to the 
Audit and Compliance Committee. 

The Group’s ICFR monitoring and 
auditing is mature and well embedded 
across the Group, covering processes 
applied by the Company, Aer Lingus, 
British Airways, IAG GBS, IAG Loyalty, 
Iberia and Vueling, and processes 
performed by IAG GBS and IAG Cargo 
on behalf of the operating companies. 
This enables the Committee to evaluate 
and oversee IAG’s management of 
financial reporting risk and to validate 
the Group’s approach to complying with 
the CNMV’s ICFR recommendations.

In 2023, the Committee reviewed the 
results of the internal audits and external 
audit of ICFR (which included IT general 
controls). Despite the return to pre-
COVID-19 pandemic operating 
conditions in 2023, no unremediated 
material or significant weaknesses that 
would impact the integrity of the 
financial statements were identified, and 
management continued to improve the 
control environment across the Group. 
The Committee also tracked the 
progress of internal audit 
recommendations to address any 
weaknesses identified. 

Internal audit
The Committee’s activities during 2023 
in relation to the Internal Audit function 
included:

•  reviewing and agreeing the internal 
audit 2023 plan and 2024 first six 
months plan (including resourcing and 
budget to appoint appropriate 
external specialist resource and recruit 
additional permanent resource when 
required to ensure the function is 
appropriately resourced to provide 
the required level of assurance over 
the principal risks, processes and 
controls throughout the Group). This 
included ensuring the 2023 plan 
continued to focus on fraud risk while 
also ensuring coverage of specific 
risks, including cyber security, IT 
transformation programmes, non-
financial information and satisfying 
ICFR and Spanish Criminal Code 
requirements;

•  reviewing key audit conclusions, 

discussing the quality and timeliness 
of management’s responses, 
monitoring the resolution of issues 
raised and requesting additional audit 
review of certain weaknesses or 
concerns identified by internal audit, 
post management action to 
remediate. Where an internal audit 
finding was rated seriously deficient, 
relevant responsible management 
were requested to, in person, present 
their plans and progress in addressing 
the audit recommendations and 
required actions, reflecting the 
importance the Committee attributes 
to the internal audits and their 
conclusions;

The Committee engaged throughout the 
year with KPMG, with the engagement 
partners attending all Committee 
meetings. Following completion of the 
2022 audit, the UK lead audit partner 
retired and Paul Nichols was appointed 
as KPMG’s UK lead audit partner, 
following his shadowing and 
transitioning activities during 2022. 

The Committee Chair met frequently 
with the Group and lead audit partners 
throughout the year to review Group 
developments, audit progress, their 
planned reporting and audit findings. 
The Committee’s key activities in relation 
to its interaction with KPMG included:

•  review of KPMG’s third-year audit 

arrangements and plan, and 
overseeing progress throughout 2023;

•  approval of the 2023 external audit 

plan and strategy including 
consideration of scope, approach and 
methodology, emerging industry and 
Group-specific audit risks and 
materiality. Monitoring the audit plan’s 
implementation, including receiving 
regular reports from KPMG, progress 
against plan in consideration of key 
judgements, audit matters and any 
significant weaknesses detected in the 
internal control environment;

•  discussion, prior to recommendation 
of the financial statements to the 
Board for approval, of the audit 
findings, including audit differences, 
and observations on internal controls, 
operations and resources. This 
included challenging the auditors on 
their conclusions regarding voucher 
revenue recognition discussed in 
significant financial reporting matters. 

•  performing an assessment of the 

effectiveness and independence of 
KPMG, including the quality of the 
2023 audit (throughout the year), 
implementation of improvement 
opportunities identified in the 2022 
effectiveness assessment and 
reviewing and approving the fees and 
terms of reference; and

•  reviewing and approving 2023 

non-audit services expenditure against 
policy and previously determined limit 
guidance. Reviewing and approving 
non-audit services limit guidance and 
expectations for 2024.

External audit scope, materiality and 
execution 
The Committee discussed and agreed 
the scope of the audit with KPMG in May 
including the interim review plan 
(comprising audit testing, risk assurance 
procedures, process walkthroughs, 
control testing and data and analysis 
routines) and ensuring that the audit 
strategy was robust and informed by the 
auditor’s assessment of the Group’s key 
risks, particularly those that are 
significant to the audit. KPMG explained 
to the Committee the key tests that it 
intended performing on the identified 
higher-risk audit areas that could lead to 
material misstatement of the financial 
statements and significantly influenced 
the audit plan. The auditor and the 
Committee confirmed a shared 
understanding of these risks and key 
audit matters, including passenger 
revenue recognition, the carrying value 
of tangible and intangible assets and 
how these were to be considered in the 
audit approach. During the fourth 
quarter, KPMG confirmed that, as a 
result of the forecast Group trading 
results and the headroom on the annual 
impairment assessment, the risk of asset 
impairment was no longer considered to 
be a significant risk.

The auditor confirmed that 100% 
(2022: 99%) of the Group’s forecast 
revenue and 95% (2022: 95%) of the 
Group’s forecast total assets would be 
subject to a full scope audit. The 
Committee agreed, after challenging the 
external auditor as to whether such a 
high level of coverage was required, that 
the approach was appropriate and 
should provide the Board with a high 
level of assurance regarding the integrity 
of the financial statements and 
subsequently approved the audit plan, 
recognising that the plan would evolve 

as the year concluded to reflect any 
changes in circumstances or outlook.

The Committee agreed with KPMG, 
in considering the accuracy of financial 
reporting, the scale of accounting errors 
of lesser significance that were to be 
brought to the Committee’s attention 
and the amounts that would need to be 
adjusted so that the financial statements 
give a true and fair view. The Committee 
agreed with the planning materiality 
based on the forecast results for 2023, 
which the Committee and the auditor 
kept under review during the final 
quarter of 2023 and the final stages of 
the 2023 audit.

External auditor quality and 
effectiveness
The Committee is very focused on audit 
quality and effectiveness, which is 
reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure 
the rigour and challenge of the external 
audit process is maintained. The 
Committee received updates from 
KPMG at five Committee meetings, 
enabling the Committee to assess and 
measure the quality of the audit through 
regularly monitoring the auditor’s 
communications with management 
and the Committee, including discussion 
and challenge during Committee 
meetings, compliance with relevant 
regulatory, ethical and professional 
guidance and assess, on an ongoing 
basis, the audit team’s qualifications, 
expertise, resources, partner 
performance and the effectiveness of 
the audit process. The Committee’s 
assessment included, in addition to its 
own independent assessment, a survey 
as well as detailed discussion with key 
executives and finance staff, which 
demonstrated that the 2023 external 
audit was deemed to be effective, 
robust and of good quality. The 
Committee’s independent assessment 
considered the overall quality of the 
audit, including whether the auditor 
exhibited an appropriate level of 
challenge and scepticism in its work 
and dealings with management and the 
independence of KPMG.

172

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

The Committee also assessed the 
depth of review and level of challenge 
provided by the external auditor over 
the significant accounting policies, 
judgements and estimates made by 
management. The Committee felt that 
KPMG challenged management robustly 
on key judgements and estimates, 
accounting treatments and disclosures, 
for example in relation to loyalty 
programme revenue recognition where 
KPMG’s challenge included an evaluation 
of the effectiveness of management’s 
expert, the transition to a new expert 
and modelling. The observations and 
conclusion of the Committee in respect 
of this matter are noted in this 
report above. 

In addition to the annual evaluation 
and regular review of reports to the 
Committee and observations and 
feedback on the working practices of the 
KPMG audit team, the Committee 
undertook an ongoing assessment of 
external audit quality and effectiveness 
including, but not limited to, the following:

•  the Committee oversaw formal terms 
of engagement with the auditor and, 
after significant challenge by 
management as to the composition 
and quantum of the proposed fee 
increase, agreed the audit fee. KPMG 
assured the Committee that despite 
a significant increase compared 
with the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fee, 
the approved 2023 fee was at a level 
that was appropriate for the scope 
of the audit, to enable a quality audit 
to be undertaken;

•  reports from the external auditor 

were reviewed during all Committee 
meetings in 2023 and again in the 
February 2024 Committee meeting, 
covering: the conclusions of the 
review of the Group’s results for the 
half year; audit planning updates; 
interim audit findings (including those 
of the review of the relevant key IT 
general controls); progress update 
for year end matters; and final report 
for year end matters; 

•  KPMG attended all five of the planned 
Committee meetings during the year 
to answer any questions the 
Committee had outside these formal 
updates; and 

•  consideration of the FRC’s most 
recent Audit Quality Review 
conclusions relating to KPMG as a firm 
and any specific findings relating 
to audits led by the lead audit 
partners to IAG.

Taking all aspects of the assessment 
throughout the year into consideration, 
the Committee concluded that it is 
satisfied that the KPMG audit was 
probing, challenging and robust and the 
approach provided a reliable audit 
opinion with a reasonable expectation 
of detecting material errors, irregularities 
and material fraud. The Committee 
considered the external audit to have 
been effective and of a high quality.

External auditor non-audit services and independence 
Non-audit service spend in 2023 is within the total target maximum and was €1,807,000. The Committee concluded that KPMG 
is independent, taking into account the level and nature of non-audit services provided.

IAG non-audit services policy, key features

Pre-approval

All non-audit services require pre-approval in accordance with the table below to ensure services approved are 
consistent with the IAG non-audit services policy for permitted services. This process ensures all services fall 
within the scope of services permitted and pre-approved by the Committee and does not represent a delegation 
of authority for pre-approval.

Value
More than €100,000

Pre-approver
Audit and Compliance Committee Chair and Chief 
Financial Officer

Between €30,000 and €100,000

Chief Financial Officer and Head of Group Audit

Less than €30,000

Head of Group Audit

Fee cap 

The guideline amount is set to ensure the total fee payable for non-audit services should not exceed 70% of the 
annual audit fee.

The overall value of fees for work is addressed by a target annual maximum for 2023 of €2.4 million with an 
additional allowance of up to €1.5 million for large projects where the external auditor is uniquely placed to carry 
out the work.

The Committee reviews the nature and volume of the non-audit services undertaken by the external auditor 
on a quarterly basis.

Prohibitions

IAG’s policy includes a list of permitted non-audit services in line with the list of permitted services in the FRC’s 
Revised Ethical Standard 2019. Any service not on this list is prohibited.

All non-audit services over €100,000 are put to competitive tender with other providers, in line with the Group’s 
procurement policy, unless the skills and experience of the external auditor make it the only suitable supplier.

Details of the fees paid to the external auditor during the year can be found in note 7 to the Group financial statements.

Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present our 2023 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. This report 
includes both: (i) our 2023 Annual Report 
on Remuneration, detailing how our 
current Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
was implemented during 2023 and our 
proposed approach for 2024; and (ii) our 
proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
that is intended to apply from the date of 
our 2024 Annual General Meeting, in line 
with the three-year cycle in UK and 
Spanish remuneration regulations.

It has been an important year for IAG, in 
which the Group has continued its strong 
recovery after a very difficult period, 
delivering strong financial performance 
and having communicated our updated 
strategic and transformation plans to the 
market. In this context, the Committee 
continued to oversee the implementation 
of the Remuneration Policy during the 
period, focusing in particular on our 

existing remuneration framework and its 
possible evolution in the short and 
medium term. In discharging its 
responsibilities, the Committee has 
remained mindful of the need to 
continue to attract, retain and incentivise 
our senior executives, in what has 
continued to be a dynamic and tight 
labour market, while consistently taking 
into account the wider experience of the 
workforce, our shareholders and all 
other stakeholders.

Performance delivered in 2023
IAG achieved strong operating profits as 
we continue to transform our businesses 
to deliver world-class operating margins 
and returns on invested capital. This 
result led to strong cash generation in 
the year, strengthening our balance 
sheet, with net leverage back within 
IAG’s target range and improved credit 
ratings, and enabling us to invest in 
improving our customer experience.

The Group's performance has been 
against a background of continued 
uncertainty driven by the macroeconomic 
and geopolitical environment.

•  Operating profit before exceptional 

items €3,507 million;

•  Capacity recovered to 95.7% of 2019 

levels and more than 115 million 
passengers flown;

•  Significantly strengthened our balance 

sheet, reducing gross debt by 
€3.9 billion by the end of the year;
•  This improved financial position has 

enabled us to invest in our customers 
and brands, in products, services, and 
IT, as well as adding 32 new fuel-
efficient aircraft to the fleet; and
•  Significant progress towards 2025 
carbon efficiency target as IAG 
continues to lead the industry on 
sustainability

Workforce experience
Our workforce is at the heart of what we 
do, and their hard work has again been 
key to the strong performance we have 
delivered this year. On behalf of the 
Committee, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank our employees 
across the Group for their ongoing 
effort, flexibility, and commitment.

Our financial performance has enabled 
us to invest more in our people, and we 
have continued to focus on making IAG 
a fair and rewarding place, where our 
people can develop and succeed. In 
2023, our operating companies have 
made investments to improve colleague 
experience and our employee benefit 
packages. This includes enhanced 
flexible benefits offerings, mental and 
physical health offerings and financial 
wellbeing support. 

With respect to workforce remuneration, 
across our operating companies, almost 
90% of our employees are covered by 
collective bargaining agreements, many 
of which have been under review during 
2023. Each operating company has 
sought to reach collective agreements 
which best support colleagues, whilst 
ensuring the business and pay remains 
competitive and sustainable.

The Committee has received regular 
updates on workforce experience and, in 
particular, on the steps the operating 
companies have taken to support 
colleagues both in terms of cost-of-living 
challenges, and their overall wellbeing. All 
of the members of the Committee 
participate in the Board workforce 
engagement programme and have also 
used this opportunity to engage with 
employees on remuneration matters.

Financial StatementsCorporate GovernanceStrategic ReportReport of the Remuneration Committee continued

The Committee has used these insights 
to ensure our decisions regarding 
executive remuneration take into 
account the approach taken across our 
workforce and reflect the expectations 
of all our stakeholders.

2023 annual incentive outcome
There was no change to our annual 
incentive framework for 2023. 60% of 
the annual incentive was based on 
operating profit before exceptional 
items, 20% on customer NPS, 10% on 
carbon efficiency and 10% on strategic 
and personal objectives.

These measures were chosen to reflect 
the most important priorities of the 
Group for the year, with a focus on 
strong financial performance, delivering 
the best experience for our customers 
and the strategic importance of ESG and 
sustainability to the Group.

The Annual Incentive Plan operated in 
line with our Remuneration Policy and 
reflects the strong execution of our 
strategy in the year. Under the 
scorecard measures, the annual 
incentive outcome was 82.9% of the 
maximum opportunity. Whilst the 
outcome of our customer measure is 
below target, we performed well against 
our financial and carbon measures with 
both paying out at stretch performance. 
Customer continues to remain a key 
area of focus for both the management 
team and the Board. IAG is committed 
to provide a best-in-class customer 
experience and the Group will keep 
investing to further improve it. Full 
details of achievement against targets 
are provided in the variable pay 
outcomes section of this report. 

50% of the CEO’s award will be deferred 
into shares for three years. 

Vesting of the 2021 restricted share 
plan (RSP)
The first restricted share award was 
made in June 2021 and is due to vest in 
June 2024. In advance of this vesting, 
the Committee assessed the 
performance underpin which applies to 
the restricted share awards, taking into 
consideration IAG’s overall financial and 
non-financial performance.

As part of this process, the Committee 
was presented with a framework for it to 
use in order to assess whether the 
performance underpin had been 
satisfied, taking into account the 
performance for the financial years 2021, 
2022 and 2023. This incorporated detail 
on: IAG's financial performance 
(including revenue, profitability, 

operating margin, cash generation, 
return on capital, as well as performance 
relative to sector peers) and IAG's key 
non-financial and operational 
performance measures (including 
progress towards IAG's sustainability 
ambitions and its broader social 
agenda). The purpose of the framework 
was to ensure that the RSP vesting 
outcome can be justified and to guard 
against payment for failure.

The Committee agreed that, based on 
this assessment, the conditions set out in 
the underpin had been satisfied. As a 
result, it is expected that the 2021 RSP 
award for the IAG CEO will vest in full in 
June 2024. The estimated value of the 
award is included in the single total 
figure of remuneration in this year’s 
report. The award is subject to a 
two-year holding period.

Remuneration Policy review
In line with the three-year policy cycle, 
our Directors’ Remuneration Policy is 
due for renewal at our next Annual 
General Meeting in 2024. 

Our current Policy was developed at a 
time when the Group was significantly 
impacted by the biggest crisis the airline 
industry has ever faced. A key challenge 
for us at that time was to ensure that 
our remuneration framework remained 
effective in attracting and, crucially, 
retaining the executive talent necessary 
to drive the recovery of our business. In 
this context, and mindful of the 
challenge of setting long-term 
performance targets, we determined 
that the right approach for IAG was to 
introduce a restricted share plan, which 
would also allow our management team 
to focus on overcoming the crisis, while 
making the right decisions to ensure the 
long-term sustainability of the business. 

The Committee has undertaken a 
thorough review of our existing 
Remuneration Policy during the year, 
considering the Group’s strategic 
priorities, the macroeconomic 
environment, alternative remuneration 
frameworks and the effectiveness of the 
current Remuneration Policy; and 
concluded that the existing Policy 
continues to provide the most 
appropriate framework for aligning 
executive and shareholder interests at 
this time. 

We believe that the current 
macroeconomic and geopolitical 
environment, as the industry continues 
to stabilise post COVID-19, creates a 
level of uncertainty and volatility that 
makes it very challenging to design and 

set appropriate long-term performance 
targets, while effectively incentivising 
and retaining our senior executives. In 
addition, the Committee is mindful of the 
fact that none of the awards under the 
Company’s RSP have yet vested, with 
the first awards vesting in June 2024. As 
we continue to drive the recovery, we 
consider IAG’s RSP will continue to 
ensure focus on the long-term health of 
our business and our strategic 
transformation agenda.

While we propose to retain the current 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy structure 
and framework, we are recommending 
some minor amendments to ensure that 
we remain competitive over the short 
term, the key change being the 
reduction of the annual incentive 
deferral from 50% to 20%, to apply only 
when the executive has met the 
shareholding guidelines (350% of salary 
for the IAG CEO). In this way, any 
reduction in deferral would only apply 
where an executive already has a 
substantial shareholding, therefore 
maintaining alignment with shareholder 
interests. The Committee also considers 
this change is more closely aligned with 
practice amongst our sector and 
Spanish peers, for whom bonus deferral 
is uncommon.

Our proposed 2024 Directors' 
Remuneration Policy can be found at the 
end of this report.

Shareholder engagement
In developing our approach to our 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy review, 
we consulted with our major 
shareholders and main proxy advisory 
bodies. No concerns were raised with 
our Policy proposal, and we received 
valuable questions and feedback which 
will help shape our future discussions. I 
would like to thank all those 
shareholders who engaged with us 
during this process. 

Implementation of the Policy in 2024
Base salary 
The Committee seeks to ensure that the 
salary level for the IAG CEO is 
competitive in the context of a dynamic 
talent market in the geographies in 
which the Group operates and competes 
for talent. At the same time, the 
Committee is mindful of the current 
economic environment, the wider 
stakeholder experience, as well as 
investor and proxy advisor views. 
Following a detailed review, the 
Committee approved a salary increase 
of 4% for the IAG CEO for 2024. This is 
below the average increase for the wider 
workforce, which is more than 5%.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

This year the Remuneration Committee 
has again sought to take a responsible 
and considered approach to executive 
pay, taking into account the experience 
of our employees, shareholders and key 
stakeholders in the period. The 
Committee considers that the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy operated as 
intended during 2023, and the 
remuneration outcomes are fair and 
appropriate, considering the strong 
performance delivered in the year. I 
hope to receive your support for both 
our Remuneration Report and the 
renewal of our Remuneration Policy at 
our 2024 Annual General Meeting.

Annual incentive
In 2024, IAG continues to face 
significant uncertainty and volatility 
driven by external factors. In this 
context, we have sought to ensure that 
the annual incentive plan continues to 
align with business priorities and reflect 
the underlying performance of the 
business.

The Committee has decided that the 
maximum annual incentive opportunity 
will remain at 200% of salary for the IAG 
CEO in line with the Policy, and that 
there will be no change to the 
performance measures for 2024, as the 
Committee believes the current 
measures continue to reflect the most 
important priorities of the Group for the 
year ahead. The targets for 2024 will be 
fully disclosed in next year’s report.

Restricted share plan
The Group CEO will receive a restricted 
share award of 150% of salary in March 
2024 under the existing Remuneration 
Policy. The award will vest after three 
years subject to the satisfaction of the 
discretionary performance underpin and 
will also be subject to a holding period 
until five years from grant.

Looking forward
The Committee will continue to review 
the economic and business context and 
consider any changes that might be 
appropriate to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in the coming 
years. We will consult with our major 
shareholders and the main proxy 
advisory bodies (and seek approvals as 
required) in the next three years, to the 
extent that changes are proposed. As 
the Group returns to strong sustainable 
performance, there may come a time 
when it becomes appropriate to 
incentivise IAG’s management team to 
deliver our long-term financial and 
sustainability ambitions through robust 
long-term incentive targets. It is 
therefore our intention to keep our 
long-term incentive model under review 
to ensure that it remains effective.

From 1 January 2023: £852,800 
(€979,526) (an increase of 4% 
from 2022).

Below the average increase for the 
majority of the wider workforce.

Taxable benefits and Pension-related benefits
Provides basic 
retirement and benefits 
which reflect local 
market practice.

Pension at 12.5% of salary, 
comparable to the rate applicable to 
the majority of the UK workforce. 
Benefits provided as per policy.

Variable remuneration

Annual Incentive Plan
Incentivises annual 
corporate financial and 
non-financial 
performance and the 
delivery of role-specific 
objectives.

The deferred shares 
element aligns the 
interest of executives 
and shareholders and 
provides a retention tool.

For our 2023 bonus, our scorecard 
was weighted to the following 
measures: 60% Operating profit 
(before exceptional items), 20% 
customer NPS, 10% carbon efficiency 
and 10% personal objectives.

Under those scorecard measures, the 
bonus outcome was 82.9% of 
maximum, and thus the 2023 bonus 
amount of £1,414,000.

50% deferred into shares for three 
years.

Long-Term Incentive (RSP)
Incentivises long-term 
shareholder value 
creation, and retention.

The first restricted share award was 
made in June 2021 and is due to vest 
in June 2024. Based on the 
Committee's assessment of the 
performance underpin, the 
Committee expects that the RSP 
award will vest in full. The award will 
be subject to a two-year holding 
period post vesting.

More detail on the Committee's 
assessment can be found later in the 
report.

Shareholding requirement
Provides long-term 
alignment with 
shareholders.

The CEO of IAG is required to build 
up and maintain a shareholding of 
350% of base salary.

No change.

If a broad-based employee 
share plan is implemented, 
Executive Directors will be 
able to participate on the 
same basis as other 
employees.

Proposal to amend the 
approach to deferral of the 
annual incentive. Currently 
executives have to defer 50% 
of any bonus earned into 
shares for three years. We are 
proposing that, if the 
executive has met the 
shareholding guidelines (350% 
of salary for the IAG CEO), 
then the amount deferred 
will be reduced to 20%.

No change.

Following a review, an increase 
of 4% has been awarded. From 
1 January 2024: £886,912 
(€1,018,707).

Below the average increase for 
the wider workforce, which is 
more than 5%.

Benefits to be provided as per 
policy and pension will remain 
unchanged.

Maximum opportunity 
unchanged at 200% of base 
salary.

No change to the scorecard 
measures and weightings for 
2024.

In line with IAG’s remuneration 
policy, a restricted share award 
of 150% of salary will be granted 
to the IAG CEO in 2024. In line 
with previous years, the award 
will vest after three years 
subject to the satisfaction of the 
discretionary performance 
underpin and will also be 
subject to a holding period of 
two years post vesting.

No change to shareholding 
requirements. As at 
31 December 2023 the IAG CEO 
had a shareholding of 518% of 
base salary.

No change.

Malus and clawback provisions apply to Annual Incentive and Long-Term Incentive awards and 
the Committee has discretion to adjust formulaic outcomes to reflect corporate performance and 
broader stakeholders experience.

No change.

The Committee considers that the Directors’ Remuneration Policy operated as intended during 2023.

Alignment of IAG remuneration practices 
to Provision 40 of the UK Corporate Governance Code

UK Corporate Governance Code – Provision 40 

How we have achieved alignment

Clarity

Simplicity

Risk

Predictability

Proportionality

Alignment to culture

Our policy is that Executive Directors only participate in an annual bonus 
and a single restricted share plan, to ensure this simplicity. Incentive 
awards are capped so that the maximum potential award under each plan 
is transparent.

Our policy has improved the ability of participants, employees and 
shareholders to understand executive pay arrangements.

Additionally, the Company continues to make more remuneration analysis 
and information available to both employees and shareholders, via both 
UK and Spanish disclosures.

The design of our policy also ensures independent control over 
remuneration outcomes, with all executive variable pay being awarded on a 
discretionary basis and subject to malus and clawback provisions. Our 
corporate governance structure provides for a crossover in Board 
Committee membership between the Remuneration Committee and the 
Audit and Compliance Committee. This ensures a joined-up view between 
emerging or crystallised risks and remuneration outcomes. 

Our policy identifies the maximum opportunity for each component of 
executive remuneration and also illustrates potential total remuneration 
outcomes in various performance scenarios. These disclosures provide 
transparency around overall opportunities.

Our executive remuneration performance measures and targets are 
transparently disclosed where awards are made, detailing the relationship 
between the performance achieved and the delivery of our long-term 
strategy and the creation of sustainable shareholder value. The transparency 
of this approach supports proportionate remuneration outcomes relative to 
company and individual performance measures, as well as the wider 
performance environment.

The selection and balance of financial and non-financial measures for both 
short- and long-term incentives is designed to reinforce the values and 
behaviours that support the delivery of long-term sustainable returns to 
shareholders. In particular, the RSP, and overall proportion of deferred 
executive pay, enable a focus on transformation and long-term success.

Remuneration Report

Introduction
The Remuneration Committee takes responsibility for the 
preparation of the Report of the Remuneration Committee, 
which is approved by the Board.

The Company’s current policy on Directors’ remuneration was 
approved by shareholders at the Shareholders’ Meeting held on 
17 June 2021, and amended at the 2022 Shareholders’ Meeting, 
following close consultation with major shareholders.

In line with the three-year cycle in UK and Spanish 
remuneration regulations we will be submitting a new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy which will be put forward for shareholder 
approval at the 2024 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The 
proposed policy can be found later in this report.

As a Spanish incorporated company, IAG is subject to Spanish 
corporate law. The Spanish legal regime regarding Directors’ 
remuneration is substantially parallel to that of the UK as far as 
Directors' remuneration disclosure and approval requirements 
are concerned.

The Company welcomed the opportunity provided by the 
Spanish CNMV allowing companies to prepare free-format 
reports. Therefore IAG is presenting a consolidated report 
responding to Spanish and UK disclosure requirements. This 
report will be accompanied by a duly completed document 
which is required by the CNMV covering some relevant data. 
This is prepared in accordance with Spanish legislation and is 
available on the Company’s and the CNMV’s respective 
websites.

It is the Company’s intention once again to comply voluntarily 
with all reporting aspects of the UK legislation of 2018, The 
Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations (SI 
2018/860) and The Companies (Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
and Directors’ Remuneration Report) Regulations 2019, and to 
follow UK standards of best practice.

In addition to the Remuneration Committee Chair’s statement, 
this Directors’ Remuneration Report contains the Annual 
Report on Remuneration, which covers the information on 
Directors’ remuneration paid in the reported year.

Annual Remuneration Report 
The Annual Remuneration Report sets out how the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (as approved by shareholders at the 
Shareholders’ Meeting on 17 June 2021 and amended at the 
Shareholders’ Meeting held on 16 June 2022) was implemented 
in 2023 and how our proposed 2024 Directors' Remuneration 
Policy will be implemented in 2024.

The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is regulated by article 32 of the 
IAG Board Regulations and by its own Regulations approved on 
25 February 2021. A copy of these Regulations is available on 
the Company’s website.

Beyond executive directors, the Committee oversees the 
general application of the Remuneration Policy for the 
members of the IAG Management Committee (and considers 
remuneration matters related to other senior managers and the 
broader workforce across the Group).

Article 32 of the Board Regulations ensures that the 
Remuneration Committee shall be made up of no fewer than 
three independent non-executive directors, with the dedication, 
capacity and experience necessary to carry out their function. 
Heather Ann McSharry chairs the Committee and also holds 
Senior Independent Director responsibility. None of the 
Committee members has any personal financial interest, other 
than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided.

In accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Remuneration Committee also has responsibility to review 
workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment 
of incentives and rewards with culture.

The table below shows the consultative vote on the 2022 Annual Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 2023 Shareholders’ Meeting,

Financial StatementsCorporate GovernanceStrategic ReportAdvisers to the Committee
The Committee appointed Deloitte as its external adviser 
in September 2016. Deloitte reports directly to the Committee. 
The fees paid to Deloitte for advice provided to the 
Remuneration Committee during 2023 were £111,574 (€128,154), 
charged on a time and materials basis. Deloitte is a member of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to the 
voluntary UK Code of Conduct. As well as advising the 
Remuneration Committee, other Deloitte teams provided 
advisory services to other parts of the Group in 2023. The 
Committee has reviewed the remuneration advice provided by 
Deloitte during the year and is comfortable that it has been 
objective and independent.

In addition to Deloitte providing the Remuneration Committee 
with market updates on pay themes, the Committee also 
received market data and insights from other specialist 
consultants such as Aon, PwC and Willis Towers Watson 
in 2023.

2  2023 Long-term incentive: the value shown in this table represents the estimated value of the 2021 RSP award granted in June 2021, which is 

expected to vest in full in June 2024. The estimate is based on a three-month average share price from 1 October 2023 to 31 December 2023 of 152 
pence. Note that the value shown in this table differs from the value shown in the CNMV Statistical Annex accompanied to this report, as the 
reporting criteria established by the CNMV differ from those used in this table.

Additional explanations in respect of the single total figure table for 2023
Only the current IAG CEO, Luis Gallego, served as an executive director in 2023. As the sole executive director, the IAG CEO 
has confirmed in writing that he has not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than those already disclosed 
in the table above.

Base salary
The values shown represent the actual salary paid to the IAG CEO for each performance year. 

January 2022 marked the first point at which the IAG CEO received full contractual salary of £820,000 since appointment, following 
COVID-19 pandemic related salary reductions made since he assumed the CEO role, demonstrating the significant length of time pay 
reductions were in place.

For 2023, an increase of 4% was awarded, the first increase since appointment in 2020 and below the average increase for the wider 
workforce, which was more than 6%.

Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits include the provision of a company car, a fuel allowance, executive support services and private health insurances.

As disclosed in our 2022 Directors’ remuneration report, from January 2021 until December 2022 the IAG CEO was eligible for a 
transitionary allowance of £250,000 p.a. (gross), to reflect that as a result of his role he and his family now live in the UK. This 
allowance provided a two-year fixed period of transitionary support and considered that the IAG CEO continued to personally 
maintain a base in Madrid given the Company’s significant operations and business in Spain. The value of the transitionary allowance 
was not included in the calculation of any pension, incentive or other benefit values. Payment of the transitionary allowance ceased 
in December 2022.

Pension-related benefits
Employer’s contribution to pension scheme and/or cash in lieu of pension contribution.

Annual Incentive Plan
For our 2023 bonus, our scorecard was weighted to the following measures: 60% Operating profit (before exceptional items), 20% 
customer NPS, 10% carbon efficiency and 10% personal and strategic objectives.

Under those scorecard measures, the bonus outcome was 82.9% of maximum. The outcomes of the performance conditions which 
determined the award are described in detail later in the report. 

Under the current policy, 50% of any Annual Incentive award for executive directors is made in deferred shares under the Executive 
Share Plan. Under this plan, shares are deferred for three years from date of grant.

For 2022, the bonus outcome was 83.5% of maximum. Half of the annual incentive was deferred into shares for three years; these will 
vest in March 2026.

Long-term incentive vesting
In 2021 the existing performance share plan was replaced with a Restricted Share Plan (RSP). The first award was made to the IAG 
CEO in June 2021 and is due to vest in June 2024.

The Committee undertook an assessment of the performance underpin attached to the restricted share awards made in 2021 and 
agreed that, based on this assessment, the conditions set out in the underpin had been satisfied. As a result it is expected that the 
award will vest in full in June 2024.

More detail on the Committee's assessment can be found later on in the report.

Share price appreciation and depreciation
There is no value attributable to share price appreciation.

The Committee has not exercised any discretion as a result of share price appreciation or depreciation for any of the remuneration in 
the above table.

Life insurance
The Company provides life insurance and accidental death cover for executive directors. For the year ended 31 December 2023 the 
Company paid life insurance premium contributions of €17,050 (2022: €14,493).

Exchange rate for 2023
For the year to 31 December 2023, £:€ exchange rate applied is 1.1486 (2022: 1.1744).

Variable pay outcomes 
2023 Annual Incentive Plan
The IAG Annual Incentive Plan supports the business strategy through incentivising the delivery of identified priorities within the 
reporting period. The composition of measures selected reflects the most important priorities for the Group for the year to deliver 
long-term sustainable returns. For 2023, the Board at the beginning of the year, following a recommendation by the Committee, set 
the following measures:

60% Financial 

20% Customer 

KPI

Description

IAG Operating profit (before

For 2023 it was considered that Operating profit continued to 
be the most appropriate financial KPI in aligning shareholder 
interest with the Company

NPS is used to gauge the loyalty and experience of the Group’s 
customer relationships. It is calculated based on survey 
responses to the likelihood to recommend, by subtracting the 
percentage of customers who are ‘Detractors’ from the 
percentage of customers who are ‘Promoters’

The weighting of each airline towards the overall NPS score 
reflects the Group's areas of focus for 2023

This measure reflects our progress towards our Flightpath Net 
Zero 2050 commitment; it measures the fuel efficiency of our 
flight operations, taking account of our network, aircraft mix 
and passenger load factors

In 2023, the Group benefited from its high-quality and increasingly diverse revenue stream, with recovery seen in all our businesses 
and with particular strength in Spain and the North and South Atlantic. Passenger capacity operated across the year was close to 
the levels operated in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and we were able to generate higher unit revenues than in 2019, which 
offset higher fuel costs and supplier cost inflation. The results was a strong operating profit before exceptional items for the year of

Description of performance
The outcome for 2023 was 16.57 vs a target of 24.0. Disruptions, stemming from diverse factors such as air traffic control failures, strikes, 
adverse weather events, supply chain challenges, and baggage issues across key airports impacted negatively our NPS. To mitigate this 
impact our airlines responded proactively to these challenges through initiatives and transformation plans aimed at improving on-time 
performance and all baggage-related processes, among others. Positive impacts to our NPS can be attributed to substantial investment 
in our cabins and cabin product, the enhancement of food and drink offering, the effort to digitalise the customer journey, and the 
improvements in customer care. NPS continues to be a key area of focus for both management team and the Board.

IAG is on track to deliver its 2025, 2030 and 2050 climate targets by carrying out emission reduction initiatives, working in 
collaboration with key stakeholders and proactively advocating for supportive government policy and technology development. 
Key measures to reduce emissions are fleet modernisation, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), market-based measures including the 
UK and EU ETS and CORSIA, and carbon removals.

Description of performance
The Committee and the Board considered the CEO’s performance against the KPIs set out on the previous page and assessed his 
performance against each of those indicators. The IAG CEO has led the group’s recovery with passenger capacity close to pre-
pandemic levels and with strong operating profits. He has led the transformation of IAG, strengthening IAG’s position in core 
markets, delivering world-class operating margins and returns on invested capital. This result led to strong cash generation in the 
year, strengthening our balance sheet and with a clear plan and delivery against key transformation initiatives. This is a significant 
achievement particularly given the continued economic uncertainty and challenges faced across the year. The IAG CEO has also 
driven progress across the ESG agenda, increasing diversity and bench-strength of IAG’s senior leadership, and making significant 
progress towards its 2025 carbon efficiency target.

IAG Restricted Share Plan (RSP) awards
The RSP was introduced from 2021 to increase the alignment of both interests and outcomes between the Group’s senior 
management and shareholders through the build-up and maintenance of senior management shareholdings and an increased focus 
on the long-term, sustainable performance of the Company. The simplified structure and transparency of the RSP in comparison to 
the Performance Share Plan, also provided a better basis to attract and retain senior management talent.

A three-year vesting period and further two-year holding period applies to RSP awards for executive directors, with vesting being 
dependent upon a satisfactory review of the discretionary underpin by the Remuneration Committee. 

Malus and clawback provisions apply to RSP awards enabling the reduction of awards so far as nil value to further ensure that 
corporate or individual failure is not rewarded under the plan.

2021 Restricted Share Plan (RSP) award vesting
The first restricted share award was made in June 2021 and is due to vest in June 2024. In advance of the award vesting, the 
Committee undertook an assessment of the performance underpin which applies to the restricted share award and considers IAG’s 
overall financial and non-financial performance.

As part of this process, the Committee was presented with a framework to assess whether the underpin had been satisfied, taking 
into account the overall performance for the financial years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The different elements considered included:

•  The overall financial results for the period including IAG’s recovery from the pandemic. The Committee’s assessment took into 

account overall profitability, operating margins (including against comparable airlines), revenue, cash generation, return on capital 
and the Company’s investment in fleet, customer and transformation. The Committee was satisfied that the conditions of the 
underpin in this regard had been satisfied.

•  The Group's performance against key non-financial and operational performance measures, including progress towards IAG's 

sustainability ambitions and its broader social agenda (including diversity and inclusion). The Committee was satisfied that the 
conditions of the underpin in this regard had been satisfied.

•  IAG’s risk context, where the Group’s overall performance has been fundamentally in line with its approved risk appetite and 

internal control framework and no material issues have been identified.

•  The Group’s wider stakeholder experience in the period, which does not give rise to any material concerns.

The purpose of the framework was to ensure that the RSP outcome can be justified and to guard against payment for failure. 
The Committee agreed that, based on this assessment, the conditions set out in the underpin had been satisfied. As a result, 
it is expected that the 2021 RSP award will vest in full in June 2024. The award is subject to a two-year holding period.

No performance measures are associated with the awards. Vesting will be contingent on the satisfaction of 
a discretionary underpin, normally assessed over three financial years commencing from the financial year 
in which the award was granted. In assessing the underpin, the Committee will consider the Company’s 
overall performance, including financial and non-financial performance measures, as well as any material 
risk or regulatory failures identified. Financial performance may include elements such as revenue, 
profitability, cash generation, return on capital and benchmarked with comparable airlines. Non-financial 
performance may include a range of operational and strategic measures critical to the Company’s long-
term sustainable success. This assessment will ensure any value delivered to executive directors is fair and 
appropriate in the context of the performance of the business and experience of our stakeholders and that 
corporate or individual failure is not rewarded. In the case of significant failure on the part of the Company 
or the individual, vesting may be reduced, including to nil. Full disclosure of the Remuneration Committee’s 
considerations in assessing the underpin will be disclosed in the relevant Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Total pension entitlements
Luis Gallego is not a member of the Company’s pension scheme and the Company, therefore, did not pay any contributions in his 
time as an executive director during the reporting period (1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023). He received cash in lieu of 
contributions of £106,600. This value is equivalent to 12.5% of base salary paid during the financial year and is comparable to the rate 
for the majority of the UK workforce.

Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests
In order that their interests are aligned with those of shareholders, executive directors are required to build up and maintain a 
minimum personal shareholding in the Company.

Under the Group’s shareholding guidelines, the IAG CEO is required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 350% of salary and 
other executive directors are required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 200% of basic salary.

In addition, executive directors are required to retain all shares received via incentive plans until 100% of their shareholding 
requirement is attained.

The Committee has reviewed the IAG CEO’s progress against the requirement and notes that he is compliant with the policy 
requirement.

On departure, executive directors will be required to hold the number of shares in line with their in-employment shareholding 
requirement (or the number of shares that they own at departure if lower) for two years from their date of termination from the 
Group. Shares will normally be retained in the nominee account administered by the Company to ensure this.

unchanged for 2024, as they have been since 2011.

However, the Board, with the favourable report from the Remuneration Committee, agreed that the additional fee for holding the 
Chair of a Committee would increase to €30,000, with effect from 1 January 2024, for the Chair of the Audit and Compliance 
Committee and of the Remuneration Committee. This more closely reflects the complexity and time commitment of these roles.

Wider workforce in 2023 
A key area of focus for the Committee over 2023 has been understanding the broader workforce experience in light of the current 
economic environment and cost-of-living pressure and the actions taken to support our wider workforce.

Workforce experience highlights
•  Within IAG’s unique operating model, employee reward is owned and managed within each operating company, to enable them 

to deliver the right customer and employee experience.

•  Our employees have been central to our recovery and key to delivering for our customers. Operating companies continue to 

support our people through these challenging times and ensure our pay models are sustainable, fair and aligned to the 
operating company’s competitiveness.

•  Almost 90% of employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements with more than 30 collective bargaining agreements 

across the Group, many of them reviewed in 2023.

•  The Committee has received regular updates on workforce experience and in particular the steps the operating companies have 

taken to support colleagues both in terms of support with cost of living challenges, and their overall wellbeing.

•  This includes regular updates on the investments our operating companies have made in improving the colleague experience 
and our employee benefit schemes. This includes enhanced flexible benefits offerings (e.g. enhanced British Airways staff 
travel), mental health and physical health offerings (e.g. implementation of EAPs (employee assistance programmes) and free 
menopause support) and financial wellbeing support.

•  The Committee’s insight into the experience of our colleagues helps to ensure that our decisions regarding executive 

remuneration take into account the approach taken across our workforce and reflect the expectations of all our stakeholders.

Engaging with employees
All members of the 
Remuneration Committee 
participate as designated 
directors in the Board 
workforce engagement plan. 
This engagement also includes 
remuneration and other 
workforce experience matters 
relevant to the Committee.

The key themes from the 
engagement were shared with 
the Board in order to 
understand colleague 
experiences and to identify any 
areas for improvement. Further 
explanations of the Board 
engagement with employees is 
set out in the Stakeholders 
engagement section of the 
Corporate Governance report.

Gender pay
Operating companies have implemented a 
range of initiatives to support gender equality 
including reviewing recruitment processes to 
ensure diverse shortlists and interview panels, 
setting up mentoring and networking 
opportunities to women and providing 
educational programmes for girls and young 
women considering career paths in aviation.

As the Group built back resources during 2023, 
in particular in airport operations, customer 
and IT roles, the composition of the workforce 
has changed, with the resultant median pay 
point for both men and women changing 
compared to 2022. The result is that at Group 
level, there has been a year-on-year reduction 
in the median salary gap from 12.9% in 2022 
to 8.4% in 2023.

Workforce remuneration
Each operating company has sought to reach 
collective agreements that best support 
colleagues whilst ensuring the business and 
pay remains competitive. This has included 
changes in allowances, one-off payments and 
contractual pay increases throughout the 
Group.

Each operating company is committed to 
creating a positive working environment but 
also to actively contribute to and support the 
overall wellbeing of every colleague through 
the provision of a comprehensive range of 
health, financial, and lifestyle benefits.

Remuneration decisions made by the Committee align with our strategy, our stakeholders’ interest in our delivery of long-term 
sustainable value and with the wider workforce in line with the principles set out in our policy.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Alignment of Executive Director and workforce remuneration
The Committee has oversight of workforce remuneration and related policies across the Group and takes this into account when 
setting remuneration for the IAG CEO and senior management. The table below summarises the remuneration structure for the 
wider workforce.

IAG CEO

Below Board level

Base Salary 2023 was the first year since appointment in 2020 that 

the CEO received an increase. The 4% awarded was 
below the average increase for the majority of the wider 
workforce.

Salary increases as a percentage of salary are normally 
aligned with, or lower than, those of the wider workforce.

Taxable 
Benefits

Pension

Annual 
Incentive 
Awards

Benefit packages are broadly aligned with those of other 
employees who joined in the same country at the same 
time. 

Pension contribution of 12.5% of salary in line with the rate 
applicable to the majority of the workforce in the country 
in which the individual is based.

The maximum opportunity in the annual incentive plan is 
200% of salary.

The majority of the annual incentive is based on financial 
measures. In 2023, 60% was based on operating profit 
before exceptional items, 20% on customer NPS, 10% on 
IAG-specific carbon efficiency measure, to further drive 
progress towards our Flightpath Net Zero 2050 
commitment, and 10% on strategic and personal 
objectives. 

For 2023 50% of any bonus earned is deferred into shares 
for three years.

Almost 90% of our employees are subject to collective 
bargaining agreements (CBA). Many of them were 
reviewed over the course of 2023, with the aim to create 
a stronger link to market alignment and to ensure that 
pay is both competitive and sustainable.

Salary increase budgets for employees are determined 
by each operating company for each country.

Salary increases reflect position against market, 
performance, skills, contribution and development in role.

If we compare the 2023 base salary increases of the IAG 
CEO against the UK workforce in 2023, of the circa 
31,600 employees present in both 2022 and 2023, the 
median salary increase awarded was 10.3% of contractual 
base salary.

Benefits are set by operating companies at a competitive 
level and are appropriate given local market practice.

Pension arrangements reflect local market practices and 
requirements. 

For eligible employees incentive plans were in place 
against objectives designed to focus on financial, 
customers, carbon efficiency and personal. Opportunities 
vary by role and outturns and payments against these 
plans were managed at a local level. 

Long-term 
Incentives

Maximum restricted share plan opportunity of 150% of 
base salary and subject to the satisfaction of performance 
underpins.

Restricted share awards granted to senior managers 
across the Group to incentivise long-term shareholder 
value creation.

Awards are subject to a three-year vesting period 
followed by a two-year holding period.

Also by exception, other identified employees may 
participate where an award of long-term incentives is 
deemed critical to retention.

incentive elements in respect of 2023, payable to employees later in 2024, are modelled on an employee-by-employee basis against agreed 
frameworks. This approach enables fair and accurate comparison to the IAG CEO 2023 single total figure of remuneration.

3  To provide a fair and representative view to all remuneration received by UK employees, the 2021 basic salary and total remuneration figures include 
statutory and company top-up furlough payments. With the UK furlough scheme having ended in September 2021, this consideration is not relevant 
for 2022 or 2023.

4  The 2020 UK employee remuneration figures excluded all types of furlough payment and were representative of earnings for time worked but were 

not representative of the full level of pay received by employees and their actual remuneration experience.

The comparison in the ratio versus 2019 demonstrates the continuing impact of the pandemic and is an accurate reflection of the 
contraction in IAG CEO’s pay, with the IAG CEO’s remuneration currently being around 96% of 2019 levels. 

The increase in the UK employee remuneration in 2023 reflects:

•  Across our operating companies we have put in place a number of programmes to support our people through the current 

economic uncertainty.

•  Payments made to managers under the 2023 annual incentive plan.
•  Changes to the size and composition of the UK workforce between years, with pay for 36,474 employees being reported for 2022 

and 40,248 for 2023.

The change in the IAG CEO’s remuneration between 2022 and 2023, is due to:

•  An increase of 4% in basic salary for 2023, first increase since appointment in 2020 and below the average increase of the wider 

workforce (with no increase in 2021 and 2022, 10% reduction in 2021 and 20% reduction in 2020).

•  The inclusion of an estimated value of the 2021 RSP award, that is estimated to vest in full in June 2024.
•  As disclosed in our 2022 Director’s Remuneration Report, from January 2021 until December 2022 the Executive Director was 

eligible for a transitionary allowance of £250,000 p.a., to reflect that as a result of his role as IAG CEO, he and his family moved to 
live in the UK. This allowance provided a two-year fixed period of transitionary support. Payment of the transitionary allowance 
ceased in December 2022.

The Committee recognises that the current ratio continues to reflect recovery from the pandemic, and will continue to increase to a 
more representative level.

31 December 2020 and a 10% reduction operated for the full year in 2021.

2  Luis Gallego: An increase of 4% in basic salary for 2023 (below the average increase for the wider workforce) and no transitionary allowance. The 
comparison of 2021 vs 2022 reflects the first year since appointment in 2020 receiving full contractual salary and the first Annual Incentive Award

3  The uplift in fees for Javier Ferrán between 2020 and 2021 reflects his role as a non-executive director in 2020 and his assumption of the role of the 

Chairman from 7 January 2021, for the remainder of the reporting period.

4  The uplift in fees for Heather Ann McSharry between reflect her appointment as Senior Independent Director and Remuneration Committee Chair 

since June 2022.

5  The comparison of 2020 vs 2021 remuneration for Luis Gallego, Giles Agutter and Robin Phillips reflects a part year of director service and

The award granted on 6 March 2020 was tested at the end of the performance period. Threshold performance was not achieved for 
any measure and therefore the award lapsed in full (one third of the award was subject to TSR performance measured against a 
comparator index, one third was subject to adjusted EPS performance, and one third was subject to RoIC performance). 

The value attributed to the Company’s ordinary shares in accordance with the plan rules on the date of the PSP awards was 
2020: 459 pence; 2017: 546 pence; 2016: 541 pence; and 2015: 550 pence.

RSP awards are subject to a discretionary underpin prior to vesting. This review, performed by the Remuneration Committee, 
considers the Company’s overall performance, including financial and non-financial performance measures, as well as any material 
risk or regulatory failures identified. In the event of a significant failure on the part of the Company or the Executive Director, malus 
and clawback provisions are available to the Remuneration Committee.

The value attributed to the Company’s ordinary shares in accordance with the plan rules on the date of the RSP awards was 
2023: 153 pence (both awards in 2022: 141 pence and 2021: 198 pence).

Incentive Award Deferral Plan (IADP) 
Under the current policy, 50% of any Annual Incentive Award for executive directors is made in deferred shares under the Executive 
Share Plan. Under this plan, incentive award shares are deferred for three years from date of grant. The following table details the 
current Executive Director’s holdings of conditional awards over ordinary shares of the Company granted under the IAG IADP. 
Awards are shown for the performance periods ended 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2022.

No award was made in respect of 2020 (in March 2021) following the decision to cancel the 2020 IAG Annual Incentive Plan. 
Additionally, no award was made for 2021 (March 2022), as the IAG’s CEO confirmed to the Board that he did not wish to be 
considered for a 2021 Annual Incentive Award, waiving any 2021 incentive opportunity.

Under the Executive Share Plan rules an IADP will not lapse on leaving employment before the vesting date unless exceptional 
circumstances occur, such as gross misconduct, in which case the award would lapse in full. IADP awards are also subject to the 
policy’s malus and clawback provisions.

The values attributed to the Company’s ordinary shares in accordance with the plan rules for IADP awards (relating to the previous 
year’s performance) were 2020 award: 459 pence; and 2023 award: 153 pence.

The share price on the date of the vesting of the 2020 IADP award (6 March 2023) was 155 pence. The monetary value of the shares 
received was the share price on the date of the vesting multiplied by the number of shares in respect of the award vested, as shown 
in the table above.

2024 Directors’ Remuneration Policy

Introduction
Our current Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by 
shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting (and partially 
amended in 2022). In line with the three-year cycle in UK and 
Spanish remuneration regulations we will be submitting a new 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy which will be put forward for 
shareholder approval at the 2024 Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting. The proposed policy can be found below.

2024 Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section sets out the Directors’ Remuneration Policy of 
International Consolidated Airlines Group which will be put to 
shareholder approval at the 2024 Shareholders’ Meeting. 

This Directors' Remuneration Policy is adapted to the wording 
of article 529 novodecies of the Capital Companies Act, as 
amended by Law 5/2021 of 12 April, and shall apply, in 
accordance with the provisions of section 1 of said article 529 
novodecies, from the date of its approval by the 2024

Shareholders' Meeting and during the following three financial 
years. Any amendment or replacement thereof during such 
period shall require the prior approval of the Shareholders’ 
Meeting in accordance with the procedure established for its 
approval.

Although IAG, as a Spanish-incorporated company, is not 
subject to the remuneration reporting regulations that apply to 
UK-incorporated companies, it is firmly committed to UK best 
practice and will continue to operate in accordance with the UK 
remuneration reporting regulations.

In developing the proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy, 
input was received from the Remuneration Committee and 
management while ensuring that conflicts of interest were 
suitably mitigated. Input was also provided by the 
Remuneration Committee’s appointed independent advisers 
throughout the process.

IAG Remuneration Principles

Alignment

Simplicity and clarity

Competitiveness

Pay for performance

Judgement

Sustainability

Wider workforce 

Our remuneration policies promote long-term value creation, through transparent alignment 
with our corporate strategy.

We will keep our remuneration structures as simple and clear as possible to ensure they are 
understandable and meaningful to employees and shareholders.

Total remuneration will be competitive for the role, taking into account scale, sector, 
complexity of responsibility and geography. When setting senior executive pay, we will 
consider experience, external pay relativity, and the ability of IAG to compete for global talent.

We promote a culture where all employees are accountable for delivering performance. We 
will ensure there is alignment between performance and pay outcomes, with fair outcomes 
supported by corporate and individual performance and wider stakeholder experience. 
Depending on the level of the individual in the organisation, we use long-term equity to 
incentivise performance, shareholder value creation, and retention. Performance measures 
and targets will seek to balance collective success with a clear line of sight for participants. 
Remuneration outcomes aim to reflect the sustained long-term underlying performance of 
IAG.

We will use discretion and judgement to review formulaic performance outcomes to arrive at 
fair and balanced remuneration outcomes for both IAG and employees.

Our remuneration policies incentivise individual and corporate performance, support talent 
attraction and retention and promote sound risk management to enhance the sustainable 
long-term financial health of the Group. Individual contribution and values and behaviours will 
be reflected in remuneration outcomes.

We are committed to understanding the experience of all our colleagues. When setting senior 
executive pay we will use this insight to ensure all decisions regarding executive remuneration 
reflect the experience and expectations of all stakeholders. 

198

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Consideration of shareholder views
The Company consults regularly with its major investors on all 
matters relating to executive remuneration. The Company will 
engage in an extensive investor consultation exercise whenever 
there are any significant changes to remuneration policy.

In developing our approach to our Director’s Remuneration 
Policy review, we consulted with our major shareholders and 
main proxy advisory bodies. No concerns were raised with our 
Policy proposal, and we received valuable questions and 
feedback which will help shape our future discussions.

The Committee discusses each year the issues and outcomes 
from the annual Shareholders’ Meeting, and determines any 
appropriate action required as a result.

Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the 
Group
The Committee is updated on pay and conditions of the 
employees within the Group and takes this into account when 
considering executive directors’ remuneration. The Board is 
committed to understanding the experience of all our 
employees and uses its insight to ensure all decisions regarding 
executive remuneration reflect the experience and expectations 
of all stakeholders.

The pay of employees across all companies in the Group is 
taken into account when determining the level of any increase 
in the annual salary review of directors. This normally takes 
place each year at the January Committee meeting.

When determining the RSP awards for executive directors, the 
Committee takes note of the eligibility criteria and the potential 
size of awards for executives below director level in all 
companies within the Group.

At the operating company level, the Company consults with 
employee representative bodies, including trade unions and 
works councils. This includes consultation on company strategy, 
the competitive environment, and employee terms and 
conditions. In addition, some of the operating companies run 
employee opinion surveys in order to take into consideration 
employee views on a variety of subjects, including leadership, 
management, and the wider employee experience.

The IAG European Works Council (EWC) facilitates 
communication and consultation between employees and 
management on transnational European matters. It includes 
representatives from the different European Economic Area 
(EEA) countries, meeting regularly throughout the year to be 
informed and where appropriate, consulted on transnational 
matters impacting employees in two or more EEA countries.

Proposed changes to Directors’ Remuneration Policy
After a detailed review of the current Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy the Committee has concluded that the existing policy 
continues to provide the most appropriate framework for 
aligning executive and shareholder interests at this current 
time. As IAG returns to strong sustainable performance, the 
Committee believes there will be a time when it is appropriate 
to incentivise our CEO and his team to deliver our long-term 
financial and sustainability ambitions through robust long-term 
incentive targets. It is therefore our intention to keep our 
long-term incentive model under review to ensure that it 
continues to remain effective. We will consult with shareholders 
(and seek approvals as required) in the next three years to the 
extent that any changes are proposed.

While we propose to retain the current Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy structure and framework, the Committee is proposing 
some minor Policy amendments to ensure that we remain 
competitive over the short term, as outlined below:

•  Approach to annual bonus deferral: under our 2021 

remuneration policy, any annual bonus earned is paid 50% in 
cash, with 50% deferred into shares for three years. This 
deferral has been an important way of increasing personal 
shareholdings and satisfying the Group’s minimum 
shareholding requirements of 350% of salary for the CEO. 
Recognising that our control mechanism for ensuring 
alignment with shareholder interests is the minimum 
shareholding requirement itself, and that the minimum 
shareholding requirement can be fully met without the 
reliance on annual bonus deferral, under our 2024 
remuneration policy the Committee is proposing that the 
bonus deferral is rebalanced from 50% to 20% of any annual 
bonus earned deferred into shares, subject to the executive 
meeting their minimum shareholding requirement. The 
remaining 80% of the annual bonus earned will be paid in 
cash. The deferral rate will remain at 50% until the minimum 
shareholding requirement is met; and

•  If a broad-based employee share plan is implemented, 

Executive Directors will be able to participate on the same 
basis as other employees.

The Policy as shown on the following pages is intended to 
apply for three years, until 2027, taking effect from the date of 
approval.

Performance metrics

Individual and business 
performance are 
considered in reviewing 
and setting base salary.

Takes account of factors such as role, skills and 
contribution.

The positioning of base salaries is set with 
reference to factors such as the external market, 
as well as the individual’s skills and contribution. 
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually, and 
normally take effect on 1 January each year.

Benefits include, but are not limited to, life 
insurance, personal travel and, where applicable, a 
company car, fuel, and private health insurance. 
Executive directors may also participate in any 
broad-based employee share plans that may be 
operated by the Company on the same basis as 
other eligible employees.

Where appropriate, benefits may include 
relocation, international assignment costs and tax 
advisory services. Executives will also be 
reimbursed for all reasonable expenses.

The Company operates a defined contribution 
scheme as a percentage of salary, and all executive 
directors are eligible for membership. Executives 
can opt instead to receive a salary supplement in 
lieu of a pension (in full or in part).

Base salaries are normally 
reviewed annually by the 
Remuneration Committee 
by taking into account 
factors such as: company 
affordability, the value 
and worth of the 
executive, retention risks, 
and the size of pay 
increases generally across 
the wider workforce.

There is no formal 
maximum. In general, the 
Company expects to 
maintain benefits at the 
current level. The 
maximum value for any 
broad-based employee 
plans will be in line with 
the maximum value for 
eligible employees.

The level of employer 
contribution for executive 
directors, expressed as a 
percentage of basic 
salary, will be in line with 
the rate applicable to the 
majority of the workforce 
in the country in which 
the executive director is 
based. For the UK 
workforce, this is 
currently 12.5% of basic 
salary.

Performance metrics

The majority of the 
annual incentive is 
subject to financial 
measures. Measurable 
non-financial measures 
may include, but are not 
limited to, strategic, 
personal, customer and 
ESG objectives. 

For the bonus deferral 
award, no other 
performance conditions 
apply because it is based 
on performance already 
delivered.

The maximum 
opportunity in the 
incentive plan is 200% of 
salary. Each performance 
metric in the incentive 
plan is independent. For 
each performance metric 
in the incentive plan, 
there will normally be no 
payment at all until 
performance for that 
particular metric has 
reached the threshold 
level of the target range. 
50% of the maximum will 
be awarded for on-target 
performance, and the 
maximum for each 
element will only be 
awarded once a stretch 
target has been reached.

The Board, on a recommendation from the 
Remuneration Committee, sets the measures 
and targets that apply to the annual incentive 
award which are normally measured over a 
single financial year. These are set by reference 
to a number of factors, including the Business 
Plan (as approved by the Board), and the 
Group’s strategic focus.

The Board, after considering the recommendation 
of the Committee, retains the discretion to adjust 
the formulaic outcome of awards in order to, in its 
opinion, properly reflect overall corporate 
performance – see the ‘Information supporting the 
policy tables’ section.

Once the minimum shareholding requirement is 
met, 20% of the annual incentive award is 
normally deferred into shares which will normally 
be released after a period of three years.

Where the executive has not met their minimum 
shareholding requirement, 50% of the annual 
incentive award is normally deferred into shares 
which will normally be released after a period of 
three years. 

On vesting, executives will receive the benefit of 
any dividends paid over the deferred period in 
the form of dividend equivalent payments.

Malus and clawback provisions apply – see the 
‘Information supporting the policy tables’ 
section.

Performance metrics

The face value of the 
award(s) will not exceed 
150% of salary in respect of 
any financial year.

The RSP consists of an award of the 
Company’s shares which normally 
vests as long as the executive 
remains employed by the Company 
at the time of vesting and subject to 
the assessment of the underpin.

Malus and clawback provisions 
apply – see the ‘Information 
supporting the policy tables’ 
section.

Following the assessment of the 
underpin, there is normally an 
additional holding period of at least 
two years.

No performance measures are associated 
with the awards.

Vesting will be contingent on the 
satisfaction of a discretionary underpin, 
normally assessed over three financial 
years commencing from the financial 
year in which the award was granted. In 
assessing the underpin, the Committee 
will consider the Company’s overall 
performance, including financial and 
non-financial performance, as well as any 
material risk or regulatory failures 
identified. Financial performance may 
include elements such as revenue, 
profitability, cash generation, return on 
capital and benchmarked with 
comparable airlines. Non-financial 
performance may include a range of 
operational and strategic measures 
critical to the Company’s long-term 
sustainable success. Whilst the RSP 
provides a greater certainty of reward by 
its very nature, the Committee will ensure 
any value delivered to executive 
directors is fair and appropriate in the 
context of the performance of the 
business and experience of our 
stakeholders and that corporate or 
individual failure is not rewarded. In the 
case of significant failure on the part of 
the Company or the individual, vesting 
may be reduced, including to nil. Full 
disclosure of the Committee’s 
considerations in assessing the underpin 
will be disclosed in the relevant Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.

Shareholding requirements
In order to increase alignment with shareholders, executive 
directors are required to build up a minimum personal 
shareholding equal to a set percentage of base salary. The 
share price used to calculate the guideline is either the share 
price on the date of award or on the date of vesting/exercise. 
Executive directors will be required to retain the entire 100% of 
shares (net of tax) which vest from share plans until their 
respective shareholding requirement is attained. The IAG CEO 
is required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 350% of 
basic salary, and other executive directors (to the extent they 
are appointed to the Board) are required to build up and 
maintain a shareholding of 200% of basic salary.

On departure, executive directors will be required to hold the 
number of shares in line with their in-employment shareholding 
requirement (or the number of shares that they own at 
departure if lower) for two years from the date they step down 
from the Board. Shares will normally be retained in the nominee 
account administered by the Company to ensure this.

Choice of performance measures
The performance measures selected for the annual bonus are 
ordinarily set on an annual basis by the Committee, to ensure 
that they remain appropriate to reflect the priorities for the 
Company in the year ahead. The targets for the performance 
measures are set taking into account a number of factors, 
including the Company’s annual operating plan, strategic 
priorities, the economic environment and market conditions 
and expectations. Non-financial annual bonus measures may 
include strategic, personal, customer and ESG objectives. 

Malus and clawback provisions

provisions

Circumstances

The Board, following the advice of the Committee, has authority to reduce or cancel awards 
before they are satisfied (and/or impose additional conditions on awards), and to recover 
payments, if special circumstances exist. These special circumstances include (but are not 
limited to):

•  Fraud;
•  Material breach of any law, regulation or code of practice;
•  An error or a material misstatement of results leading to overpayment or over-allocation;
•  Misconduct;
•  Failure of risk management;
•  The occurrence of an exceptional event affecting the Company’s value or reputation;
•  Payments based on results that are subsequently found to be materially financially 

inaccurate or misleading;

•  Serious reputational damage as a result of a participant’s behaviour; 
•  Corporate failure; and
•  Any other circumstances in which the Board considers it to be in the interests of 

shareholders for the award to lapse or be adjusted.

Period

•  For the cash element of the annual incentive plan, clawback provisions apply for three years 

from the date of payment;

•  For the bonus deferral awards, there will be three years from the date of award in which 
shares can be withheld, i.e. the entire period from the date of the award until vesting;

•  For RSP, clawback provisions apply for two years post vesting; and 
•  The proportion of an award to be withheld or recovered will be at the discretion of the 
Board, upon consideration of the Committee, taking into account all relevant matters.

Discretion to adjust formulaic outcomes
The Board, after considering the recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee, retains the discretion to adjust 
(including preventing them in their entirety and making no 
payment) the formulaic outcome of incentive award payments 
in order to, in its opinion, properly reflect overall corporate 
performance. This includes where the business has had an 
exceptional event, in particular events that significantly impact 
stakeholders. This will include analysing the performance of the 
participant and the underlying financial performance of the 
Group to check whether they have been satisfactory in the 
circumstances and whether vesting levels reflect overall 
corporate performance. The Remuneration Committee can also 
take other factors it considers relevant into account. Underlying 
financial performance is defined as the overall performance of 

the Company, which may be considered with reference to a 
range of measures as the Remuneration Committee considers 
most appropriate at the time. Stakeholders would include 
shareholders, customers, and the Company’s workforce. The 
Board also has authority to reduce the award levels at grant 
and/or the vesting outcomes for the RSP where the Company 
has experienced a significant fall in share price, as a result of 
which it considers that participants have unduly benefited from 
windfall gains.

Benefits, expenses and taxation
The Board may arrange to settle any taxes and associated 
expenses payable if it deems such settlement appropriate, 
including, but not limited to tax on benefits or where, without 
such settlement, the executive will be subject to double 
taxation on the same remuneration amount.

Non-executive directors
The table below summarises the main elements of remuneration for non-executive directors:

Purpose and  
link to strategy 

Basic fees

Fees take into 
account the level of 
responsibility, 
experience, abilities 
and dedication 
required.

Benefits

Operation of element of policy

Fees are normally set with reference to factors such as market 
positioning.

To acknowledge the key role of the Chair of the Board of Directors, fees 
are set separately for this role. Additional fees may be paid for 
undertaking additional Board responsibilities such as undertaking the role 
of Senior Independent Director or for holding a Committee chair position. 

Non-executive director fees will take into account external market 
conditions to ensure it is possible to attract and retain the necessary 
talent. There is no specific review date set, but it is the Company’s 
intention to review fees from time to time.

Non-executive directors (including the Board Chair) are entitled to use air 
tickets of the airlines of the Company or related to the Company in 
accordance with the terms and conditions established, from time to time, in 
the Personal Travel Policy for IAG Non-Executive Directors approved by 
the Board.

As provided for under article 37.8 of the Company’s Bylaws and by way of 
development of that article, this benefit may also be provided to non-
executive directors after they have ceased to hold office if the Board 
considers it appropriate and in accordance with the terms and conditions 
set out from time to time in the Personal Travel Policy for IAG Non-
Executive Directors approved by the Board. The terms and conditions 
applicable to former non-executive directors may differ from those 
applicable to current directors and may be subject to additional conditions 
or restrictions (such as a minimum period of service or a maximum period 
of entitlement, fixed or variable, after leaving office) as determined by the 
Board from time to time.

Maximum opportunity

The maximum annual 
aggregate gross 
remuneration (including 
annual basic fees and 
benefits, including travel 
benefits) payable to 
directors shall not exceed 
€3,500,000 as approved 
by the Shareholders’ 
Meeting on 19 October 
2010, in accordance with 
article 37.3 of the 
Company’s Bylaws.

The maximum total annual 
gross amount of the personal 
travel benefit is €500,000 for 
all non-executive directors 
taken together (including any 
former non-executive 
director who may be entitled 
to this benefit at any given 
time).

Service contracts and exit payments policy Executive 
directors
The following is a description of the key terms of the service 
contracts of executive directors.

The service contracts are available for inspection, on request, at 
the Company’s registered office.

The contracts of executive directors are for an indefinite period.

There are no express provisions in executives' service contracts 
with the Company for compensation payable upon termination 
of those contracts, other than for payments in lieu of notice.

Executive director Date of contract

Notice period

Luis Gallego

8 September 2020

6 months – from / 
12 months – given

The period of notice required from the executive is six months; 
the period of notice required from the Company is 12 months. 
Where the Company makes a payment in lieu of notice, a 
payment becomes payable only if, in the Company’s opinion, 
the executive has taken reasonable steps to find alternative 
paid work and then only in monthly instalments. The payments 
will comprise base salary only. The Company may reduce the 
sum payable in respect of any month by any amount earned by 
the executive (including salary and benefits) referable to work 
done in that month (for example, as a result of alternative paid 
work referred to above).

In the event of an executive's redundancy, compensation, 
whether in respect of a statutory redundancy payment or a 
payment in lieu of notice or damages for loss of office, is 
capped at an amount equal to 12 months’ base salary. The 
Company will honour the contractual entitlements of a 
terminated director; however, the Company may terminate an 
executive's service contract with immediate effect and without 
compensation on a number of grounds including where the 
executive is incapacitated for 130 days in any 12-month period, 
becomes bankrupt, fails to perform his or her duties to a 
reasonable standard, acts dishonestly, is guilty of misconduct 
or persistent breach of his or her duties, brings the Company 
into disrepute, is convicted of a criminal offence, is disqualified 
as a director, refuses to agree to the transfer of his or her 
service contract where there is a transfer of the business in 
which he or she is working or ceases to be eligible to work in 
Spain or the UK (as applicable).

The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments 
(including, for example, appropriate legal or outplacement fees) 
in connection with an executive director’s cessation of office or 
employment where the payments are made in good faith in 
discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages 
for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement of 
any claim arising in connection with the cessation of an 
executive director’s office or employment.

Under any of the Company’s share plans, save in respect of 
bonus deferral awards (which will normally vest in full following 
cessation for any reason) if a director leaves, the Board, after 
considering the recommendation of the Remuneration 
Committee, may exercise its discretion (within the rules of the 
schemes) to grant good leaver status. This can be granted in 
certain circumstances including for example (list not 
exhaustive) the director leaving for reasons of ill-health, injury 
or disability, redundancy, retirement or death. Executive 
directors leaving with good leaver status will normally receive a 
pro-rata amount of their RSP shares, subject to the underpin 
being met, in accordance with the plan rules. The pro-ration is 
normally calculated according to what proportion of the 
vesting period the executive director spent in company service. 
Normal vesting dates, holding periods, and post-cessation 
shareholding guidelines will normally continue to apply, other 
than in a limited number of exceptional circumstances in 
accordance with plan rules and/or at the discretion of the 
Board. If good leaver status is not granted to an executive 
director, all outstanding awards made to them will normally 
lapse.

Executive directors leaving with good leaver status are eligible 
to receive a pro-rata annual incentive payment for the period of 
the year actually worked, subject to the regular performance 
assessment and normally paid in the normal manner following 
the year end.

In the event of an executive director’s termination from the 
Company, they must not be employed by, or provide services 
to, a restricted business (i.e. an airline or travel business that 
competes with the Company) for a period of 12 months.

Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors (including the Chair) do not have 
service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Board 
Regulations and the Company’s Bylaws. They do not have the 
right to any compensation in the event of termination as 
directors. Board members shall hold office for a period of one 
year. The non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are 
available for inspection, on request, at the Company’s 
registered office.

206

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Notes to the policy tables
The Board may make any remuneration payments and 
payments for loss of office (and exercise any discretions 
available to it in connection with such payments) which are not 
in line with this remuneration policy, where the terms of the 
payment were agreed (i) before this policy came into effect 
(provided that they were in line with any applicable directors’ 
remuneration policy in force at the time they were agreed) or 
(ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of 
the Company and such payment was not, in the Board’s 
opinion, in consideration of the individual becoming a director. 
For these purposes ‘payments’ include the Board satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration and, in respect of a share 
award, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the 
award is granted. The Board may also make remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office outside of the policy 
set out above if such payments are required by law in a 
relevant country.

Common award terms
Awards granted under the share plans may be adjusted in the 
event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or any 
demerger, special dividend or other event that may affect the 
current or future value of the awards.

External non-executive directorship
The Company’s consent is required before an executive can 
accept an external non-executive appointment and permission 
is only given in appropriate circumstances. The Company 
allows the executive to retain any fee from such appointments.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The remuneration for new executive directors will be in line 
with the policy for current executive directors as far as possible, 
as expressed in the policy table earlier in this report.

On appointment, new executive directors will have their basic 
salary set by taking into account factors such as the external 
market, their peers, and their level of experience. New executive 
directors will participate in the annual and long-term incentives 
on the same basis as existing directors.

To facilitate recruitment, the Board, after considering the 
recommendation of the Committee, may make one-off awards 
to buy out a candidate’s remuneration arrangements that are 
forfeited as a result of joining the Company. Generally, such 
buy-out awards will be made on a comparable basis to those 
forfeited giving due regard to all relevant factors (including 
value, performance targets, the likelihood of those targets 
being met and vesting periods). In such circumstances, 
shareholders will be provided with full details and rationale in 
the next published remuneration report.

Excluding the value of any potential buy-out, the maximum 
value of variable remuneration offered at recruitment will be no 
more than the maxima shown in the remuneration policy table.

In the case of an internal promotion to executive director, the 
Company will continue to honour any commitments made 
before promotion.

Other than that, the remuneration arrangements on recruitment 
will be as above.

Non-executive directors recruited will be remunerated in line 
with the Company’s remuneration policy principles outlined 
before.

Notes to the accounts
For the year to 31 December 2023

1 Background and general information

International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (hereinafter ‘International Airlines Group’, ‘IAG’ or the ‘Group’) is a leading European 
airline group, formed to hold the interests of airline and ancillary operations. IAG (hereinafter the ‘Company’) is a Spanish company 
registered in Madrid and was incorporated on 17 December 2009. The registered address of IAG is El Caserío, Zona industrial 2, 
Camino de La Muñoza s/n, 28042, Madrid, Spain. On 21 January 2011, British Airways Plc and Iberia Líneas Aéreas de España S.A. 
Operadora (hereinafter ‘British Airways’ and ‘Iberia’ respectively) completed a merger transaction becoming the first two airlines of 
the Group. Vueling Airlines S.A. (‘Vueling’) was acquired on 26 April 2013, and Aer Lingus Group Plc (‘Aer Lingus’) on 18 August 
2015. A list of the subsidiaries of the Group is included in the Group investments section.

IAG shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities and also on the stock exchanges of Madrid, 
Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia (the ‘Spanish Stock Exchanges’), through the Spanish Stock Exchanges Interconnection System 
(Mercado Continuo Español). 

2 Significant accounting policies

Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards as endorsed by the European Union (IFRSs as endorsed by the EU). The consolidated financial statements are rounded to 
the nearest million unless otherwise stated. These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention except for 
certain financial assets and liabilities, including employee benefit assets and liabilities, the €825 million convertible bond due 2028, 
derivative financial instruments and other equity investments that are measured at fair value. The notes to the financial statements 
for the prior year include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current year presentation.

The Group’s financial statements for the year to 31 December 2023 were authorised for issue, and approved by the Board of 
Directors on 28 February 2024.

Change in presentation of results

Income statement – Net gain on sale of property, plant and equipment
The prior year Income statement includes a reclassification to conform with the current year presentation for the Net gain on sale of 
property, plant and equipment within Operating profit. Accordingly, for the year to 31 December 2022, the Group has reclassified 
€22 million of gains from Other non-operating credits to Net gain on sale of property, plant and equipment within Expenditure on 
operations. There is no impact on the Profit after tax. The segmental operating profit/(loss) has been updated to reflect the 
reclassification.

Statement of other comprehensive income
The prior year Statement of other comprehensive income includes a reclassification of €173 million of gains associated with the fair 
value movements on cash flow hedges and €9 million of losses associated with the fair value movements on cost of hedging, which 
had been previously presented under the sub-heading Items that will not be reclassified to net profit, to the sub-heading Items that 
may be reclassified subsequently to net profit, as these may recycle to net profit in future periods. There is no impact on Total other 
comprehensive (loss)/income for the year, net of tax.

Cash flow statement
The prior year Cash flow statement has been represented and further detailed in note 37. Accordingly, the Group has reclassified the 
results for the year to 31 December 2022.

Going concern
At 31 December 2023, the Group had total liquidity of €11,624 million (31 December 2022: total liquidity of €13,999 million), 
comprising cash, cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits of €6,837 million, €4,412 million of committed and undrawn general 
facilities and a further €375 million of committed and undrawn aircraft specific facilities. At 31 December 2023, the Group has no 
financial covenants associated with its loans and borrowings.

The decrease in liquidity during the year to 31 December 2023 was attributable to, amongst other actions: (i) the repayment of 
borrowings of €4,268 million, which consisted of, amongst others, the €2,330 million (£2.0 billion) early repayment of the UK Export 
Finance (UKEF) Credit Facility, the €867 million of early repayment of the syndicated financing agreement, partially guaranteed by 
Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) in Spain and the €500 million redemption of the senior unsecured bond at maturity; (ii) securing an 
additional five-year Export Development Guarantee Facility of €1,159 million (£1.0 billion), offset by a reduction in aircraft specific 
facilities of €741 million; and (iii) offset by strong operational cash flow generation.

In its assessment of going concern, the Group has modelled two scenarios referred to below as the Base Case and the Downside 
Case over the period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of these consolidated financial statements (the ‘going 
concern period’). The Group’s three-year business plan, used in the creation of the Base Case, was prepared for and approved by the 
Board in December 2023. The business plan takes into account the Board’s and management’s views on capacity, based on the 
potential impact of the wider economic and geopolitical environments on the Group’s businesses across the going concern period. 
The key inputs and assumptions underlying the Base Case through to 31 March 2025, include:

• capacity recovery modelled by geographical region with total capacity to remain above the levels obtained in 2023 throughout 

the going concern period; 

• passenger unit revenue per ASK is forecast to remain above the levels obtained in 2023 throughout the going concern period; 

216

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

• the Group has assumed that the committed and undrawn general facilities of €4,412 million will not be drawn over the going 

concern period. The availability of certain of these facilities reduces over time, with €3,843 million being available to the Group at 
31 March 2025;

• the Group has assumed that the undrawn aircraft facilities of €375 million, relating to specific financing structures, will be utilised 

over the going concern period;

• the Group has assumed that the €500 million bond that matures in March 2025 will not be refinanced; 
• of the capital commitments detailed in note 15, €3,207 million is due to be paid over the period to 31 March 2025; 
• while the Group does not expect to finance all expected deliveries over the going concern period, for those it does expect to 
finance, it has forecast securing between 90 and 100 per cent depending on aircraft type, or €2,235 million, of the aircraft 
financing that is currently uncommitted, to align with the timing and payments for those aircraft deliveries it expects to finance, 
including aircraft delivered in 2023 that had not had their financing secured at the reporting date; and

• the Group has assumed that the relevant approvals required in relation to the acquisition of the remaining 80 per cent of the share 
capital of Air Europa Holdings that it does not currently own are obtained by the end of the going concern period, and that cash 
outflows of €149 million will be incurred, comprising €100 million of the cash consideration and €49 million for the purchase of 
ordinary shares in the Company that have not already been purchased at the balance sheet date. The deferred consideration of 
€100 million to be paid on the first anniversary and the €100 million to be paid on the second anniversary of the completion of the 
acquisition are assumed to occur outside of the going concern period and accordingly not included in these forecasts. 

The Downside Case applies stress to the Base Case to model adverse commercial and operational impacts over the going concern 
period, represented by: reduced levels of capacity operated in each month, including reductions of 25 per cent for three months 
over the going concern period; reduced passenger unit revenue per available seat kilometre (ASK); increases in the price of jet fuel 
by 20 per cent above that assumed in the Base Case; and increased operational costs. In the Downside Case, over the going concern 
period capacity would be 10 per cent down when compared to the Base Case. The Downside Case assumes that British Airways 
would be required to draw down, in full, its portion of the available US dollar Revolving Credit Facility (further information given in 
notes 3 and 29f). The Downside Case also assumes that upon completion of the Air Europa Holdings acquisition, a further €200 
million of working capital needs are funded by the Group. The Directors consider the Downside Case to be a severe but plausible 
scenario. 

Having reviewed the Base Case and the Downside Case, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient 
liquidity to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these consolidated 
financial statements and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements at 31 
December 2023.

Consolidation
The Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, each made up to 31 December 
together with the attributable share of results and reserves of associates and joint ventures, adjusted where appropriate to conform 
to the Group’s accounting policies.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, which is the date on which the Group obtains control and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration paid is the fair value of the assets 
transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in 
a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Non-controlling interests represent the 
portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented separately within equity in 
the Consolidated balance sheet. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, as at the acquisition date the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through the Income statement.

Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling 
interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

All intragroup account balances, including intragroup profits, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Unconsolidated structured entities
The Group regularly uses sale and leaseback transactions to finance the acquisition of aircraft. In certain instances, the Group will 
undertake several such sale and leaseback transactions at once through Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs). Under 
each of these financing structures, a company or companies (the EETC Issuer) are established to facilitate such financing on behalf 
of a number of unrelated investors. In certain of these financing structures, additional special purpose vehicles (the Lessor SPV) are 
established to provide additional financing from a number of further unrelated investors to the EETC Issuer. The proceeds from the 
issuance of the EETCs by the EETC Issuer, and where relevant the proceeds obtained from the Lessor SPV, are then used to 
purchase aircraft solely from the Group. The Group will then enter into fixed rate lease arrangements (which meet the recognition 
criteria of Asset financed liabilities) with the EETC Issuer, or where relevant the Lessor SPV, with payments made by the Group to 
the EETC Issuer, or the Lessor SPV, distributed, through a trust, to the aforementioned unrelated investors. The main purpose of the 
trust structure is to enhance the credit-worthiness of the Group’s debt obligations through certain bankruptcy protection provisions 
and liquidity facilities, and also to lower the Group’s total borrowing cost.

The EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPV are established solely with the purpose of providing the asset-backed financing and upon 
maturity of such financing are expected to have no further activity. The relevant activities of the EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPV are 
restricted to pre-established financing agreements and the retention of the title of the associated financed aircraft. Accordingly, the 
Group has determined that each EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPVs are structured entities. Under the contractual terms of the 
financing structures, the Group has no exposure to losses in these entities, does not own any of the share capital of the EETC Issuer 
or the Lessor SPV, does not have any representation on the respective boards and has no ability to influence decision-making.

Corporate GovernanceStrategic ReportFinancial Statements2 Significant accounting policies continued
In addition to the above, such financial transactions expose the Group to no further significant financial or economic risks, such as no 
variability over time in interest rates.

In considering the aforementioned facts, management has concluded that the Group does not have access to variable returns from 
the EETC Issuers and Lessor SPVs because its involvement is limited to the payment of principal and interest under the arrangement 
and, therefore, it does not control the EETC Issuers or the Lessor SPVs and as such does not consolidate them.

Further information as to the financial impact of these financial transactions is given in note 26.

Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with how resource allocation decisions are made by the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for resource allocation and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the IAG Management Committee.

Foreign currency translation

a Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the functional currency, being the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. In particular, British Airways and IAG Loyalty have a 
functional currency of pound sterling. The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group’s 
presentation currency.

b Transactions and balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency using the rate of exchange prevailing on the date 
of the transaction. Monetary foreign currency balances are translated into the functional currency at the rates ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at balance 
sheet exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income statement, 
except where hedge accounting is applied. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and 
liabilities classified as non-current on the Balance sheet are recognised within Net currency retranslation credits/(charges) in the 
Income statement. All other gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in 
operating profit.

c Group companies

The net assets of foreign operations are translated into euros at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Profits and 
losses of such operations are translated into euros at average rates of exchange during the year. The resulting exchange differences 
are taken directly to a separate component of equity (Currency translation reserve) until all or part of the interest is sold, when the 
relevant portion of the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the Income statement.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are held at cost. The Group has a policy of not revaluing property, plant and equipment. Depreciation 
is calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value on a straight-line basis, over the economic life of the asset. 
Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market values for equivalently aged assets and 
depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis.

a Fleet

All aircraft are stated at the fair value of the consideration given after taking account of manufacturers’ credits and pre-delivery 
instalment payments (referred to as progress payments). Fleet assets owned or right of use (‘ROU’) assets are disaggregated into 
separate components and depreciated at rates calculated to write down the cost of each component to the estimated residual value 
at the end of their planned operational lives (which is the shorter of their useful life or lease term) on a straight-line basis. 
Depreciation rates are specific to aircraft type, based on the Group’s fleet plans, within overall parameters of 23 years and up to 5 
per cent residual value for short-haul aircraft and between 23 and 29 years (depending on aircraft) and up to 5 per cent residual 
value for long-haul aircraft. 

Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the aforementioned depreciation rates. Where the lease 
includes a purchase option, at the discretion of the Group, where it is expected that the purchase option will be exercised, the 
associated right of use asset is depreciated using the aforementioned depreciation rates to reflect the reasonably certain life of the 
aircraft, irrespective of the lease term.

Cabin interior modifications, including those required for brand changes and relaunches, are depreciated over the lower of 12 years 
and the remaining economic life of the aircraft, whether owned or leased.

Aircraft and engine spares acquired on the introduction or expansion of a fleet, as well as rotable spares purchased separately, are 
carried as property, plant and equipment and generally depreciated in line with the fleet to which they relate.

b Other property, plant and equipment

Provision is made for the depreciation of all property, plant and equipment. Property, with the exception of freehold land, 
is depreciated over its expected useful life over periods not exceeding 50 years, or in the case of leasehold properties, over the 
duration of the lease if shorter, on a straight-line basis. Equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from four to 20 years.

c Capitalisation of interest on progress payments

Interest costs attributed to progress payments made on account of aircraft and other qualifying assets under construction are 
capitalised and added to the cost of the asset concerned. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income statement in the 
year in which they are incurred.

218

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Notes to the accounts continuedd Liquidated damages

Certain of the Group’s contractual arrangements with aircraft and engine manufacturers contain liquidated damage clauses, whereby 
if the supplier breaches one or more contractual clauses (such as delays in the timing of delivery of an aircraft or engine) then 
damages are payable to the Group. Liquidated damages are recognised in the Income statement only to the extent that they relate 
to compensation for loss of income and/or incremental operating costs, when a contractual entitlement exists, the amounts can be 
reliably measured and the receipt is virtually certain. When liquidated damages do not relate to compensation for loss of income 
and/or incremental operating costs, the amounts are recorded as a reduction in the cost of the associated aircraft in the Balance 
sheet and depreciated over the life of the aircraft.

When compensation, not related to the loss of income and/or incremental operating costs, is received in advance of the associated 
delivery of the aircraft and/or engine, the Group recognises the amount within Other creditors until such time as the aircraft and/or 
engine is delivered, at which time the amounts are transferred and recorded as a reduction in the cost of the associated asset. Such 
compensation is recorded in the Cash flow statement within cash flows from investing activities under the caption of Acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

e Leases

The Group leases various aircraft, properties, equipment and other assets. The lease terms of these assets are consistent with the 
determined useful economic life of similar assets within property, plant and equipment.

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified tangible asset for a period in exchange for consideration. The Group 
has elected not to apply such consideration where the contract relates to an intangible asset, such as for landing rights or IT 
software, in which case payments associated with the contract are expensed as incurred. 

Leases are recognised as a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by 
the Group.

Right of use assets
At the lease commencement date a ROU asset is measured at cost comprising the following: the amount of the initial measurement 
of the lease liability; any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and any 
initial direct costs. In addition, at the lease commencement date a ROU asset will incorporate unavoidable restoration costs, such as 
the removal of airline-specific branding and configuration, to return the asset to its original condition, for which a corresponding 
amount is recognised within Provisions. The ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on 
a straight-line basis. If ownership of the ROU asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the 
exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.

Lease liabilities
Lease liabilities are initially measured at their present value, which includes the following lease payments: fixed payments (including 
in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate; 
amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group 
is reasonably certain to exercise that option; payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group 
exercising that option; and payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options. 

Aircraft lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The interest rate implicit in the lease is the 
discount rate that, at the inception of the lease, causes the aggregate present value of the minimum lease payments and the 
unguaranteed residual value to be equal to the fair value of the leased asset and any initial indirect costs of the lessor. For aircraft 
leases these inputs are either observable in the contract or readily available from external market data. The initial direct costs of the 
lessor are considered to be immaterial. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, the Group entity’s incremental 
borrowing rate is used. 

Each lease payment is allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the Income statement over 
the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability for each period. 
After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the 
lease payments made.

The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification of the lease contract, a re-assessment of the lease 
term (specifically in regard to assumptions regarding extension and termination options) and changes in variable lease payments 
that are based on an index or a rate.

Amounts excluded from recognition as lease liabilities
The Group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or 
less and those leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised 
on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Income statement. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less, 
that do not contain a purchase option. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.

The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in 
the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability 
is re-assessed and adjusted against the ROU asset. Extension options are included in a number of aircraft, property and equipment 
leases across the Group and are reflected in the lease payments where the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the 
option. Such variable lease payments are expensed to the Income statement as incurred.

Corporate GovernanceStrategic ReportFinancial Statements2 Significant accounting policies continued

Sale and leaseback transactions
The Group regularly uses sale and lease transactions to finance the acquisition of aircraft. Each transaction is assessed as to whether 
it meets the criteria within IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ for a sale to have occurred. The principal criterion for 
assessing whether a sale has occurred or not, is whether the contract contains the option, at the discretion of the Group, to 
repurchase the aircraft over the lease term; with the existence of such a repurchase option resulting in a sale having been deemed 
not to have occurred; and if no such repurchase option exists, then a sale is deemed to have occurred. The following defines the 
accounting for such transactions:

• if a sale is determined to have occurred, then the associated asset is de-recognised and a ROU asset and lease liability are 

recognised. The ROU asset recognised is based on the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that is retained. 
Any gain or loss is restricted to the amount that relates to the rights that have been transferred to the counterparty to the 
transaction; and

• where a sale is determined to have not occurred, the asset is retained on the Balance sheet within Property, plant and equipment 

and an Asset financed liability recognised equal to the financing proceeds.

Cash flow presentation – lease liabilities
Lease payments are presented as follows in the Consolidated cash flow statement:

• where the proceeds received from sale and leaseback transactions represent the fair value of the asset being transferred, the total 

proceeds are presented within cash flows from investing activities. Where the proceeds received from sale and leaseback 
transactions exceed the fair value of the asset being transferred, the element of the proceeds equivalent to the fair value of the 
asset being transferred is presented within investing activities and the amount of proceeds in excess of the fair value is presented 
within financing activities; 

• the repayments of the principal element of lease liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities; 
• the payments of the interest element of lease liabilities are included within cash flows from operating activities; and 
• the payments arising from variable elements of a lease, short-term leases and low-value assets are presented within cash flows 

from operating activities.

Cash flow presentation – asset financed liabilities
Payments associated with asset financed liabilities are presented as follows in the Consolidated cash flow statement:

• the proceeds received from asset financed liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities;
• the repayments of the principal element of asset financed liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities; and
• the payments of the interest element of asset financed liabilities are included within cash flows from operating activities.

Lessor accounting
From time to time the Group will lease, to third parties, specific assets, including certain property, plant and equipment. On inception 
of the lease, the Group determines whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.

In order to make this determination, the Group assesses whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. Factors in making this assessment include, but are not limited to, whether the lease term is for the major 
part of the economic life of the underlying asset and whether the underlying asset transfers to the lessee or the lessee has the option 
to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease. Where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred, then the lease is recorded as a finance lease, otherwise it is recorded as an operating lease.

f Maintenance, repairs and overhaul

Owned aircraft
Major overhaul expenditure, including replacement spares and labour costs for airframes and engines, is capitalised and amortised 
over the expected life between major overhauls or to the end of the useful life of the asset.

All other replacement spares and other costs relating to maintenance of owned fleet assets (including maintenance provided under 
‘pay-as-you-go’ contracts) are charged to the Income statement on consumption or as incurred respectively.

Leased aircraft
The Group records a provision for major maintenance and overhaul events, including for airframes and engines, that occur through 
usage or through the passage of time that is recognised as such activity occurs through to the next maintenance event, with a 
corresponding expense recorded in the Income statement. Any subsequent changes in estimation are recognised in the Income 
statement. When the maintenance and/or overhaul event occurs, the associated provision is de-recognised. 

Restoration and handback obligations that arise on the inception of a lease are recognised as a provision with a corresponding 
amount recognised as part of the ROU asset. Any subsequent change in estimation relating to such costs are reflected in the ROU 
asset.

All other replacement spares and other costs relating to maintenance of leased fleet assets (including maintenance provided under 
‘pay-as-you-go’ contracts) are charged to the Income statement on consumption or as incurred respectively.

Notes to the accounts continuedIntangible assets

a Goodwill

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and represents the excess of the consideration paid 
over the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Where the net fair value of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of the acquiree is in excess of the consideration paid, a gain on bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the Income 
statement.

For the purpose of assessing impairment, goodwill is grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash 
flows (cash generating units). Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever indicators exist that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.

b Brands

Brands arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Long established brands 
that are expected to be used indefinitely are not amortised but assessed annually for impairment.

c Customer loyalty programmes

Customer loyalty programmes arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. A 
customer loyalty programme with an expected useful life is amortised over the expected remaining useful life. Established customer 
loyalty programmes that are expected to be used indefinitely are not amortised but assessed annually for impairment.

d Landing rights

Landing rights acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Landing rights acquired from 
other airlines are capitalised at cost.

Capitalised landing rights based outside of the UK and the EU are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding 20 
years. Capitalised landing rights based within the UK and the EU are not amortised, as regulations provide that these landing rights 
are perpetual.

e Contract-based intangibles

Contract-based intangibles acquired in a business combination are recognised initially at fair value at the acquisition date and 
amortised over the remaining life of the contract.

f Software

The cost to purchase or develop computer software that is separable from an item of related hardware is capitalised separately and 
amortised on a straight-line basis generally over a period not exceeding five years, with certain specific software developments 
amortised over a period of up to ten years.

In certain instances, the Group enters into cloud computing arrangements with third-party providers, such as software as a service 
(SaaS), where the Group is provided the right to access and use the application software over the contract term. At inception of the 
contract, the Group will assess whether such an arrangement gives rise to the recognition of a software intangible asset. 

Where the Group determines that no software intangible asset should be recognised, the cloud computing arrangement is 
determined to be a service contract and the associated fees paid are expensed as incurred. In addition, the costs incurred for both 
the customisation and configuration of the application software are generally expensed as incurred.

g Emissions allowances

Where an operating company purchases emissions allowances these amounts are recognised at cost and recorded within Intangible 
assets. As an operating company emits CO2 equivalent and builds up an obligation to the relevant authorities, a provision is 
recognised.

Emissions allowances recorded within Intangible assets are not revalued or amortised but are tested for impairment whenever 
indicators exist that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For those obligations arising for which the operating company has 
purchased emission allowances to offset the emissions, the provision is recognised at the weighted average cost of the intangible 
asset. For those obligations arising for which the operating company has not yet purchased emission allowances to offset the 
emissions, the provision is recognised at the market price of the allowances required at the reporting date. As the provision is 
recognised, a corresponding amount is recorded in the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and emission charges.

The Group’s emissions obligation, recognised as a separate liability, is extinguished when the associated emission certificates are 
surrendered, which is typically within 12 months of the reporting date.

From time to time the Group enters into sale and repurchase transactions for specified emission allowances. Such transactions do 
not meet the recognition criteria of a sale under IFRS 15 and accordingly the asset is retained on the Balance sheet within Intangible 
assets and an Other financing liability recognised equal to the proceeds received.

Corporate GovernanceStrategic ReportFinancial Statements2 Significant accounting policies continued

Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are 
subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the value by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and value-in-use. Non-financial assets other 
than goodwill that were subject to an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

a Property, plant and equipment, including Right of use assets

The carrying value is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be 
recoverable and the cumulative impairment losses are shown as a reduction in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.

b Intangible assets

Intangible assets are held at cost and are either amortised on a straight-line basis over their economic life, or they are deemed to 
have an indefinite economic life and are not amortised. Indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Investments in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term equity interest and over which it has the power to exercise 
significant influence. Where the Group cannot exercise control over an entity in which it has a shareholding greater than 51 per cent, 
the equity interest is treated as an associate undertaking.

A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when 
decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations made in 
determining significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.

Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, and initially recognised at cost. The Group’s 
interest in the net assets of associates and joint ventures is included in Investments accounted for using the equity method in the 
Balance sheet and its interest in their results is included in the Income statement, below operating result. The attributable results of 
those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.

Financial instruments

a Financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified, upon initial recognition, as measured at amortised cost, at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (OCI), or fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets and financial liabilities are not reclassified 
subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets.

The classification of financial assets and financial liabilities at initial recognition depends on the financial assets’ and financial 
liabilities’ contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. In order for a financial asset or 
financial liability to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 
‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. A financial asset or financial liability that is not 
SPPI is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. This assessment is performed on an instrument by instrument 
basis.

The Group’s business model for managing financial assets and financial liabilities establishes how it manages its financial assets and 
financial liabilities in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting 
contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets and financial liabilities classified and measured at 
amortised cost are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows 
while financial assets and financial liabilities classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held within a business model with 
the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling.

Long-term borrowings
Long-term borrowings are recorded at amortised cost, including lease liabilities which contain interest rate swaps that are closely 
related to the underlying financing and as such are not accounted for as an embedded derivative.

Convertible debt
Convertible bonds are classified as either compound financial instruments or hybrid financial instruments depending on the 
settlement alternatives upon redemption. Where the bondholders exercise their equity conversion options and the Group has no 
alternative other than to settle the convertible bonds into a fixed number of ordinary shares of the Company, then the bonds are 
classified as a compound financial instrument. Where the Group has an alternative settlement mechanism to the convertible bonds 
that permits settlement in cash, then the convertible instrument is classified as a hybrid financial instrument. 

Convertible bonds that are classified as compound financial instruments consist of a liability and an equity component. At the date 
of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible 
debt, and is subsequently recorded on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion 
or maturity of the bonds, and is recognised within Borrowings. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond 
and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the 
Group, is included in the equity portion of the convertible bond in Other reserves and is not subsequently remeasured. The interest 
expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability 
component of the instrument. The difference between this value and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability.

222

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Notes to the accounts continuedConvertible bonds that are classified as hybrid financial instruments consist only of a liability component recognised within 
Borrowings. At the date of issue, the entirety of the convertible bonds is accounted for at fair value with subsequent fair value gains 
or losses recorded within Borrowings. The fair value of such financial instruments is obtained from their respective quoted prices in 
active markets, with the portion of the change in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of the convertible bonds 
recognised in Other comprehensive income and the portion of the change in fair value attributable to market conditions recognised 
in the Income statement within Finance costs. 

Issue costs associated with compound financial instruments are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the 
convertible bonds where appropriate based on their relative carrying values at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity 
component is charged directly against equity. Issue costs associated with hybrid financial instruments are expensed immediately to 
the Income statement.

Other equity investments
Other equity investments are non-derivative financial assets including listed and unlisted investments, excluding interests in 
associates and joint ventures. On initial recognition, these equity investments are irrevocably designated as measured at fair value 
through Other comprehensive income. They are subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in Other 
comprehensive income with no recycling of these gains and losses to the Income statement when the investment is sold or a change 
in the structure of transaction changes its classification as an Other equity instrument. Dividends received on other equity 
investments are recognised in the Income statement.

The fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.

Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.

Financial instruments held for trading
Financial instruments are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of selling the associated asset in the near 
term and not having been purchased for operational purposes. 

By entering into short-term forward sales contracts, the Group seeks to optimise capital allocation while minimising the associated 
economic risk.

Interest-bearing deposits
Interest-bearing deposits, principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions with contractual cash flows 
that are SPPI, and held in order to collect contractual cash flows, are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Impairment of financial assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group recognises provisions for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised 
cost, based on either 12-month or lifetime losses depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition. The simplified approach, based on the calculation and recognition of lifetime expected credit losses, is applied to 
contracts that have a maturity of one year or less, including trade receivables.

When determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and when estimating the 
expected credit loss, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available. This includes both 
quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment, 
including forward-looking information. Such forward-looking information takes into consideration the forecast economic conditions 
expected to impact the outstanding balances at the balance sheet date. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable 
expectation of recovery, such as the customer having filed for liquidation.

b Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits with any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand or 
maturing within three months of the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

c Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and hedging activities

Derivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate swap derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives and fuel derivatives 
(including options, swaps and forward contracts) are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. They are classified as financial instruments through the Income statement. The 
method of recognising the resulting gain or loss arising from remeasurement depends on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged (as detailed below under cash flow hedges). The time value of 
options is excluded from the designated hedging instrument and accounted for as a cost of hedging. Movements in the time value of 
options are recognised in Other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects the Income statement.

When forward contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Group generally designates only the spot component of the 
forward contract as the hedging instrument within a hedge relationship. The effective portion of gains or losses arising on the 
change in fair value of the spot component are recognised within Other comprehensive income in the Cash flow hedge reserve 
within equity. The forward component of a forward contract is not designated within a hedge relationship, with the associated gains 
and losses on the forward component recorded within Other comprehensive income in the Cost of hedging reserve within equity 
until the underlying transaction affects the Income statement.

To manage foreign exchange movements on foreign currency customer cash inflows (denominated in US dollars, euros and 
Japanese yen), certain non-derivative repayment instalments on foreign currency-denominated interest-bearing liabilities are 
designated as hedging instruments within a hedge relationship. The effective portion of gains or losses arising from movements in 
foreign exchange rates are recognised within Other comprehensive income in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. 
Accumulated gains or losses within the cash flow hedge reserve are transferred to Sales in advance of carriage in the same period as 
the forecast transaction occurs or when hedge accounting is discontinued when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, at which point amounts are immediately reclassified to the Income statement.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

223

Corporate GovernanceStrategic ReportFinancial Statements2 Significant accounting policies continued
When a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and that instrument expires, is sold or is restructured, if the initial forecast 
transaction is still expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until such time as the hedge 
item impacts the Income statement. Where there is a change in the risk management objective, then hedge accounting is 
discontinued and the associated cumulative gain or loss arising prior to the change in risk management objective remains in the cash 
flow hedge reserve until such time as the underlying hedged item impacts the Income statement had the risk management objective 
continued to have been met. Where a forecast transaction which was previously determined to be highly probable and for which 
hedge accounting applied, is no longer expected to occur, hedge accounting is discontinued and the cumulative gain or loss in the 
cash flow hedge reserve is immediately reclassified to the Income statement.

Each operating company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts, that are not designated in a hedge relationship, in order 
to mitigate foreign exchange movements on financial liabilities designated in currencies other than the presentational currency of 
each operating company, including but not limited to, lease liabilities. Movements in the fair value of such derivatives are recognised 
in the Income statement in the period in which they occur and are presented within Net currency retranslation charges.

Exchange gains and losses on monetary investments are taken to the Income statement unless the item has been designated and is 
assessed as an effective hedging instrument. Exchange gains and losses on non-monetary investments are reflected in equity.

d Cash flow hedges

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as in a cash flow hedge relationship of a highly probable 
expected future transaction are assessed for effectiveness and accordingly recorded in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. 

Hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness 
assessments, to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. A hedging 
relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements: (i) there is ‘an economic 
relationship’ between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii) the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes 
that result from that economic relationship; and (iii) the hedge ratio is aligned with the requirements of the Group’s risk management 
strategy and in all instances is maintained at a ratio of 1:1.

The Group assesses whether the derivative designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge relationship is expected to be on 
inception and at each reporting date effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical 
derivative model.

Sources of ineffectiveness include the following:

• in hedges of fuel purchases, ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally 

estimated, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty;

• in hedges of foreign currency purchases, ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was 

originally estimated, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty;

• in hedges of interest rate payments, ineffectiveness may arise if there are differences in the critical terms between the interest rate 

derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative 
counterparty; and

• in all hedges, ineffectiveness may arise if there are differences between the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the 

hypothetical derivative, such as where on inception of the hedge relationship the fair value of the hedging instrument is not zero.

Ineffectiveness is recorded within the Income statement as Realised/unrealised (losses)/gains on derivatives not qualifying for hedge 
accounting and presented within Other non-operating credits.

Reclassification and transfer adjustments
Gains and losses accumulated in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity are either reclassified from the Cash flow hedge reserve 
when the hedged item affects the Income statement, or transferred from the Cash flow hedge reserve when the hedged item gives 
rise to recognition in the Balance sheet as follows:

• where the forecast hedged item results in the recognition of expenses within the Income statement (such as the purchase of jet 

fuel for which both fuel and the associated foreign currency derivatives are designated as the hedging instrument), the 
accumulated gains and losses recorded in both the Cash flow hedge reserve and the Cost of hedging reserve are reclassified and 
included in the Income statement within the same caption as the hedged item is presented. Such reclassification occurs in the 
same period as the hedged item is recognised in the Income statement;

• where the forecast hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (such as the purchase of aircraft for which 
foreign currency derivatives are designated as the hedging instrument or where the purchase of jet fuel gives rise to the 
recognition of fuel inventory in storage facilities), or a non-financial liability (such as the sales in advance of carriage for which both 
foreign currency derivatives and non-financial derivative instruments are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated 
gains and losses recorded within both the Cash flow hedge reserve and the Cost of hedging reserve are transferred and included 
in the initial cost of the asset and liability, respectively. These gains or losses are recorded in the Income statement as the non-
financial asset and the non-financial liability affects the Income statement (which for aircraft is through Depreciation, amortisation 
and impairment over the expected life of the aircraft, for fuel inventory through Fuel, oil costs and emission charges when it is 
consumed and for sales in advance of carriage through Passenger revenue when the flight is flown); and

• where the forecast hedged item results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability (such as variable rate debt for which 

interest rate swaps are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated gains and losses recorded within the Cash flow 
hedge reserve are reclassified to the Income statement to Interest expense within Finance costs at the same time as the interest 
income or expense arises on the hedged item.

Further information on the risk management activities of the Group is given in note 29.

Notes to the accounts continuede Fair value hedges

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated in a fair value hedge relationship are recorded within the 
Income statement as Net change in the fair value associated with fair value hedges within Other non-operating credits. The change 
in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is recorded as part of the overall carrying amount of the 
hedged item and is recorded within the Income statement as Net change in the fair value associated with fair value hedges within 
Other non-operating credits.

For fair value hedges associated with financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, any adjustment to the carrying value is 
amortised to the Income statement from the date of the cessation of the hedge relationship through to the maturity of the hedged 
item using the effective interest rate method.

If the hedged item is de-recognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the Income statement.

Ineffectiveness included in fair value hedges of interest rate payments may arise if there are differences in the critical terms between 
the interest rate derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the 
derivative counterparty.

f Interest rate benchmark reform

In 2020 the Group adopted the amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 relating to the interest rate benchmark reform Phase 1, (‘Phase 1’) 
and in 2021 the Group adopted the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to the interest rate benchmark 
reform Phase 2 (‘Phase 2’).

The Phase 1 amendments provide temporary relief from applying certain hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships 
directly affected by Interbank Offered Rates (‘IBOR’) reform. The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform does not cause hedge 
accounting to terminate prior to contracts being amended. Where transition to an alternative benchmark rate has taken place, the 
Group ceases to apply the Phase 1 amendments and instead applies the Phase 2 amendments.

Hedge accounting
During the course of 2023, the Group ceased to apply the Phase 1 amendments, as the last of the associated IBORs transitioned to 
alternative benchmarks. Prior to these transitions and where the Group applied the Phase 1 amendments, the following reliefs were 
applied:

• when considering the highly probable requirement, the Group assumed that those benchmark rates that needed to be transitioned 
to an alternative benchmark rate, on which the Group’s hedged long-term borrowings were based, did not change as a result of 
IBOR reform;

• in assessing whether the hedge was expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis the Group assumed that those 
benchmark rates that needed to be transitioned to an alternative benchmark rate, on which the cash flows of the hedged long-
term borrowings and the interest rate swaps that hedge them were based, were not altered by IBOR reform; and

• the Group has not reclassified the Cash flow hedge reserve relating to the period after the IBOR reform is expected to take effect.

When the Group ceased to apply the Phase 1 amendments, the Group amended its hedge designation to reflect changes which are 
required by IBOR reform, but only to make one or more of the following changes:

• designating an alternative benchmark rate (contractually or non-contractually specified) as the hedged risk;
• amending the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows being hedged; or
• amending the description of the hedging instrument.

The associated hedge documentation was updated to reflect these changes in designation by the end of the reporting period in 
which the changes were made. Such amendments did not give rise to the hedge relationship being discontinued.

When the Group transitioned to alternative benchmark rates, the accumulated amounts within the cash flow hedge reserve were 
determined to be based on the alternative benchmark rates and no reclassification adjustments were made from the cash flow 
hedge reserve to the Income statement.

Long-term borrowings and lease liabilities
Phase 2 of the amendments required that, for financial instruments measured using amortised cost measurement, changes to the 
basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform are reflected by adjusting their effective 
interest rate prospectively. No gain or loss was recognised upon transition to the new benchmark. The expedient was only applicable 
to direct changes that are required by interest rate benchmark reform.

For lease liabilities where there was a change to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows, as a practical expedient the 
lease liability was remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a discount rate that reflected the change in the 
interest rate where the change was required by IBOR reform. 

No amounts have been recorded in the current or prior periods as a result of these amendments.

Employee benefit plans

a Pension obligations

The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 
Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions 
if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior 
years.

Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent 
on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the 
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years. The benefit is 
discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the 
balance sheet date on AA-rated corporate bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the 
Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the net 
obligation calculation results in an asset for the Group, the recognition of an asset is limited to any future refunds, net of the relevant 
taxes, from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan (‘the asset ceiling’). The fair value of the plan assets is based on 
market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. The fair value of insurance policies which 
exactly match the amount and timing of some or all benefits payable under the scheme are deemed to be the present value of the 
related obligations. Longevity swaps are measured at their fair value.

Current service costs are recognised within employee costs in the year in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised in the 
event of a plan amendment or curtailment, or when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or severance obligations. The 
net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period 
to the net defined benefit liability or asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability or asset during the 
period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest and other expenses related to the defined benefit plans are 
recognised in the Income statement. Remeasurements, comprising IAS 19 gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding 
interest) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income. 
Remeasurements are not reclassified to the Income statement in subsequent periods.

b Severance obligations

Severance obligations are recognised when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever 
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises a provision for severance 
payments when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed 
formal plan without realistic possibility of withdrawal, or providing severance payments as a result of an offer made to encourage 
voluntary redundancy.

Other employee benefits are recognised when there is deemed to be a present obligation.

c Flight crew provisions

The Group’s obligations in respect of flight crew provisions are calculated separately for each collective bargaining agreement. In 
estimating these obligations, the Group makes assumptions regarding the number of employees that will elect to take early 
retirement under these agreements, and the age at which they make this election (where relevant), using the probability weighted 
methodology. The Group recognises a provision for service costs from the date of employment of the relevant individual, with the 
corresponding amount recorded within the Income statement. The provisions recognised are discounted, at the reporting date and 
the effect of unwinding of these discount rates are recognised as a finance cost in the Income statement. 

Remeasurements of the provisions are made for changes in financial assumptions and recorded in Other comprehensive income. The 
Group records changes through Other comprehensive income, where assumptions regarding the elections to be made by individuals 
differs to actual elections. These calculations are performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

Taxation
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:

• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 

business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries or associates, where the timing of the 

reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and

• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 

the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when 
the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date.

Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax 
is recognised in the Income statement.

226

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Notes to the accounts continuedInventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Such cost is determined by the weighted average cost method. 
Inventories include mainly aircraft spare parts, repairable aircraft engine parts and fuel held in storage facilities.

Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based payment plans, under which the Group awards equity instruments of 
the Group for services rendered by employees. The fair value of the share-based payment plans is measured at the date of grant 
using a valuation model provided by external specialists. The resulting cost, as adjusted for the expected and actual level of vesting 
of the plan, is charged to the Income statement over the period in which the options vest. At each balance sheet date before vesting, 
the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management’s best 
estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, and accordingly the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the Income 
statement with a corresponding entry in equity.

Treasury shares
When the share capital of the Company is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable 
transaction costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity within the treasury share reserve. When treasury shares are sold or 
reissued, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting gain or loss on the transaction is presented as 
an adjustment to Retained earnings with no gain or loss recorded in the Income statement.

Provisions
Provisions are made when all of the following criteria have been met: (i) an obligation exists for a present liability in respect of a past 
event; (ii) where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated; and (iii) where it is considered probable that an outflow of 
economic resources will be required to settle the obligation. Where it is not considered probable that there will be an outflow of 
economic resources required to settle the obligation, the Group does not recognise a provision, but discloses the matter as a 
contingent liability. The Group assesses whether each matter is probable of there being an outflow of economic resources to settle 
the obligation at each reporting date.

Employee leaving indemnities and other employee provisions are recorded for flight crew who, meeting certain conditions, have the 
option of being placed on reserve or of taking early retirement. The Group is obligated to remunerate these employees until they 
reach the statutory retirement age. The calculation is performed by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method.

Other employee related provisions are recognised for direct expenditures of business reorganisation such as severance payments 
(restructuring provisions) where plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate communication to those 
affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.

The method for determining legal claims provisions is determined on a claim by claim basis. Where a claim includes a significant 
population of items, the weighted average provision is estimated by determining all potential outcomes and the probability of their 
occurrence. Where a claim relates to a single item, then the Group determines the associated provision by applying the most likely 
outcome giving consideration to alternative outcomes. Where an individual claim is significant, the disclosure of quantitative 
information is restricted to the extent that it does not prejudice the outcome of the claim. If the effect is material, expected future 
cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the provision. Where discounting is used, 
the effect of unwinding the discount rate is recognised as a Finance cost in the Income statement.

Revenue recognition

Passenger revenue
The Group’s revenue primarily derives from transportation services for both passengers and cargo. Revenue is recognised when the 
transportation service has been provided. 

Passenger tickets are generally paid for in advance of transportation and are recognised, net of discounts, as Deferred revenue and 
presented within current liabilities until either: (i) the customer has flown; or (ii) where the customer does not fly on the intended 
date and has purchased a non-flexible fare.

For flexible and semi-flexible tickets, when the customer does not travel on the intended date, a term referred to as ‘unused tickets’, 
the customer has a number of options they can elect to apply, depending on the fare type: (i) reschedule the date of intended travel; 
(ii) request a refund; or (iii) request a voucher.

The Group estimates the amount of these unused tickets for which customers are not expected to exercise their remaining rights 
prior to expiry based on the terms and conditions of the ticket and analysis of historical experience, a term referred to as ‘unused 
ticket breakage’. This revenue is recognised based on the terms and conditions of the ticket and analysis of historical experience. For 
unused ticket breakage, revenue is recognised only when the risk of a significant reversal of revenue is remote. The estimation 
regarding historical experience is updated at each reporting date.

Where a flight is cancelled, the customer has a number of options they can elect to apply to their unused tickets: (i) compensation; 
(ii) a refund; (iii) changing to an alternative flight; or (iv) the receipt of a voucher. 

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

227

Corporate GovernanceStrategic ReportFinancial Statements2 Significant accounting policies continued
The presentation in the financial statements of these customer options, to the extent they differ to the recognition criteria stated 
above, are as follows:

• Compensation for flight cancellation - such payments are presented net within Passenger revenue against the original ticket 

purchased;

• Refund - deferred revenue is reduced and no amount is recorded within revenue;
• Changing to an alternative flight – amounts are retained within Deferred revenue until such time as the flight is flown, at which 

time it is recorded within Passenger revenue; and

• Voucher - retained within Deferred revenue until such time as it is redeemed for a flight or it expires, at which time it is recorded 

within Passenger revenue. 

In relation to vouchers, the Group also recognises revenue by estimating the amount of vouchers that customers are not expected to 
exercise their remaining rights prior to expiry using analysis of historical experience. The estimation regarding historical experience is 
updated at each reporting date. The amount of such revenue recognised is constrained, where necessary, such that the risk of a 
significant reversal of revenue in the future is remote. 

Payments received in relation to certain ancillary services regarding passenger transportation, such as change fees, are not 
considered to be distinct from the performance obligation to provide the passenger flight. Payments relating to these ancillary 
services are recognised in Deferred revenue in current liabilities until the customer has flown.

The Group considers whether it is an agent or a principal in relation to passenger transportation services by considering whether it 
has a performance obligation to provide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for the services to be 
provided by a third party. The Group acts as an agent where: (i) it collects various taxes, duties and fees assessed on the sale of 
tickets to passengers and remits these to the relevant taxing authorities; and (ii) where it provides interline services to airline 
partners outside of the Group. Commissions earned in relation to agency services are recognised as revenue when the underlying 
goods or services have been transferred to the customer. In all other instances, the Group considers it acts as the principal in relation 
to passenger transportation services.

Cargo revenue 
The Group has identified a single performance obligation in relation to cargo services and the associated revenue is measured at its 
standalone selling price and recognised on satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs on the fulfilment of the 
transportation service.

Other revenue
The Group has identified several performance obligations in relation to services that give rise to revenue being recognised within 
Other revenue. These services, their performance obligations and associated revenue recognition include: 

• the provision of maintenance services and overhaul services for engines and airframes, where the Group is engaged to enhance an 

asset while the customer retains control of the asset. Accordingly, the performance obligations are satisfied, and revenue 
recognised, over time. The Group estimates the proportion of the contract completed at the reporting date and recognises 
revenue based on the percentage of completion of the contract; 

• the provision of ground handling services, where the performance obligations are fulfilled when the services are provided;
• the provision of holiday and hotel services, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer receives the 

benefit of the service; and

• brand and marketing activities, where the performance obligations are satisfied as the associated activities occur.

Customer loyalty programmes
The Group operates four principal loyalty programmes: the British Airways Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Vueling Club and the Aer 
Lingus Aer Club. The customer loyalty programmes award travellers Avios to redeem for various rewards, primarily redemption 
travel, including flights, hotels and car hire. Avios are also sold to commercial partners to use in loyalty activity.

Avios issuance
When issued, the standalone selling price of an Avios is recorded within Deferred revenue in current liabilities until the customer 
redeems the Avios. The standalone selling price of Avios is based on the value of the awards for which the points could be 
redeemed. The Group also recognises revenue associated with the proportion of Avios which are not expected to be redeemed, 
referred to as ‘breakage’, based on the results of modelling using historical experiences and expected future trends in customer 
behaviour, up until the reporting date. The amount of such revenue recognised is limited, where necessary, such that the risk of a 
significant reversal of revenue in the future is remote.

Where the issuance of Avios arises from travel on the Group’s airlines, the consideration received from the customer may differ to 
the aggregation of the relative standalone selling prices. In such instances the allocation of the consideration to each performance 
obligation is undertaken on a proportional basis using the relative standalone selling prices.

The Group has contractual arrangements with non-Group airlines and non-air partners for the issuance and redemption of Avios, for 
which it has identified the following performance obligations:

Companion vouchers
Certain non-air partners issue their card holders with companion vouchers, which forms part of the variable consideration of the 
overall contract, depending on the level of expenditure by the card holders, for redemption on the airlines of the Group for the same 
flight and class of cabin as the underlying fare being purchased. The Group estimates the standalone selling price of the companion 
voucher performance obligation, using valuation techniques, by reference to the amount that a third party would be prepared to pay 
in an arm’s length transaction.

228

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Notes to the accounts continuedBrand and marketing activities
For both air and non-air partners, the Group licenses the Avios and the airline brands for certain activities, such as the creation of co-
branded credit cards. In addition, the Group has certain contractual arrangements whereby it commits to provide marketing services 
to the members of the loyalty schemes on behalf of those partners. For the provision of both brand and marketing services, the 
partner receives benefits incremental to the issuance of Avios. The Group estimates the standalone selling price of the brand and 
marketing performance obligations, using valuation techniques, by reference to the amount that a third party would be prepared to 
pay in an arm’s length transaction for access to comparable brands for the period over which they use the brand. For brand services, 
as the Group considers that the partner has the right to use the brand, revenue is recognised as the brand service is provided and 
not over time. For marketing performance obligations, revenue is recognised as the marketing activities occur based on when the 
partner receives the benefit of those services.

Upfront payments
Where a partner makes an upfront payment to the Group which does not relate to any specific performance obligation, then the 
Group considers such payments as advance payments for future goods and services and the associated revenue is recognised as 
those goods and services are provided, as detailed above. In such instances the payment is allocated across all of the performance 
obligations over the contract term. The Group estimates the expected level of Avios to be issued over the contract term using 
experience, historical and expected future trends, and allocates the payments to the relevant performance obligations accordingly. 
At each reporting date, the Group updates its estimate of the number of Avios expected to be issued over the total contract term 
and recognises a cumulative catch-up adjustment where necessary.

When a partner makes an upfront payment to the Group, the Group assesses whether such a payment is representative of a 
significant financing event. Where a significant financing component is identified, the Group estimates a market rate of interest that 
an arm’s length financial liability of similar size and tenor would yield. The Group recognises the imputed interest within the 
Income statement as Other finance costs within Finance costs.

Other considerations
The Group considers whether it is an agent or a principal in relation to the loyalty services by considering whether it has a 
performance obligation to provide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for the services to be provided 
by a third party. In particular, the Group acts as an agent where customers redeem their Avios on interline partner flights outside of 
the Group, where the fees payable to the interline partner are presented net against the associated release of the Deferred revenue.

Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those that in management’s view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or nature and where 
such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the Group’s financial performance. While management has defined a list of 
items and a quantitative threshold that would merit categorisation as exceptional that has been established through historical 
experience, the Group retains the flexibility to add additional items should their size or nature merit such presentation. The 
accounting policy in respect of exceptional items and classification of an item as exceptional is approved by the Board, through the 
Audit and Compliance Committee.

The financial performance of the Group is monitored by the Management Committee and the Board on a pre-exceptional basis to 
enable comparison to prior reporting periods as well as to other selected companies, and also for making strategic, financial and 
operational decisions. 

The exceptional items recorded in the Income statement include, but are not limited to, items such as significant settlement 
agreements with the Group’s pension schemes; significant restructuring; the impact of business combination transactions that do not 
contribute to the ongoing results of the Group; significant discontinuance of hedge accounting; legal settlements; individually 
significant tax transactions; and the impact of the sale, disposal or impairment of an asset or investment in a business. Where 
exceptional items are separately disclosed, the resultant tax impact is additionally separately disclosed. Certain exceptional items 
may cover more than a single reporting period, such as significant restructuring events, but not more than two reporting periods.

Further information is given in the Alternative performance measures section.

Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. Loans provided and/or 
guaranteed by governments that represent market rates of interest are recorded at the amount of the proceeds received and 
recognised within Borrowings. Those loans provided and/or guaranteed by governments that represent below market rates of 
interest are measured at inception at their fair value and recognised within Borrowings, with the differential to the proceeds received 
recorded within Deferred income and released to the relevant financial statement caption in the Income statement on a systematic 
basis. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the Income statement in the relevant financial 
statement caption on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised.

Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. These judgements, estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Actual results in the future may differ from judgements and estimates upon which financial information has 
been prepared. These underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised prospectively.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

229

Corporate GovernanceStrategic ReportFinancial Statements2 Significant accounting policies continued

Estimates
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:

a Employee benefit obligations, employee leaving indemnities, other employee related restructuring

At 31 December 2023 the Group recognised €1,380 million in respect of employee benefit assets (2022: €2,334 million) and €175 
million in respect of employee benefit obligations (2022: €217 million). Further information on employee benefit obligations is 
disclosed in note 34.

The cost of employee benefit obligations, employee leaving indemnities and other employee-related provisions is determined using 
the valuation requirements of IAS 19. These valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these schemes, such assumptions are subject to 
significant uncertainty. The assumptions relating to these schemes are disclosed in note 34. The Group determines the assumptions 
to be adopted in discussion with qualified actuaries. Any difference between these assumptions and the actual outcome will impact 
future net assets and total comprehensive income. The sensitivity to changes in pension assumptions is disclosed in note 34.

Under the Group’s Airways Pension Scheme (APS) and New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS) defined benefit schemes, increases to 
pensions are based on the annual Government Pension Increase (Review) Orders, which since 2011 have been based on the 
Consumer Prices Index (CPI). Additionally, in APS there is provision for the Trustee to pay increases up to the level of the Retail 
Prices Index (RPI), subject to certain affordability tests. Historically market expectations for RPI could be derived by comparing the 
prices of UK Government fixed-interest and index-linked gilts, with CPI assessed by considering the Bank of England’s inflation 
target and comparison of the construction of the two inflation indices. 

In November 2020, the UK Government and UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) confirmed alignment of RPI with CPIH (a variant of CPI) 
from February 2030. In assessing RPI and CPI inflation from investment market data, allowance has been made for alignment of RPI 
with CPIH from 2030 and, therefore, effectively no gap between RPI and CPI inflation from that date. CPI inflation before 2030 is 
assumed to be 1 per cent per annum below RPI inflation.

b Revenue recognition

At 31 December 2023 the Group recognised €8,023 million (2022: €7,644 million) in respect of deferred revenue of which €2,712 
million (2022: €2,630 million) related to customer loyalty programmes. Further information on deferred revenue is included in note 
24.

Passenger revenue
Passenger revenue is recognised when the transportation service is provided. At the time of intended transportation, revenue is also 
recognised in respect of estimated unused tickets breakage and is estimated based on the terms and conditions of the tickets and 
historical experience. The Group considers that there is no reasonably possible change to unused ticket assumptions that would 
have a material impact on passenger revenue recorded in the year. A 2 percentage point increase in the level of unused ticket 
breakage of the sales in advance of carriage balance (excluding vouchers) at 31 December 2023 would result in an adjustment to 
Deferred revenue of €93 million, with an offsetting adjustment to increase revenue and operating profit recognised in the year.

For details regarding the voucher liability at 31 December 2023 and the associated sensitivity, see note 24.

Customer loyalty schemes
Revenue associated with the issuance of Avios under customer loyalty programmes is based on the relative standalone selling prices 
of the related performance obligations (brand, marketing and Avios), determined using estimation techniques. The transaction price 
of brand and marketing services is determined using specific brand valuation methodologies. The transaction price of an Avios is 
determined as the price of the rewards against which they can be redeemed and is reduced to take account of the proportion of 
Avios that are not expected to be redeemed by customers.

During 2022, 2021 and 2020, due to the significant restrictions imposed on the ability of customers to redeem Avios, as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the disruption in the patterns of redemption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group 
considered that the trends experienced since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were not reflective of the long-term expected 
patterns of redemption and accordingly, the Group was unable to determine with a high degree of probability that there would not 
be a significant reversal of revenue in the future had it applied the redemption trends that were experienced over the period of the 
pandemic. Accordingly, for the years to 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the Group estimated the level 
of redemption activity based on pre-COVID-19 pandemic customer behaviour. 

During 2023, the Group considers historical redemption activity, including customers’ more recent behaviours following the 
COVID-19 pandemic, representative of long-term behavioural trends, such that the Group considers that the risk of a significant 
reversal of revenue to be sufficiently low. Accordingly, the Group has updated its estimated level of redemption activity to 
incorporate current customer behaviour.

The Group estimates the number of Avios not expected to be redeemed using statistical modelling based on historical experience 
and expected future trends in customer behaviour. A 5 percentage point increase in the assumption of Avios not expected to be 
redeemed would result in an adjustment to Deferred revenue of €94 million, with an offsetting adjustment to increase revenue and 
operating profit recognised in the year.

Notes to the accounts continuedUnredeemed vouchers liability
Historically, where a voucher has been issued to a customer in the event of a flight cancellation, the Group estimated, based on 
historical experience, the level of such vouchers not expected to be used prior to expiry and recognised revenue accordingly. During 
2020 and 2021, due to the significant level of flight cancellations arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group issued a greater 
volume of vouchers than it would have otherwise done. In addition, given the uncertainty as to the timing of customers redeeming 
these vouchers, the Group was unable to estimate with a high degree of probability that there would not be a significant reversal of 
revenue in the future had it applied the historical expiry trends over the period of the pandemic. Accordingly, for the years to 31 
December 2022, 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the Group did not recognise revenue arising from those vouchers issued 
due to COVID-19 pandemic-related cancellations until either the voucher was redeemed or it expired.

During 2023, the Group considers historical redemption activity, including customers’ more recent behaviours following the 
COVID-19 pandemic, representative of the redemption trends expected through to expiry of the vouchers, such that the Group 
considers that the risk of a significant reversal of revenue to be sufficiently low. Accordingly, the Group has updated its estimated 
level of redemption activity to incorporate current customer behaviour.

c Income taxes

At 31 December 2023, the Group recognised €1,202 million in respect of deferred tax assets (2022: €1,282 million). Further 
information on current and deferred tax is disclosed in note 10.

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Estimates are required in determining the worldwide provision for 
income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it may be 
unclear how tax law applies to a particular transaction or circumstance. Where the Group determines that it is more likely than not 
that the tax authorities would accept the position taken in the tax return, amounts are recognised in the financial statements on that 
basis. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, the Group recognises a liability based on either: the Group’s 
judgement of the most likely outcome; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability-weighted average 
approach.

The Group recognises deferred tax assets only to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Management uses judgement, 
including the consideration of past and current operating performance and the future projections of performance laid out in the 
approved business plan in order to assess the probability of recoverability. 

In exercising this judgement, while there are no time restrictions on the utilisation of historic tax losses in the principal jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates, future cash flow projections are forecast for a period of up to ten years from the balance sheet date, 
which represents the period over which it is probable that future taxable profits will be available.

At 31 December 2023, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets of €1,584 million relating to tax losses and other temporary 
differences the Group does not reasonably expect to utilise. In applying the aforementioned judgement, had the Group extended the 
period of future cash flow projections indefinitely, then the amount of unrecognised tax losses would have reduced by €575 million. 
Conversely, if the forecast profit before tax for each operating company was reduced by 2 percentage points over the forecast 
period, the amount of the unrecognised tax losses would increase by €12 million.

d Impairment of non-financial assets

At 31 December 2023 the Group recognised €2,428 million (2022: €2,423 million) in respect of intangible assets with an indefinite 
life, including goodwill. Further information on these assets is included in note 17.

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite economic lives are tested, as part of the cash-generating units to which they relate, for 
impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been 
determined based on value-in-use calculations, which use a weighted average multi-scenario discounted cash flow model, which are 
then compared to the carrying amount of the associated cash-generating unit.

In determining the carrying value of each cash generating unit (CGU), the Group allocates all associated operating tangible and 
intangible assets, including ROU assets. In addition, the Group has allocated certain liabilities to the carrying value of each CGU 
where those liabilities are critical to the underlying operations of the cash-generating unit and in the event of a disposal of the cash-
generating unit would be required to be transferred to the purchaser. Such liabilities include lease liabilities.

The Group has applied judgement in the weighting of each scenario in the discounted cash flow model and these calculations require 
the use of estimates in the determination of key assumptions and sensitivities as disclosed in notes 4 and 17.

The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. When such 
indicators are identified, then non-financial assets are tested for impairment.

Corporate GovernanceStrategic ReportFinancial Statements2 Significant accounting policies continued

e Engineering and other aircraft costs

At 31 December 2023 the Group recognised €2,529 million in respect of maintenance, restoration and handback provisions, 
principally in respect of leased aircraft (2022: €2,400 million). Information on movements on the provision is disclosed in note 27.

IFRS 16 does not address the accounting for maintenance, restoration and handback provisions that arise through the usage of the 
underlying asset and accordingly, the Group has applied judgement in applying an accounting policy with regard to the recognition 
and subsequent measurement of such provisions for leased aircraft. The Group’s accounting policy for provisions that arise through 
usage or through the passage of time, is to recognise the associated estimated costs in the Income statement as the underlying 
asset is used or through the passage of time. The approach applied by the Group is consistent with the majority of major airlines that 
prepare their financial statements under IFRS. Were the Group to apply an alternative accounting policy, the financial impact would 
be materially different at the reporting date. An alternative accounting policy that the Group could have applied was the 
components approach, where the Group would capitalise the estimated costs of major maintenance events and depreciating them 
until the subsequent maintenance event (or to the end of lease term) and providing over the lease term for any expected cash 
compensation for maintenance obligations at the end of the lease. The Group considers that the current accounting policy for 
maintenance, restoration and handback activities reflects the obligations under its lease arrangements.

The Group has a number of contracts with service providers to replace or repair engine parts and for other maintenance checks. 
These agreements are complex and generally cover a number of years. Provisions for maintenance, restoration and handback are 
made based on the best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow. In determining this best estimate, the Group applies 
significant judgement as to the level of forecast costs expected to be incurred when the major maintenance event occurs. Other 
assumptions not considered to be significant include aircraft utilisation, expected maintenance intervals and the aircraft’s condition. 
The associated forecast costs are discounted to their present value. While the Group considers that there are no reasonably possible 
change to any of the individual assumptions that would have a material impact on the provisions, a combination of changes in 
several assumptions may. The Group considers that a reasonably possible change in the inflation rate and discount rate assumptions 
of a 100 basis points increase would give rise to an increase of €53 million (2022: €51 million) and a decrease of €59 million (2022: 
€68 million), respectively, when applied in isolation to one another.

Judgements

a Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options

The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to 
extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is 
reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to 
exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. Such judgement includes consideration of fleet plans which underpin approved 
business plans and historical experience regarding the extension of leases. After the commencement date, the Group re-assesses the 
lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that affects the Group’s ability to exercise or not to exercise the 
option to renew or to terminate. Further information is given in note 14.

b Determining whether the Group has significant influence over Air Europa Holdings

The Group applies judgement in the determination as to whether it has the power with which to participate in the decision-making 
of, and as a result significant influence over, Air Europa Holdings, S.L. (Air Europa Holdings). Such judgement includes the 
consideration as to the ability of the Group to: have representation on the board of Air Europa Holdings; participate in the policy-
making processes, including participation in decisions regarding dividends and other distributions; the existence of material 
transactions between Air Europa Holdings and the Group; and enable the interchange of management personnel and provide 
essential technical information.

In forming its judgement, the Group notes that: it does not have the ability to have representation on the board of Air Europa 
Holdings; it does not have the ability to participate in the policy-making processes; has not entered into material transactions outside 
of the normal course of business, with those transactions arising in the normal course of business being immaterial in nature; it does 
not have the ability to enable the interchange of management personnel; and it does not have the ability to provide essential 
technical information. The Group has therefore concluded that it does not have significant influence over Air Europa Holdings.

Accordingly, the Group accounts for its shareholding in Air Europa Holdings as an Other equity investment and measures it at fair 
value through Other comprehensive income. Had the Group concluded that it does have significant influence over Air Europa 
Holdings, then the shareholding would have been classified as an associate, measured at cost on inception and subsequently 
measured using the equity method.

At 31 December 2023, the fair value of its shareholding in Air Europa Holdings was €129 million. Further information is given in note 19.

c Determining whether the HMRC enquiries into the IAG Loyalty VAT accounting gives rise to a provision or a contingent liability

The Group applies judgement in the determination as to whether it considers the outcome of the enquiries between IAG Loyalty and 
His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), in the UK, on the IAG Loyalty VAT accounting, is more probable than not to result in an 
adverse outcome to the Group, and accordingly whether to record the matter as a provision or as a contingent liability.

In forming its judgement, the Group, with its legal and tax advisors, have reviewed the emerging view issued by HMRC, as well has 
having considered the historic tax ruling issued by HMRC to the Group on this matter. As a result, the Group does not consider it 
probable that an adverse outcome will eventuate and accordingly no provision has been recorded at 31 December 2023 and the 
matter has been disclosed as a contingent liability.

Had the Group, with its legal and tax advisors, considered that it was more probable than not that an adverse outcome would 
eventuate, then the Group would have recognised a provision for the best estimate of the potential outflow of economic benefit to 
the Group, with a corresponding charge recorded within the Income statement. Further information is given in note 10g.

Notes to the accounts continuedNew standards, amendments and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2023, but do not have a material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group:

• IFRS 17 Insurance contracts – effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023;
• definition of accounting estimate – amendments to IAS 8 effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023;
• disclosure of accounting policies – amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice statement 2 effective for periods beginning on or after 1 

January 2023;

• deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction – amendments to IAS 12 effective for periods 

beginning on or after 1 January 2023; and

• international tax reform: Pillar Two model reforms – amendments to IAS 12 effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 

2023.

The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards, amendments and interpretations with an effective date after the year end 
of these financial statements which management believe could impact the Group in future periods. The Group has assessed the 
impact of these standards, amendments and interpretations and it is not expected that these will have a material effect on the 
reported income or net assets of the Group unless otherwise stated. The Group plans to adopt the following standards, 
interpretations and amendments on the date they become mandatory:

• disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements – amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 effective for periods beginning on or after 1 

January 2024;

• lease liability in a sale and leaseback – amendments to IFRS 16 effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024; and
• on 31 October 2022, the IASB issued the amendments to IAS 1 – classification of liabilities as current or non-current (the 

‘Amendments’), effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The Amendments will require the €825 million 
convertible bond that matures in 2028, which as at 31 December 2023, had a carrying value of €735 million, to be reclassified from 
a non-current liability to a current liability with the comparative presentation as at 31 December 2022 also reclassified. The 
Amendments require that where the conversion feature of a convertible instrument does not meet the recognition criteria for 
separate presentation within equity and where the associated bond holders have the irrevocable right to exercise the conversion 
feature within 12 months of the balance sheet date, that such convertible instruments be presented as current. Other than this 
reclassification, the Amendments will not have a material effect on the reported results or net assets of the Group.

3 Significant changes and transactions in the current reporting period

The financial performance and position of the Group was affected by the following significant events and transactions in the year to 
31 December 2023 as detailed below:

• on 23 February 2023, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 80 per cent of the share capital of Air Europa 

Holdings that it had not previously owned. On successful completion of the transaction, 54,064,575 ordinary shares of the 
Company (which represented €100 million at the date of the agreement) will be transferred to and €100 million in cash will be paid 
to Globalia, with a further €100 million paid on both the first and second anniversary of completion. 

In addition, the Group has agreed to pay a break-fee to Globalia of €50 million should: (i) the relevant approvals, detailed below, 
not be forthcoming within 24 months of entering into the agreement; or (ii) the Group terminates the agreement at any time prior 
to completion. Under the agreement, this 24-month period can be extended, by mutual consent. The acquisition is conditional on 
Globalia receiving approval from the syndicated banks that provide the loan agreements that are partially guaranteed by the 
Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) and Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) in Spain. The acquisition is also subject 
to approval by relevant competition authorities. Until the completion of these approvals, the acquisition does not meet the 
recognition criteria under IFRS 3 Business combinations, and no accounting has been made for the transaction in these 
consolidated financial statements;

• on 4 March 2023, Aer Lingus repaid in full the €50 million of the financial arrangement with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund 

(ISIF). At 31 December 2023, €350 million of undrawn facilities remain available for draw down;

• in May 2023, the Group announced its intention to carry out a share purchase programme in order to acquire approximately 50 

per cent of the aforementioned ordinary shares required as part of the acquisition of Air Europa Holdings. The programme 
completed during the year to 31 December 2023, with the Group having purchased 27 million treasury shares amounting to €49 
million;

• on 30 June 2023, the Group converted 10 Airbus A320neo options into firm orders. The aircraft will be delivered in 2028 and will 

be used by any of the Group's airlines to replace A320ceo family aircraft;

• on 4 July 2023, the Group redeemed upon maturity the senior unsecured €500 million fixed rate bond; 
• on 27 July 2023, the Group announced that it had converted six Boeing 787-10 options held by British Airways into firm orders and 

at the same time is adding a further six 787-10 options to its long-haul order book. The Group also converted one Airbus 
A350-900 option held by Iberia into a firm order. These aircraft will be delivered in 2025 and 2026 and will be used by British 
Airways and Iberia to restore capacity in the airlines’ long-haul fleets; 

• on 23 August 2023, the Group extended the terms of $1.655 billion of the $1.755 billion Revolving Credit Facility available to British 

Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus by an additional 12 months through to March 2026 with the remaining $100 million available 
through to March 2025. At 31 December 2023, the Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn;

• on 28 September 2023, British Airways repaid its syndicated loan of £2.0 billion (€2.3 billion), which was partially guaranteed by 
the UK Export Finance (UKEF). At the same time, British Airways entered into a new five-year Export Development Guarantee 
Facility of £1.0 billion (€1.2 billion), with commitments from a syndicate of banks, partially guaranteed by the UKEF, and available 
through to September 2028. The new facility is in addition to the £1.0 billion Export Development Guarantee Facility, which was 
entered into in 2021 and which is available through to November 2026. Both facilities were undrawn at 31 December 2023; 

• on 31 October 2023 Iberia repaid the remaining outstanding €644 million of the €750 million floating rate syndicated financing 

agreement, partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) in Spain;

• on 15 November 2023, Iberia early repaid other loans and borrowings of €42 million; and
• on 30 November 2023, Vueling repaid the remaining outstanding €223 million of the €260 million floating rate syndicated 

financing agreement, partially guaranteed by ICO.

Corporate GovernanceStrategic ReportFinancial Statements4 Impact of climate change on financial reporting

Significant transactions and critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements in the determination of the impact of 
climate change
As a result of climate change the Group has designed and approved its Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy, which commits the 
Group to net zero emissions by 2050. While approved business plans currently have a duration of three years, the Flightpath Net 
Zero climate strategy impacts both the short-, medium- and long-term operations of the Group.

The details regarding the inputs and assumptions used in the determination of the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy include, but 
are not limited to, the following that are within the control of the Group:

• the additional cost of the Group’s commitment to increasing the level of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to 10 per cent by 2030 

and to 70 per cent by 2050;

• the cost of incurring an increase in the level of carbon offsetting and carbon capture schemes; and
• the impact of introducing more fuel-efficient aircraft and being able to operate these more efficiently.

In addition to these inputs and measures within the control of management, Flightpath Net Zero includes assumptions pertaining to 
consumers, governments and regulators regarding the following:

• the impact on passenger demand for air travel as a result of both passenger trends regarding climate change and government 

policies;

• investment and policy regarding the development of SAF production facilities;
• investment and improvements in air traffic management; and
• the price of carbon through the EU, Swiss and UK Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) and the UN Carbon Offsetting and Reduction 

Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The level of uncertainty regarding the impact of these factors increases over time. Accordingly, the Group has applied critical 
estimation and judgement in the evaluation of the impact of climate change regarding the recognition and measurement of assets 
and liabilities within the financial statements.

Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements – cash flow forecast estimation
With the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy assessing the impact over a long-term horizon to 2050, the level of estimation 
uncertainty in the determination of cash flow forecasts increases over time. For those assets and liabilities, where their recoverability 
is dependent on long-term cash flows, the following critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements, to the extent they 
can be reliably measured, have been applied:

a Long-term fleet plans and useful economic lives

The Group’s Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy has been developed in conjunction with the long-term fleet plans of each 
operating company. This includes the annual assessment of useful lives and the residual values of each aircraft type.

As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group retired 72 aircraft, their associated engines and rotable inventories. 
These retired aircraft were older generation aircraft, that were less fuel-efficient, more carbon-intensive and more expensive to 
operate than more modern models.

Subsequent to the retirement of these aircraft, coupled with the future committed delivery of 178 fuel-efficient aircraft as detailed in 
note 15, the Group considers the existing fleet assets align with the long-term fleet plans to achieve its Flightpath Net Zero climate 
strategy. All aircraft in the fleet, and those due to be delivered in the future, have the capability to utilise SAF in their operations 
without impediment. Accordingly, no impairment has arisen in the current or prior year, nor have the useful lives and residual values 
of aircraft been amended, as a result of the Group’s decarbonisation plans.

b Impairment testing of the Group’s cash generating units

The Group applies discounted cash flow models, for each cash generating unit, derived from the cash flow forecasts from the 
approved three-year business plans. The Group’s Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy is long term in nature and includes 
commitments that will occur at differing points over this time horizon. To the extent that certain of those commitments occur over 
the short term, then they have been incorporated into the three-year business plans.

The Group adjusts the final year (being the third year) of these probability-weighted cash flows to incorporate the impacts of 
climate change from the Group’s Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy that are expected to occur over the medium term, being to 
2030. These adjustments are limited to those that: (i) the Group can reliably estimate at the reporting date, with those costs 
subsequent to 2030 having such a high degree of uncertainty that they cannot be reliably estimated; (ii) only relate to the Group’s 
existing asset base in its current condition; and (iii) incorporate legislation and regulation that is expected to be required to achieve 
the Group’s Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy, and which is sufficiently progressed at the reporting date.

As a result, the Group’s impairment modelling incorporates the following aspects of the Group’s Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy 
through to 2030, after which time the level of uncertainty regarding timing and costing becomes insufficiently reliable to estimate: 
(i) an increase in the level of SAF consumption to 10 per cent of the overall fuel mix; (ii) forecast cost of carbon, including SAF, ETS 
allowances and CORSIA allowances (all derived from externally sourced or derived information); (iii) the removal of existing free ETS 
allowances issued by the EU member states, Switzerland and the UK; (iv) forecast kerosene taxes applied to jet fuel for all intra EU 
flight activity; and (v) assumptions regarding the ability of the Group to recover these incremental costs through increased ticket 
pricing.

234

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Notes to the accounts continuedIn preparing the impairment models, the Group cash flow projections are prepared on the basis of using the current fleet in its 
current condition. The Group excludes the estimated cash flows expected to arise from future restructuring unless already 
committed and assets not currently in use by the Group. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the Group’s impairment modelling 
excludes the following aspects of the Group’s Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy: (i) the expected transition to electric and 
hydrogen aircraft, as well as future technological developments to jet engines and airframes; (ii) any savings from the transition to 
more fuel-efficient aircraft other than those either in the Group’s fleet or those committed orders due to be delivered over the 
business plan period; (iii) the benefit of the development of carbon capture technologies and enhanced carbon offsetting 
mechanisms; (iv) the required beneficial reforms to air traffic management regulation and legislation; and (v) the required 
government incentives and/or support across the supply chain.

As detailed in note 17, the Group applies a long-term growth rate to these adjusted probability weighted cash flows, per CGU, and 
each of the long-term growth rates include a specific adjustment to reduce the rate to reflect the Group’s assumptions regarding the 
reduced demand and elasticity impact arising from climate change. These impacts are derived with reference to external market 
data, industry publications and internal analysis.

Given the inherent uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change, the Group has applied additional sensitivities in note 17 
to reflect a more adverse impact of climate change than currently expected. This has been captured through both the downward 
sensitivities of the long-term growth rates, ASKs and operating margins and the increased fuel price sensitivity.

c Valuation of employee benefit scheme assets

The Group’s employee benefit schemes are principally represented by the British Airways APS and NAPS schemes in the UK. The 
schemes are structured to make post-employment payments to members over the long term, with the Trustee having established 
both return-seeking assets and liability-matching assets that mature over the long term to align with the forecast benefit payments.

The assets of these schemes are invested predominantly in a diversified range of equities, bonds and property. The valuation of 
these assets ranges from those with quoted prices in active markets, where prices are readily and regularly available, through to 
those where the valuations are not based on observable market data, often requiring complex valuation models. The trustees of the 
schemes have integrated climate change considerations into their long-term decision-making and reporting processes across all 
classes of assets, actively engaging with all fund and portfolio managers to ensure that where unobservable inputs are required into 
valuation models, that such valuation models incorporate long-term expectations regarding the impact of climate change.

d Recoverability of deferred tax assets

In determining the recoverable amounts of the Group’s deferred tax assets, the Group applies the future cash flow projections for a 
period of up to ten years derived from the approved three-year business plans. The Group applies a medium-term growth rate 
subsequent to the three-year business plans, specific to each operating company. In considering the impact of the Group’s 
Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy, management adjusts this medium-term growth rate, where applicable, to incorporate the 
assumed impacts on both revenue and costs to the Group.

e The price of carbon through the EU, Swiss and UK Emissions Trading Schemes

The EU, Swiss and the UK’s ETS were established to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost effectively. Under these schemes, 
companies, including the Group’s companies, are required to buy emission allowances, or are issued them under existing quotas. The 
Group is required to surrender these allowances to the relevant authorities annually dependent on the level of CO2 equivalent 
emitted within a 12-month period. Over time, the level of available emission allowances decreases in order to reduce total emissions, 
which has the effect of increasing the price of such allowances. The Group expects that the future price of such allowances will 
continue to increase and that the free allocation of emission allowances will cease. Given the relative illiquid nature of the emission 
allowance market there is uncertainty as to the future pricing of such allowances.

As detailed in note 2, the Group accounts for the purchase of allowances as an addition to Intangible assets, which are measured at 
amortised cost. In addition, as the Group emits CO2 equivalent as part of its flight operations, a provision is recorded to settle the 
obligation. As the provision is recognised, a corresponding amount is recorded in the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and 
emission charges. For emissions for which the Group has already purchased allowances, the provision is valued at the weighted cost 
of those allowances. Where the level of emissions exceeds the amounts of allowances held, this deficit is measured at the market 
price of such allowances at the reporting date.

For the year to, and as at, 31 December 2023, the Group has recorded the following within the financial statements:

• additions to the ETS allowance provision and accordingly an expense within Fuel, oil costs and emission charges, of €238 million 

(see note 27);

• purchases of ETS allowances recorded as additions to intangible assets of €264 million (see note 17);
• total ETS allowances at the reporting date recorded within intangible assets of €577 million (see note 17); and
• commitments for forward purchase agreements for ETS allowances of €216 million (see note 15).

At 31 December 2023, the Group has acquired and committed to acquire at fixed prices, the following percentages of its total 
emissions allowances forecast to be purchased over the business plan period to 31 December 2026:

Corporate GovernanceStrategic ReportFinancial Statements5 Segment information

a Business segments

The chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, 
and has been identified as the IAG Management Committee (IAG MC).

The Group has a number of entities which are managed as individual operating companies including airline, loyalty and platform 
functions. Each operating company operates its network operations as a single business unit and the IAG MC assesses performance 
based on measures including operating profit, and makes resource allocation decisions for the operating companies based on 
profitability, primarily by reference to the passenger markets in which the companies operate. The objective in making resource 
allocation decisions is to optimise consolidated financial results.

The Group has determined its operating segments based on the way that it treats its businesses and the manner in which resource 
allocation decisions are made. British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and IAG Loyalty have been identified for financial reporting 
purposes as reportable operating segments. LEVEL is also an operating segment but does not exceed the quantitative thresholds to 
be reportable and management has concluded that there are currently no other reasons why LEVEL should be separately disclosed.

There are varying levels of transactions between operating segments, which principally relate to the provision of maintenance 
services from the Iberia operating segment to the other operating segments, the provision of flight services by the airlines to the IAG 
Loyalty segment and the provision of loyalty services from IAG Loyalty to the airline operating segments.

The platform functions of the business primarily support the airline and loyalty operations. These activities are not considered to be 
reportable operating segments as they either earn revenues incidental to the activities of the Group and resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the passenger business or are not reviewed regularly by the IAG MC and are included within Other 
Group companies.

The deferred tax assets mainly arise in Spain and the UK and are expected to reverse in full beyond one year. Recognition of the 
deferred tax assets is supported by the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities in corresponding periods, and projections of 
operating performance laid out in the management approved business plans.

d Reconciliation of the total tax charge in the Income statement

The tax (charge)/credit is calculated at the domestic rates applicable to proﬁts/(losses) in the country in which the profits/(losses) 
arise. The differences between the expected tax charge (2022: charge) and the actual tax charge (2022: credit) on the profit for the 
year to 31 December 2023 (2022: profit) are explained below:

€ million

Unrecognised losses and deductible temporary differences arising in the year

Fair value movement on convertible bond

1 The expected tax charge is calculated by aggregating the expected tax (charges)/credits arising in each company in the Group and changes each 

year as tax rates and profit mix change. The 2023 corporate tax rates for the Group’s main countries of operation are Spain 25% (2022: 25%), the UK 
23.5% (2022: 19%) and Ireland 12.5% (2022: 12.5%).

None of the unrecognised temporary differences have an expiry date. Further information with regard to the sensitivity of the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets is given in note 2.

Revocation of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 in Spain
On 18 January 2024, the Tribunal Constitucional (Constitutional Court) in Spain issued a ruling that the amendments to corporate 
income tax introduced by Royal Decree Law 3/2016 were unconstitutional. Further details are given in note 38.

Unrecognised temporary differences – investment in subsidiaries and associates
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of €1,910 million (2022: €823 million) of temporary differences relating to 
subsidiaries and associates. The Group either controls the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax consequences would arise from their reversal to a material extent.

Tax rate changes
On 3 March 2021 the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that legislation would be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to set 
the main rate of corporation tax at 25 per cent from April 2023. On 24 May 2021 the Finance Bill was substantively enacted, which 
has led to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and will increase the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. As a 
result of the remeasurement of deferred tax balances in UK entities, a charge of €13 million (2022: €17 million credit) is recorded in 
the Income statement and a credit of €3 million (2022: €10 million charge) is recorded in Other comprehensive income.

Engagement with tax authorities
The Group is subject to audit and enquiry by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates, and engages with those tax 
authorities in a cooperative manner. 

During the course of 2023, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) in India has been enquiring into the quantum and 
nature of any services provided by the corporate head offices of a number of international airlines, including British Airways, to their 
Indian branches. As at 31 December 2023 and through to the date of these financial statements, the DGGI’s enquiries are ongoing.

Pillar Two minimum effective tax rate reform
In 2021 the OECD released the Two Pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. This 
reform to the international tax system addresses the geographical allocation of profits for the purposes of taxation, and is designed 
to ensure that multinational enterprises will be subject to a minimum 15 per cent effective tax rate.

On 15 December 2022, the Council of the European Union formally adopted the EU Pillar Two Directive. On 22 December 2022 the 
EU Minimum Tax Directive was published.

On 11 July 2023, the UK enacted Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 which introduced the Multinational Top-up Tax and the Domestic Top-up 
Tax with effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023. These taxes are the UK’s adoption of the income 
inclusion rule and domestic minimum top-up tax rule referenced in the OECD’s Pillar Two reform.

On 18 December 2023, Ireland enacted Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 which, pursuant to the EU Minimum Tax Directive, provided for the 
introduction of a new minimum effective rate of tax for certain businesses. These rules provide for a Qualified Domestic Top-Up Tax 
where an in-scope group’s Irish operations have an effective rate of tax of less than 15%. They come into force for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 31 December 2023.

10 Tax continued
On 19 December 2023, Spain’s Council of Ministers approved a draft law to implement the EU Minimum Tax Directive. This is to be 
subject to consultation, prior to being sent to Parliament. 

Under the legislation, the Group is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between the effective rate per jurisdiction and the 15 
per cent minimum rate. Such legislation applies prospectively for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023.

For 2023, the predominant jurisdiction in which the Group operates with an effective tax rate of less than 15 per cent is Ireland 
through Aer Lingus. While the impact of Pillar Two is not yet reasonably possible to estimate, for indicative purposes, in 2023 Aer 
Lingus recorded a current tax expense of €24 million relating to its Irish operations, representing an effective tax rate of 13 per cent. 
Had the effective tax rate applied by Aer Lingus to its Irish operations been 15 per cent, the current tax expense would have 
increased by €4 million to €28 million, which would not have had a significant impact on the overall Group effective tax rate of 13 per 
cent. 

On 23 May 2023, the IASB issued the amendments to IAS 12 – international tax reform: Pillar Two model reforms, effective for 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The amendments to IAS 12 provide temporary mandatory relief from the recognition of 
deferred tax balances arising from the implementation of the Pillar Two legislation. Accordingly, the Group has developed an 
accounting policy with regard to the recognition of deferred taxes arising from the Pillar Two model rules, where no adjustments to 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised that arise from the introduction of the minimum 15 per cent effective tax rate.

g Tax-related contingent liabilities

The Group has certain contingent liabilities that could be reliably estimated, across all taxes, but excluding the IAG Loyalty VAT 
matter detailed below, at 31 December 2023 amounting to €110 million (31 December 2022: €110 million). While the Group does not 
consider it more likely than not that there will be material losses on these matters, given the inherent uncertainty associated with tax 
litigation and tax audits, there can be no guarantee that material losses will not eventuate. As the Group considers that its chances of 
success in each of these matters is more probable than not, it is not appropriate to make a provision for these amounts. Included in 
the tax-related contingent liabilities are the following:

Merger gain
Following tax audits covering the period 2011 to 2014, the Spanish Tax Authorities issued a corporate income tax assessment to the 
Company regarding the merger in 2011 between British Airways and Iberia (the ‘Merger’). The maximum exposure in this case is €100 
million (31 December 2022: €98 million), being the amount in the tax assessment with an estimate of the interest accrued on that 
assessment through to 31 December 2023.

The Company appealed the assessment to the Tribunal Económico-Administrativo Central or ‘TEAC’ (Central Administrative Tax 
Tribunal). On 23 October 2019, the TEAC ruled in favour of the Spanish Tax Authorities. The Company subsequently appealed this 
ruling to the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court) on 20 December 2019, and on 24 July 2020 filed submissions in support of its 
case. To assist it in its deliberations as to whether a gain arose from the Merger, on 15 September 2023, the Audiencia Nacional 
commissioned an independent accounting expert to provide a report on the appropriate basis of accounting. As at 31 December 
2023 and through to the date of these financial statements, the Audiencia Nacional has not ruled on whether a gain arose from the 
Merger. The Company does not expect a hearing at the Audiencia Nacional on this case until mid to late 2024 at the earliest.

The Company disputes the technical merits of the assessment and ruling of the TEAC. Based on legal advice and an external 
accounting expert’s opinion, the Company believes that it has strong arguments to support its appeal. The Company does not 
consider it appropriate to make a provision for these amounts and accordingly has classified this matter as a contingent liability.

Should the Company be unsuccessful in its appeal to the Audiencia Nacional, it would re-assess its position and the associated 
accounting treatment accordingly.

Within the context of the aforementioned tax audits, the Spanish tax authorities concluded on the value of Iberia’s business within 
the Merger. This valuation was contested by the Company in a separate case, where no tax liability is due. The Company believes 
there are technical merits for a higher value, something that would indirectly reduce the quantum of the merger gain assessed in the 
dispute described above. On 18 January 2024, the Audiencia Nacional served notice on its judgment issued on 13 December 2023, 
whereby it ruled in favour of the Spanish tax authorities. The Company believes there are grounds to appeal the judgement to the 
Supreme Court in Spain. If an appeal on this matter was ultimately successful, it would reduce the exposure of the merger gain 
described above.

IAG Loyalty VAT
At 31 December 2023, and through to the date of this report, His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has issued protective 
notices of VAT assessments for the 24 months ended March 2020 to Avios Group (AGL) Limited, a controlled undertaking of the 
Group trading as IAG Loyalty. At the date of this report none of these protective notices of assessment are due for payment.

During the second quarter of 2023, and while its enquiries are ongoing at the date of this report, HMRC shared with the Group its 
emerging view on the appropriate VAT accounting, which differs to the current approach by IAG Loyalty. HMRC’s emerging view 
asserts that the charges made by IAG Loyalty are for participating/membership in the Avios scheme and the associated charges and 
are subject to VAT. IAG Loyalty accounts for VAT depending on the nature of the goods or services for which Avios are redeemed, 
the vast majority of which are flights, and zero-rated. IAG Loyalty’s VAT accounting has and continues to be based on a ruling issued 
by HMRC.

As at the date of this report, this emerging view did not consider the validity of the rulings HMRC has previously issued with regard 
to IAG Loyalty’s VAT accounting. Accordingly, and while having issued the protective notices, HMRC has not confirmed whether it 
considers its emerging view to be retroactive or only prospective in nature. The Group expects further developments in this matter 
during 2024, which may include HMRC issuing an update to its emerging view.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Notes to the accounts continuedWhile the Group has continued to engage with HMRC on the underlying facts, circumstances and technical analysis of the matter, as 
at the date of this report there remain a number of possible scenarios that could eventuate. The Group has reviewed HMRC’s 
emerging view with its legal and tax advisors and considers it has strong arguments to support its VAT accounting, including having 
received a ruling previously from HMRC on the matter, and therefore does not consider it probable that an adverse outcome will 
eventuate. Accordingly, the Group does not consider it appropriate to record any provision for this case at 31 December 2023. The 
Group, in conjunction with its advisors, considers the disclosure of a potential range of exposures, associated with the 
aforementioned possible scenarios that could eventuate, could prejudice seriously the position of the Group in its ongoing 
engagement with HMRC.

Should the Group and HMRC be unable to reach agreement on the appropriate VAT accounting, then the Group will have the ability 
to advance the case by initiating legal proceedings. To enable the Group to advance to initiate legal proceedings, it will need to pay, 
without admission of liability, to HMRC the total amount of assessments issued at the relevant time, which will be recoverable, in part 
or in full, should the Group be successful in the case. Until HMRC further progresses its enquiries, it is not possible to determine the 
payment required, if any, but any potential payment may result in a material cash outflow from the Group.

The assumed conversion of the €825 million convertible bond 2028 and outstanding employee share schemes have a dilutive impact 
on the earnings per share for the years to 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 due to the reported profit after tax for the 
respective years.

For information relating to Adjusted earnings per share refer to the Alternative performance measures section.

12 Dividends

The Directors propose that no dividend be paid for the year to 31 December 2023 (2022: €nil). 

The future dividend capacity of the Group is dependent on the liquidity requirements and the distributable reserves of the Group’s 
main operating companies and their capacity to pay dividends to the Company, together with the Company’s distributable reserves 
and liquidity.

As at 31 December 2022, certain debt obligations placed restrictions or conditions on the payment of dividends from the Group’s 
main operating companies to the Company, including a loan to British Airways partially guaranteed by the UKEF and loans to Iberia 
and Vueling partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) in Spain. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had no restrictions on the payment of dividends from the Group’s main operating companies to 
the Company, other than for British Airways, which has several undrawn committed credit facilities for which the commitments 
available are subject to certain conditions depending on the scale of any dividend from British Airways to the Company. 

In addition, British Airways agreed with the Trustee of its main UK defined benefit pension scheme (NAPS) as part of the triennial 
valuation as at 31 March 2021 that, subject to the scheme being in technical deficit, any dividends paid to IAG from 1 January 2024 
through to 31 December 2024, will trigger a pension contribution of 50 per cent of the amount of the dividend. For the period of 1 
January 2025 to 30 September 2025, any dividend in excess of 50 per cent of British Airways’ profit after tax will trigger a pension 
contribution of 50 per cent of the amount of the dividend in excess of the 50 per cent of profit after tax. At 31 December 2023, 
NAPS was in technical surplus, and any dividend that British Airways were to pay to IAG, would not trigger a payment into NAPS 
unless NAPS were to move back into technical deficit. Further details on the British Airways dividend restrictions agreed with NAPS 
are given in note 34a.

See note 35 for details of the amounts recognised in the Cash flow statement for the years to 31 December 2023 and 31 December 
2022.

The Group is exposed to future cash outflows (on an undiscounted basis) at 31 December 2023, for which an amount of €36 million 
(2022: nil) has been recognised in relation to leases not yet commenced to which the Group is committed.

d Maturity profile of the lease liabilities

The maturity profile of the lease liabilities is disclosed in note 29f.

e Extension options

The Group has certain leases which contain extension options exercisable by the Group prior to the non-cancellable contract period. 
Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The Group assesses 
at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options.

The Group is exposed to future cash outflows (on an undiscounted basis) at 31 December 2023, for which no amount has been 
recognised, for potential extension options of €979 million (2022: €945 million) due to it not being reasonably certain that these 
leases will be extended.

f Lessor accounting

The Group leases out certain of its property, plant and equipment. The Group has classified those leases that transfer substantially all 
of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee as finance leases and those leases that do not transfer substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of ownership to the lessee as operating leases.

Finance leases
Rental income from finance leases recognised by the Group in 2023 was €2 million (2022: €4 million). Rental income is recorded 
within Property, IT and other within the Income statement.

1 Capital commitments exclude options to purchase additional aircraft.

2 Total deliveries excludes three Airbus A320 aircraft committed for delivery under lease agreements in 2024. For further information see note 14.

On 30 June 2023 the Group converted 10 Airbus A320neo options into firm orders. The aircraft will be delivered in 2028 and will be 
used by any of the Group’s current airlines to replace A320ceo family aircraft.

On 27 July 2023, the Group converted six Boeing 787-10 options held by British Airways into firm orders and at the same time added 
a further six 787-10 options to its long-haul order book. The Group also converted one Airbus A350-900 option held by Iberia into a 
firm order. These aircraft will be delivered in 2025 and 2026 and will be used by British Airways and Iberia to restore capacity in the 
airlines’ long-haul fleets.

The majority of these commitments are denominated in US dollars translated at the closing exchange rate at the reporting date and 
include escalation clauses dependent on the timing of aircraft deliveries. Under the terms of the committed purchase agreements, 
the Group is required to make periodic progress payments towards the purchase price, with the commitments above stated net of 
progress payments that have been made at the reporting date.

The Group has certain rights to defer aircraft deliveries and to cancel commitments in the event of significant delays to aircraft 
deliveries caused by the aircraft manufacturers. No such rights had been exercised as at 31 December 2023.

16 Non-current assets held for sale

As at 31 December 2023, there were no non-current assets held for sale.

As at 31 December 2022, the non-current assets held for sale of €19 million represented two Airbus A321 aircraft. No gain or loss was 
recognised on classification as non-current assets held for sale. These aircraft were presented within the British Airways segment 
and exited the business during the first half of 2023.

1 Landing rights excludes non-UK and non-EU based landing rights of €63 million (2022: €69 million) that have a definite life.

Basis for calculating recoverable amount
The recoverable amounts of the Group’s CGUs have been measured based on their value-in-use, which utilises a weighted average multi-
scenario discounted cash flow model. The details of these scenarios are given in the going concern section of note 2, with a weighting of 
70 per cent to the Base Case and 30 per cent to the Downside Case. Cash flow projections are based on the business plans approved by 
the relevant operating companies covering a three-year period. Cash flows extrapolated beyond the three-year period are projected to 
increase based on long-term growth rates. Cash flow projections are discounted using each CGU’s pre-tax discount rate.

Annually the relevant operating companies prepare and their respective boards approve three-year business plans, and the IAG 
Board approves the Group three-year business plan in the fourth quarter of the year. Adjustments have been made to the final year 
of the business plan cash flows to incorporate the impacts of climate change that the Group can reliably estimate at the reporting 
date. However, given the long-term nature of the Group’s sustainability commitments, there are other aspects of these commitments 
that cannot be reliably estimated and accordingly have been excluded from the value-in-use calculations (see note 4). The business 
plan cash flows used in the value-in-use calculations also reflect all restructuring of the business where relevant that has been 
approved by the Board and which can be executed by management under existing labour agreements.

Key assumptions
The value-in-use calculations for each CGU reflect the wider economic and geopolitical environments, including updated projected 
cash flows for activity from 2024 through to the end of 2026. For each of the Group’s CGUs the key assumptions used in the value-
in-use calculations are as follows:

Average ASK growth per annum1

Forecast ASKs in the current year modelling represent the range of average annual increases in capacity over the forecast period, 
based on planned network growth and taking into account management’s expectation of the market.

The long-term growth rate is calculated for each CGU, considering a number of data points: (i) industry publications; (ii) forecast 
weighted average exposure in each primary market using gross domestic product (GDP); and (iii) internal analysis regarding the 
long-term changes in consumer preferences and the effects on demand from the increased costs to the Group of climate change. 
The calculation of the long-term growth rate utilises a Base Case and a Downside Case growth rate, which is then weighted on the 
same basis as the cash flows detailed above of 70 per cent to the Base Case and 30 per cent to the Downside Case. The terminal 
value cash flows and long-term growth rate incorporate the impacts of climate change insofar as they can be determined (see note 
4). The airlines’ network plans and the IAG Loyalty forecasts are reviewed annually as part of the three-year business plan 
preparation and reflect management’s plans in response to specific market risk or opportunity.

Pre-tax discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time 
value of money and underlying risks of its primary market. The discount rate calculations are based on the circumstances of the 
airline industry, the loyalty scheme industry, the Group and the CGU. These rates are derived from the weighted average cost of 
capital (WACC). The WACC takes into consideration both debt and equity available to airlines and loyalty schemes. The cost of 
equity is derived from the expected return on investment by airline and loyalty scheme investors and the cost of debt is derived 
from both market data and industry gearing levels derived from comparable companies. CGU-specific risk is incorporated by 
applying individual beta factors which are evaluated annually based on available market data. The pre-tax discount rate reflects the 
timing of future tax flows. The Group engages an external valuation expert as at the valuation date to assist in the determination of 
the post-tax discount rate.

Jet fuel price assumptions are derived from forward price curves in the fourth quarter of each year and sourced externally from 
readily available market data at the valuation date. The cash flow forecasts reflect these price increases after taking into 
consideration the level of fuel derivatives and their associated prices that the Group has in place and the incremental price 
differentials expected for the purchase of SAF.

As detailed above, the Group adjusts the final year of the three-year business plans to incorporate the medium-term impacts of 
climate change from the Group’s Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy through to 2030. These adjustments include the following key 
assumptions: (i) a 10 per cent level of SAF consumption out of the overall fuel mix with an assumed price of €3,412 per metric tonne; 
(ii) a kerosene tax of €526 per metric tonne on all intra-EU flights; (iii) for costs of carbon, prices of €173, €173, €110 and €19 for EU 
ETS allowances, Swiss ETS allowances, UK ETS allowances and CORSIA allowances, respectively, per tonne of CO2 equivalents 
emitted; and (iv) the removal of all free ETS and CORSIA allowances.

Summary of results
At 31 December 2023 management reviewed the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs and concluded the recoverable amounts 
exceeded the carrying values. 

Reasonable possible changes in key assumptions, both individually and in combination, have been considered for each CGU, where 
applicable, which include reducing the operating margin by 2 percentage points in each year, reducing ASKs by 5 percentage points 
in each year, reducing long-term growth rates in the terminal value calculation to zero, increasing pre-tax discount rates by 2.5 
percentage points and increasing the fuel price (both jet fuel and SAF) by 40 per cent, both with cost recovery consistent with that 
experienced historically and with no assumed cost recovery. Given the inherent uncertainty associated with the impact of climate 
change, these sensitivities represent a reasonably possible impact of climate change on the CGUs greater than that included in the 
impairment models.

For the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus CGUs, while the recoverable amounts are estimated to exceed the carrying 
amounts by €15,752 million, €4,736 million, €1,271 million and €1,884 million, respectively, the recoverable amounts would be below 
the carrying amounts when applying reasonable possible but not probable changes, over the forecast period, in assumptions in each 
of the following scenarios:

• British Airways: (i) if ASKs had been 5 per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 24 per cent; 

and (ii) if the fuel price had been 29 per cent higher without cost recovery;

• Iberia: (i) if ASKs had been 5 per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 21 per cent; and (ii) if the 

fuel price had been 24 per cent higher without cost recovery;

• Vueling: (i) if ASKs had been 5 per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 12 per cent; and (ii) if 

the fuel price had been 18 per cent higher without cost recovery; and

• Aer Lingus: (i) if ASKs had been 5 per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase without cost recovery of 16 per cent; and (ii) 

if the fuel price had been 23 per cent higher without cost recovery.

For the remainder of the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions applied to the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer 
Lingus CGUs and for all the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions applied to the IAG Loyalty CGU, no impairment arises.

The credit relating to Other equity investments was €3 million (2022: charge of €3 million).

Investment in Air Europa Holdings
On 15 June 2022, the Group entered into a financing arrangement with Globalia Corporación Empresarial, S,A, (‘Globalia’), whereby, 
the Group provided a €100 million seven-year unsecured loan, which was convertible for a period of two years from inception into a 
fixed number of the shares of Air Europa Holdings, S.L. (‘Air Europa Holdings’), a wholly owned subsidiary of Globalia. Subsequently, 
on 16 August 2022, the Group exercised its exchange option with Globalia and converted the aforementioned loan into an 
investment in 20 per cent of the share capital of Air Europa Holdings, which is recorded as an Other equity investment.

On 23 February 2023, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 80 per cent of the share capital of Air Europa 
Holdings that it had not previously owned. The acquisition is conditional on Globalia receiving approval from the syndicated banks 
that provide the loan agreements that are partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) and Sociedad Estatal de 
Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) in Spain. The acquisition is also subject to approval by relevant competition authorities. Until the 
completion of these approvals, the acquisition does not meet the recognition criteria under IFRS 3 Business combinations, and 
accordingly the Group continues to recognise the 20 per cent share capital ownership of Air Europa Holdings as an Other equity 
investment (see note 2 for critical judgement applied in this classification).

At 31 December 2023, the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings was €129 million, representing an increase of €105 
million from the €24 million recorded at 31 December 2022, with the fair value movement having been recorded within Other 
comprehensive income.

The Group, with its external valuation advisors, determined the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings at 31 December 
2023 and 31 December 2022, using both the market approach and the income approach, whereby the Group used both observable 
market data and unobservable inputs. The fair value was determined on the stand-alone basis of Air Europa Holdings without 
consideration of potential synergies that could be obtained if the Group were able to obtain control over the operations of Air 
Europa Holdings.

In determining the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings at 31 December 2023, the Group used the following significant 
unobservable inputs: (i) revenue compound annual growth rate of 4.0 per cent; (ii) an EBITDA range of 3.6 to 6.5 per cent; and (iii) a 
risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate of 13.9 per cent.

Cash at bank is primarily held in AAA money market funds and bank deposits. Short-term deposits are for periods up to three 
months and earn interest based on the floating deposit rates.

At 31 December 2023, the Group had no outstanding bank overdrafts (2022: €nil).

Current interest-bearing deposits have maturities in excess of three months and typically within 12 months of the reporting date and 
earn interest based on the market rates available at the time the deposit was made.

At 31 December 2023, Aer Lingus held €31 million of restricted cash (2022: €33 million) within interest-bearing deposits maturing 
after more than three months to be used for employee-related obligations.

1 Trade creditors includes €nil (2022: €48 million) due to suppliers that have signed up to supply chain financing programmes offered by a number of 
partner financial institutions. While the Group no longer provides such a service to its suppliers, in 2022, these programmes either or both: (i) the 
suppliers could elect on an invoice-by-invoice basis to receive a discounted early payment from the partner financial institutions rather than being 
paid in line with the agreed payment terms; and/or (ii) the Group could have elected on an invoice-by-invoice basis for the partner financial 
institution to pay the supplier in line with the agreed payment terms and the Group enter into payment terms with the partner financial institution of 
up to 150 days with interest incurred at 2.5 per cent.

The Group, in 2022, assessed the arrangement against indicators to assess if liabilities which suppliers had transferred to the partner financial 
institutions under the supplier financing programmes continued to meet the definition of trade creditors or should have been classified as 
borrowings. The cash flows arising from such arrangements were reported within cash flows from operating activities or within cash flows from 
financing activities, in the Consolidated cash flow statement, depending on whether the associated liabilities met the definition of trade creditors or 
as borrowings.

At 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, these liabilities met the criteria of Trade creditors and are excluded from the Net debt table in note 22b.

2 For the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group has elected to disaggregate accruals and deferred income, which had previously been aggregated 
into a single line item. Accordingly figures for the comparative year to 31 December 2022 have been reclassified to conform with the current year 
presentation.

1 Cash received from customers is net of refunds.

2 Where the Group acts as an agent in the provision of redemption products and services to customers through loyalty programmes, or in the 

provision of interline flights to passengers, revenue is recognised in the Income statement net of the related costs.

3 Included within revenue recognised in the Income statement during 2023 is an amount of €3,914 million previously held as deferred revenue at 1 

January 2023 (recognised during 2022 and previously held as deferred revenue at 1 January 2022: €2,183 million).

4 Included within loyalty points issued to customers at 31 December 2023 is an amount of €161 million (31 December 2022: €82 million) classified within 
Sales in advance of carriage representing the cash component of the consideration paid by customers, where such consideration comprises both 
cash and the redemption of Avios.

5 The 2022 results include an aggregation to conform with the current basis of preparation, where the changes in estimates have been amalgamated 

with revenue recognised in the Income statement. 

The unsatisfied performance obligation under the Group’s customer loyalty programmes that is classified as non-current was €241 
million at 31 December 2023, all of which is expected to be recognised as revenue within one to five years from the reporting date.

Deferred revenue relating to customer loyalty programmes consists primarily of consideration allocated to performance obligations 
associated with Avios. Avios are issued by the Group’s airlines through their loyalty programmes, or are sold to third parties such as 
credit card providers, who issue them as part of their loyalty programmes. While Avios do not have an expiry date and can be 
redeemed at any time in the future, a customer’s membership account is closed if there is a period of 36 months of inactivity in 
terms of both issuances and redemptions. Revenue may therefore be recognised at any time in the future. 

Unredeemed vouchers liability
At 31 December 2023 the Group recognised €645 million in respect of unredeemed vouchers, including associated taxes (2022: €911 
million) within Deferred revenue. Of the €645 million, €139 million relates to vouchers issued due to COVID-19 pandemic flight 
cancellations, referred to as ‘disrupted flights’ and €506 million relates to non-disrupted voucher issuance, such as the British 
Airways ‘Book with Confidence’ policy (where customers were provided the flexibility to change their destination and/or date of 
travel on non-disrupted flights), certain other flexible fare options, non-air partner companion vouchers and gift vouchers.

The jurisdiction in which a voucher is issued, dictates the period over which a customer can redeem the voucher, which ranges up to 
six years from the point of issuance. This period of time is also influenced by whether the voucher was issued for disrupted flights or 
non-disrupted issuance and whether statutory or commercial expiry policies prevail. The Group expects the majority of the total 
voucher liability to mature within 12 months of the reporting date.

During, and subsequent to, the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group, across each of its operating companies, has 
engaged in marketing campaigns and direct customer engagement in an attempt to maximise redemption of these vouchers. 
Despite these efforts, the Group expects some of these vouchers to expire unredeemed. The Group estimates the number of these 
vouchers, both for disrupted flights and non-disrupted issuance, not expected to be redeemed prior to expiry using statistical 
modelling based on historical experience and expected future redemptions, recognising this estimated value as passenger revenue 
when it can be reasonably determined that there will not be a significant reversal of this revenue in future accounting periods. 

A 5 percentage point increase in the assumption of the number of vouchers outstanding at 31 December 2023 and not expected to 
be redeemed prior to expiry would result in a reduction to Deferred revenue of €32 million, with an offsetting adjustment to increase 
Passenger revenue and Operating profit recognised in the year.

borrowings.

Long-term borrowings of the Group amounting to €4,516 million (31 December 2022: €3,962 million) are secured on owned fleet 
assets with a net book value of €4,736 million (31 December 2022: €3,931 million). All asset financed liabilities, included within long-
term borrowings, are all secured on the associated aircraft or other property, plant and equipment.

1 See details of the 2028 convertible bond below.

2 On 25 March 2021, the Group issued two tranches of senior unsecured bonds for an aggregate principal amount of €1.2 billion, €500 million due 

25 March 2025 and €700 million due 25 March 2029. The bonds bear a fixed rate of interest of 2.75 per cent and 3.75 per cent per annum, payable in 
arrears, respectively. The bonds were issued at 100 per cent of their principal amount, respectively, and, unless previously redeemed or purchased 
and cancelled, will be redeemed at 100 per cent of their principal amount on their respective maturity dates.

3 In July 2019, the Group issued two tranches of senior unsecured bonds for an aggregate principal amount of €1 billion, €500 million due 4 July 2023 
and €500 million due 4 July 2027. The 2023 bond bore a fixed rate of interest of 0.5 per cent per annum and was redeemed in full at maturity on 4 
July 2023. The 2027 bond bears a fixed rate of interest of 1.5 per cent per annum annually payable in arrears. The 2027 bond was issued at 98.803 
per cent of its principal amount, and, unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled, will be redeemed at 100 per cent of its principal 
amount on its maturity date.

4 Floating rate euro mortgage loans are secured on specific aircraft assets of the Group and bear interest of between 4.45 and 5.46 per cent. The loans 

are repayable between 2024 and 2027.

5 Total of €55 million fixed rate secured bonds with 3.75 per cent coupon repayable between 2024 and 2027. 

6 Fixed rate unsecured US dollar mortgage loan bearing interest between 1.38 to 2.86 per cent. The loan is repayable between 2025 and 2026.

7 Fixed rate unsecured euro loans with the Spanish State (Department of Industry) bear nil interest and are repayable in 2031.

8 On 22 February 2021, British Airways entered into a floating rate five-year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of €2.3 billion (£2.0 

billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by the UKEF. On 1 November 2021, British Airways entered 
into a further five-year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of €1.1 billion (£1.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per 
cent of the principal guaranteed by the UKEF. On 28 September 2023, British Airways repaid the £2.0 billion term loan in full, while concurrently 
entering into a further five-year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of €1.2 billion (£1.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, 
with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by the UKEF. The terms and maturity of the Export Development Guarantee Facility entered into in 
November 2021 remain unchanged. These two remaining UKEF guaranteed facilities had not been drawn as at 31 December 2023.

9 On 30 April 2020, Iberia and Vueling entered into floating rate syndicated financing agreements of €750 million and €260 million respectively. On 31 

October 2023, Iberia repaid its loan in full. On 30 November 2023, Vueling repaid its loan in full.

10 On 23 December 2020, Aer Lingus entered into a floating rate financing agreement with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) for €75 million. 
On 27 March 2021, Aer Lingus entered into a further floating rate financing agreement with the ISIF for an additional €75 million. On 4 March 2022, 
Aer Lingus entered into a financing arrangement with ISIF, which subsequently extinguished the existing €150 million of facilities and replaced them 
with a €350 million facility that matures in March 2025. On 13 December 2022 and 4 March 2023, Aer Lingus early repaid €100 million and €50 
million, respectively, of the ISIF facility, with these amounts being available to draw again over the tenor of the facility. The facility is secured on 
specific landing rights. At 31 December 2023, €350 million of this facility remained undrawn.

In addition, on 23 March 2021, the Group entered into a three-year US dollar secured Revolving Credit Facility of $1.755 billion 
accessible by British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus. On 23 August 2022, the Group extended the term of the Revolving Credit 
Facility by an additional 12 months through to March 2025. On 23 August 2023, of the $1.755 billion facility, the Group further 
extended the terms of the $1.655 billion Revolving Credit Facility by an additional 12 months through to March 2026 with the 
remaining $100 million available through to March 2025. As at 31 December 2023 no amounts had been drawn under the facility 
(2022: nil). While the Group does not forecast drawing down on the Revolving Credit Facility, should it do so, the resultant debt 
would be secured, in the respective operating companies, against: (i) specific landing rights; or (ii) aircraft; or (iii) or a combination of 
both.

Details of the 2028 convertible bond
On 11 May 2021, the Group issued the €825 million fixed rate 1.125 per cent senior unsecured bond convertible into ordinary shares of 
IAG. The convertible bond raised net proceeds of €818 million and matures in 2028. The Group holds an option to redeem the 
convertible bond at its principal amount, together with accrued interest, no earlier than two years prior to the final maturity date. 

The convertible bond provides bondholders with dividend protection and includes a total of 244,850,715 options at inception and at 
31 December 2023 to convert into ordinary shares of IAG. The Group also holds an option to redeem the convertible bond, in full or 
in part, in cash in the event that bondholders exercise their right to convert the bond into ordinary shares of IAG. The bondholders 
conversion right is currently exercisable.

The convertible bond is recorded at its fair value, which at 31 December 2023 was €735 million (2022: €605 million), representing an 
increase of €130 million since 1 January 2023. Of this increase, the charge recorded in Other comprehensive income arising from 
credit risk of the convertible bonds was €119 million and a charge recorded within Finance costs in the Income statement attributable 
to changes in market conditions of €11 million.

Transactions with unconsolidated entities
The Group has entered into asset financing transactions with unconsolidated entities as follows:

• The British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2019-1 were entered into in the third quarter of 2019, recognising Asset 

financed liabilities of €725 million for eight aircraft that mature between 2029 and 2034;

• The British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2020-1 were entered into in the fourth quarter of 2020, recognising Asset

Restoration and handback provisions
Provisions for restoration and handback costs are maintained to meet the contractual maintenance and return conditions on aircraft 
held under lease. For those obligations arising on inception of an aircraft lease, the associated estimated cost is capitalised within the 
ROU asset. For those obligations that arise through usage or through the passage of time, the associated estimated costs are 
recognised in the Income statement as the associated asset is used or through the passage of time. The provision is long term in 
nature, typically covering the leased asset term, which for aircraft is up to 12 years. 

The provisions also include an amount relating to leased land and buildings where restoration costs are contractually required at the 
end of the lease. Such costs are capitalised within ROU assets.

The provisions are determined by discounting the future cash flows using pre-tax risk-free rates specific to the tenor of the provision 
and the currency in which it arises. The unwinding of the discounting of the provisions is recorded as a finance cost in the Income 
statement (see note 9a).

Remeasurements arising from changes in estimates relating to the effects of both discounting and inflation are recorded in the 
Income statement to the extent they relate to avoidable provisions or recorded as an adjustment to the right of use asset (see note 
14) for those unavoidable provisions.

Where amounts are finalised and the uncertainty relating to these provisions removed, the associated liability is reclassified to either 
current or non-current Other creditors, dependent on the expecting timing of settlement.

Restructuring provisions
The restructuring provision includes provisions for voluntary redundancies including the collective redundancy programme for Iberia's 
Transformation Plan implemented prior to 2023, which provides for payments to affected employees until they reach the statutory 
retirement age. The amount provided for has been determined by an actuarial valuation made by independent actuaries, and was 
based on the same assumptions as those made to determine the provisions for obligations to flight crew below, with the exception of 
the discount rate, which in this case was 3.2 per cent. The payments related to this provision will continue over the next six years. 

At 31 December 2023, €88 million of this provision related to collective redundancy programmes (2022: €185 million).

Employee leaving indemnities and other employee related provisions
This provision includes employee leaving indemnities relating to staff under various contractual arrangements. As part of these 
provisions, the Group recognises provisions relating to the Iberia flight crew (both pilots and cabin crew):

• Pilots – under the relevant collective bargaining agreement, pilots have the option at the age of 60 to elect to: continue in full-time 

employment; being placed on reserve and retaining their employment relationship until reaching the statutory retirement age 
(referred to as ‘active’); or alternatively taking early retirement (referred to as ‘inactive’). Additionally, and in certain cases, those 
pilots from the age of 55, may apply for retaining their employment relationship, but with reduced activity (referred to as ‘special 
leave’); and

• Cabin crew – under the relevant collective bargaining agreement, cabin crew have the option at the age of 62 to elect to: continue 

in full-time employment; being transferred to active status; or being transferred to inactive status. Additionally, and in certain 
cases, those cabin crew employees from the age of 57, may apply for ‘special leave’.

The Group is required to remunerate these employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. In determining the provision to 
be recognised for the proportion of employees that will elect either special leave or to be inactive, the Group estimates a number of 
financial assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) medium to long-term salary growth and inflation; (ii) the discount rate to 
apply; (iii) the rate of public social security growth; (iv) mortality rates; and (v) staff turnover.

The provision was re-assessed at 31 December 2023 with the use of independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, 
based on a discount rate consistent with the iBoxx index of 3.17 per cent for active employees and 2.98 per cent for inactive 
employees (2022: iBoxx index of 3.72 per cent and 3.50 per cent, respectively), the PER_Col_2020.1er.orden. mortality tables, and 
assuming contractual salary increases of up to 3.8 per cent in 2024 and 3.3 per cent in 2025 and then 2.0 per cent per annum 
thereafter derived from increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). At 31 December 2023, there were a total of 5,179 flight crew (31 
December 2022: 4,827) eligible for making such elections when they reach the age of 60. At 31 December 2023, there were 479 
employees who had not reached the age of retirement, and eligible to elect for early retirement (‘special leave’) who had elected to 
become inactive (31 December 2022: 426). In addition, at 31 December 2023, there were 25 employees having reached the age of 
retirement, who had elected to become inactive (31 December 2022: 15).

At 31 December 2023, the average length of employment of the eligible flight crew was 17 years (31 December 2022: 18 years). This is 
mainly a long-term provision. Remeasurements in the valuation of this provision are recorded in Other comprehensive income. The 
amount relating to this provision was €677 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: €611 million).

Legal claims and contractual disputes provisions
Legal claims and contractual disputes provisions include:

• amounts for multi-party claims from groups of employees on a number of matters related to their employment, including claims 

for additional holiday pay and for age discrimination;

• amounts related to ongoing contractual disputes arising from the Group’s operations; and
• amounts related to investigations by a number of competition authorities in connection with alleged anti-competitive activity 

concerning the Group’s passenger and cargo businesses.

The final amount required to settle the remaining claims and fines is subject to uncertainty.

ETS provisions
ETS provisions relate to the Emissions Trading Scheme for CO2 equivalent emitted on flights within the EU, Switzerland and the UK 
and due to be extinguished in the year subsequent to the reporting date through settlement with the relevant authorities. See notes 
2 and 4 for further information.

Corporate GovernanceStrategic ReportFinancial Statements28 Contingent liabilities

There are a number of legal and regulatory proceedings against the Group in a number of jurisdictions which at 31 December 2023, 
where they could be reliably estimated, but excluding the Vueling hand luggage matter detailed below, amounted to €58 million (31 
December 2022: €11 million). The Group does not consider it probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources with 
regard to these proceedings and accordingly no provisions have been recorded.

Contingent liabilities associated with income taxes, deferred taxes and indirect taxes are presented in note 10.

Included in contingent liabilities is the following:

Air Europa Holdings acquisition break-fee
On 23 February 2023, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 80 per cent of the share capital of Air Europa 
Holdings from Globalia that it had not previously owned. The acquisition is conditional on Globalia receiving approval from the 
syndicated banks that provide the loan agreements that are partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) and 
Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) in Spain. The acquisition is also subject to approval by relevant competition 
authorities.

In the event that the relevant approvals, detailed above, are not forthcoming within 24 months of entering into the agreement or the 
Group terminates the agreement at any time prior to completion, then the Group is required to pay a break-fee to Globalia of €50 
million. Under the agreement, this 24-month period can be extended, by mutual consent.

At 31 December 2023 and through to the date of the consolidated financial statements, the Group considers that it is probable that 
the acquisition will successfully complete and accordingly does not consider it probable that the break-fee shall be paid. Given the 
above the Group does not consider it appropriate to record a provision for the break-fee.

Vueling commercial hand luggage policy
In the year ended 31 December 2023, Vueling received a number of information requests from the Ministerio de Consumo (Ministry 
of Consumer Affairs) in Spain, with regard to its commercial hand luggage policy, for which Vueling complied with. On 12 January 
2024, the Ministerio de Consumo issued Vueling with a List of Charges asserting that the Vueling commercial hand luggage policy 
infringes consumers rights under Article 47.1 of Royal Legislative Decree 1/2007. While the List of Charges notifies Vueling of its 
intention to sanction the company for such infringements, it stipulates that the basis for determining such penalties is subject to the 
provision of further information by the company. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate reliably any exposure that may arise from 
this matter until ongoing proceedings with the Ministerio de Consumo are further progressed. The Group, with its advisors, has 
reviewed the correspondence and List of Charges from the Ministerio de Consumo and considers it has strong arguments to support 
its commercial hand luggage policy and does not consider it probable that an adverse outcome will result in the future. As such, the 
Group does not consider it appropriate to record any provision. The Group expects further developments on this matter during the 
remainder of 2024.

29 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including fuel price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. The principal impacts of these on the financial statements are discussed below:

a Fuel price risk

The Group is exposed to fuel price risk. In order to mitigate such risk, under the Group’s fuel price risk management strategy a 
variety of over the counter derivative instruments are entered into. The Group strategy is to hedge a proportion of fuel consumption 
up to two years within the approved hedging profile.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s principal exposure to a reasonable possible change in the fuel price, 
based on current market volatility, with all other variables held constant on the profit before tax and equity1. The sensitivity analysis 
has been performed on fuel derivatives (both those designated in hedge relationships and those not designated in hedge 
relationships) at the reporting date only and is not reflective of the impact had the sensitised rates been applied through the 
duration of the years to 31 December 2023 and 2022.

During 2023, following a substantial recovery in the global price of crude oil and jet fuel, which continues to be impacted by 
geopolitical events, the fair value of such net liability derivative instruments was €115 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: net asset of 
€87 million), representing a decrease of €202 million since 1 January 2023. Of the carrying amount of the net liability at 31 December 
2023, all (2022: all) of the associated derivatives were designated within hedge relationships.

b Foreign currency risk

The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than 
the functional currency of each of the Group’s operating companies, being pound sterling and the euro. The currencies in which 
these transactions are denominated are primarily US dollar, pound sterling and the euro. The Group has a number of strategies to 
hedge foreign currency risk including hedging a proportion of its foreign currency sales and purchases for up to three years.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s principal foreign exchange exposure to a reasonable possible change 
in the US dollar, pound sterling and Japanese yen exchange rates, based on current market volatility, with all other variables held 
constant on the profit before tax and equity1. The sensitivity analysis has been performed on interest-bearing liabilities, lease 
liabilities and derivatives (both those designated in hedge relationships and those not designated in hedge relationships) 
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date only and is not reflective of the impact had the sensitised rates been applied 
through the duration of the years to 31 December 2023 and 2022.

1 The sensitivity analysis on equity, excludes the sensitivity amounts recognised in the profit before tax.

At 31 December 2023, the fair value of foreign currency net liability derivative instruments was €357 million (2022: net asset of €108 
million), representing a decrease of €465 million since 1 January 2023. These comprise both derivatives designated in hedge 
relationships and those derivatives that are not designated in a hedge relationship at inception. Of the carrying amount of the net 
liability at 31 December 2023, €151 million (2022: net asset of €96 million) of the associated derivatives were designated within hedge 
relationships. Those derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship on inception have their mark-to-market movements recorded 
directly in the Income statement and recognised within Net currency retranslation credits/(charges).

c Interest rate risk

The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates on debt and on cash deposits. In order to mitigate the interest rate risk, the 
Group’s policies allow a variety of over the counter derivative instruments to be entered into.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s interest rate exposure to a reasonable possible change in the US 
dollar, euro and sterling interest rates, based on expectations regarding forward rate movements, on the profit before tax and 
equity1. The sensitivity analysis has been performed on interest rate derivatives (both those designated in hedge relationships and 
those not designated in hedge relationships) at the reporting date only and is not reflective of the impact had the sensitised rates 
been applied through the duration of the years to 31 December 2023 and 2022.

At 31 December 2023, the fair value of interest rate net asset derivative instruments was €28 million (2022: net asset of €60 million), 
representing a decrease of €32 million since 1 January 2023. Of the carrying amount of net asset at 31 December 2023, all (2022: all) 
of the associated derivatives were designated within hedge relationships. 

d Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a 
financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, 
foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. The Group has policies and procedures to monitor the risk by 
assigning limits to each counterparty by underlying exposure and by operating company and by only entering into transactions with 
counterparties with a very low credit risk.

At each period end, the Group assesses the effect of counterparties’ and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of derivatives 
and any ineffectiveness arising is immediately recognised in the Income statement within Other non-operating credits.

e Counterparty risk

The Group is exposed to the non-performance by its counterparties in respect of financial assets receivable. The Group has policies 
and procedures to monitor the risk by assigning limits to each counterparty by underlying exposure and by operating company. The 
underlying exposures are monitored on a daily basis and the overall exposure limit by counterparty is periodically reviewed by using 
available market information.

The financial assets recognised in the financial statements, net of impairment losses (if any), represent the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk, without taking into account any guarantees in place or other credit enhancements.

At 31 December 2023 the Group’s credit risk position, allocated by region, in respect of treasury managed cash and derivatives was as follows:

The Group invests cash in interest-bearing accounts, time deposits and money market funds, choosing instruments with appropriate 
maturities or liquidity to retain sufficient headroom to readily generate cash inflows required to manage liquidity risk. The Group has 
also committed revolving credit facilities.

At 31 December 2023, the Group had undrawn overdraft facilities of €53 million (2022: €53 million).

g Offsetting financial assets and liabilities

The Group enters into derivative transactions under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) documentation. In 
general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding 
are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other.

The following financial assets and liabilities are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar 
agreements.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, to maintain an 
optimal capital structure, to reduce the cost of capital and to provide returns to shareholders.

The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items ratio. For the year to 31 December 
2023, the net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items was 1.7 times (2022: 3.1 times). The definition and calculation for this 
performance measure is included in the Alternative performance measures section.

Further detail on liquidity and capital resources and capital risk management is disclosed in the going concern section in note 2.

b Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities

The fair values of the Group’s financial instruments are disclosed in hierarchy levels depending on the nature of the inputs used in 
determining the fair values and using the following methods and assumptions:

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. A market is regarded as active if quoted 
prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and 
those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. Level 1 methodologies (market 
values at the balance sheet date) were used to determine the fair value of listed asset investments classified as equity investments 
and listed interest-bearing borrowings. The fair value of financial liabilities and financial assets incorporates own credit risk and 
counterparty credit risk, respectively.

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 
indirectly. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by valuation techniques. These 
valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific 
estimates. 

Derivative instruments are measured based on the market value of instruments with similar terms and conditions using forward 
pricing models, which include forward exchange rates, forward interest rates, forward fuel curves and corresponding volatility 
surface data at the reporting date. The fair value of the principal derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows, 
incorporating adjustments for own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:

• commodity reference contracts including swaps and options transactions, referenced to: (i) CIF NWE cargoes jet fuel; (ii) ICE 

Gasoil; (iii) ICE Brent; (iv) ICE Gasoil Brent crack; (v) Jet Differential and (vi) Jet fuel Brent crack - the mark-to-market valuation 
prices are determined by reference to current forward curve and standard option pricing valuation models, values are discounted 
to the reporting date based on the corresponding interest rate;

• currency forward and option contracts – by reference to current forward prices and standard option pricing valuation models, 

values are discounted to the reporting date based on the corresponding interest rate; and

• interest rate swap contracts – by discounting the future cash flows of the swap contracts at market interest rate valued with the 

current forward curve.

The fair value of the Group’s interest-bearing borrowings, excluding lease liabilities, is determined by discounting the remaining 
contractual cash flows at the relevant market interest rates at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the Group’s interest-bearing 
borrowings is adjusted for own credit risk.

Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. The principal method of such valuation is 
performed using a valuation model that considers the present value of the dividend cash flows expected to be generated by the 
associated assets. For other equity investments where cash flow information is not available, an adjusted net asset method is 
applied. For the methodology in the determination of the fair value of the investment in Air Europa Holdings, see note 19.

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, other current interest-bearing deposits, trade receivables, other current assets and trade 
and other payables approximate their carrying value largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

During the year to 31 December 2023, the Group recorded a transfer of an Other equity instrument of €1 million from Level 3 to 
Level 1 following the public listing of the associated investment. There have been no other transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy during the year.

d Hedges

Cash flow hedges
At 31 December 2023, the Group’s principal risk management activities that were hedging future forecast transactions were:

• foreign exchange contracts, hedging foreign currency exchange risk on cash inflows and certain operational payments. 

Remeasurement gains and losses on the derivatives are (i) recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement, where 
the hedged item is recorded directly in the Income statement, to the same caption as the underlying hedged item is classified; (ii) 
recognised in equity and transferred to the Balance sheet, where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability, are recorded 
to the Balance sheet to the same caption as the hedged item is recognised; and (iii) recognised in equity and transferred to the 
Income statement, where the hedged item is a financial asset or liability, at the same time as the financial asset or liability is 
recorded in the Income statement. Reclassification gains and losses on derivatives, arising from the discontinuance of hedge 
accounting, are recognised in the Income statement when the future transaction is no longer expected to occur and recorded in 
the relevant Income statement caption to which the hedged item is classified;

• crude, gas oil and jet kerosene derivative contracts, hedging price risk on fuel expenditure. Remeasurement gains and losses on 

the derivatives are: (i) recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges to 
match against the related fuel cash outflow, where the underlying hedged item does not give rise to the recognition of fuel 
inventory; and (ii) recognised in equity and transferred to the Balance sheet within Inventory, where the underlying hedged item is 
fuel inventory. Gains and losses recorded within Inventory are recognised in the Income statement when the underlying fuel 
inventory is consumed, within Fuel, oil costs and emission charges. Reclassification gains and losses on derivatives, arising from the 
discontinuance of hedge accounting, are recognised in the Income statement within Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges when 
the future transaction is no longer expected to occur;

• interest rate contracts, hedging interest rate risk on floating rate debt and certain operational payments. Remeasurement gains 
and losses on the derivatives are recognised in equity and transferred to the Income statement within Interest expense; and
• future loan repayments denominated in foreign currency are designated in a hedge relationship hedging foreign exchange 

fluctuations on revenue cash inflows. Remeasurement gains and losses on the associated loans are recognised in equity and 
transferred to the Balance sheet, where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability when the loan repayments are made 
(generally in instalments over the life of the loan).

The amounts included in equity are summarised below:

1 Expenditure includes both operating and capital expenditure.

2 Notional amounts of fuel commodity price hedging instruments represent 10.0 million metric tonnes of jet fuel equivalent and the hedge range is 

expressed as the US dollar price per metric tonne, which for those products typically priced in barrels, has been determined using a conversion factor

Fair value hedges
At 31 December 2023, the Group’s principal risk management activities associated with fair value hedging were related to interest 
rate contracts hedging the fair value risk on fixed rate lease liabilities. Remeasurement gains and losses on both the derivatives and 
the host financial liability are recognised in Income statement within Other non-operating credits.

The carrying values of the hedged items and hedging instruments of the Group’s fair value hedges at 31 December 2023 are as 
follows:

During the year to 31 December 2023, the Group purchased 42.0 million shares at a weighted average share price of €1.83 per share 
totalling €77 million, which are held as Treasury shares. A total of 3.3 million shares (2022: 8.1 million) were issued to employees 
during the year as a result of vesting of employee share schemes. At 31 December 2023 the Group held 55.8 million shares (2022: 17.1 
million) which represented 1.12 per cent (2022: 0.34 per cent) of the issued share capital of the Company.

32 Share-based payments

The Group operates share-based payment schemes as part of the total remuneration package provided to employees. These 
schemes comprise both share option schemes where employees acquire shares at an option price and share award plans whereby 
shares are issued to employees at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets.

a IAG Performance Share Plan

The IAG Performance Share Plan (PSP) was granted to senior executives and managers of the Group who are most directly involved 
in shaping and delivering business success over the medium to long term. Awards made from 2015 to 2020 were nil-cost options, 
with a two-year holding period following the three-year performance period, before options can be exercised. All awards had three 
independent performance measures with equal weighting: Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Travel 
and Leisure Index (2020 awards) or MSCI European Transportation Index (prior to 2020 awards), earnings per share, and Return on 
Invested Capital.

b IAG Restricted Share Plan

The IAG Restricted Share Plan (RSP) was introduced in 2021 to increase the alignment of both interests and outcomes between the 
Group’s senior management and shareholders through the build-up and maintenance of senior management shareholdings and an 
increased focus on the long-term, sustainable performance of the Group. Awards have been made as conditional awards, with a two-
year holding period following the three-year vesting period. There are no performance measures associated with the awards. Vesting 
will be contingent on the satisfaction of a discretionary underpin, normally assessed over three financial years commencing from the 
financial year in which the award was granted. Approval at the end of the vesting period will be at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, considering the Group’s overall performance, including financial and non-financial performance measures 
over the course of the vesting period, as well as any material risk or regulatory failures identified.

c IAG Full Potential Incentive Plan

In 2021, the Group launched the Full Potential Incentive Plan (FPIP), which was granted to key individuals involved in the delivery of a 
series of transformation projects that will enable the Group to deliver business success over the medium to long term. The awards 
have been made as conditional awards, vesting in 2025 and dependent on stretch performance targets for 2024 and the approval of 
the Board.

d IAG Incentive Award Deferral Plan

The IAG Incentive Award Deferral Plan (IADP) is granted to qualifying employees based on performance and service tests. It will be 
awarded when an annual incentive award is triggered subject to the employee remaining in employment with the Group for three 
years after the grant date. The relevant population will receive 50 per cent of their incentive award up front in cash, and the 
remaining 50 per cent in shares after three years through the IADP.

1 The unrealised gains and losses reserve records fair value changes on equity investments and the portion of the amounts on hedging instruments in 

cash flow hedges that are determined to be effective hedges. The amounts at 31 December 2023 that relate to the fair value changes on equity 
instruments and to the cash flow hedge reserve were €138 million credit and €305 million charge, respectively.

2 The cost of hedging reserve records, amongst others, changes on the time value of options.

3 The currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of non-euro functional currency 

subsidiaries and investments accounted for under the equity method into the Group’s reporting currency of euros. The movement through this 
reserve is affected by the fluctuations in the pound sterling to euro foreign exchange translation rate.

4 During 2022, the Group redeemed the €500 million convertible bond with no conversion into ordinary shares. On redemption, an amount of €62 

million was transferred to Retained earnings.

5 The merger reserve originated from the merger transaction between British Airways and Iberia. The balance represents the difference between the 

fair value of the Group on the transaction date, and the fair value of Iberia and the book value of British Airways (including its reserves).

6 Capital reserves include a Redeemed capital reserve of €70 million (2022: €70 million) associated with the decrease in share capital relating to 

cancelled shares and a Share capital reduction reserve of €797 million (2022: €797 million) associated with a historical reduction in the nominal value 
of the Company’s share capital.

34 Employee benefit obligations

The Group operates a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements, covering both defined contribution and defined benefit 
schemes. The Group also has a scheme for flight crew who meet certain conditions and therefore have the option of being placed on 
reserve and retaining their employment relationship until reaching the statutory retirement age, or taking early retirement (see note 
27).

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for its employees.

Costs recognised in respect of defined contribution pension plans in Spain, UK and Ireland for the year to 31 December 2023 were 
€279 million (2022: €251 million).

Defined benefit schemes
The principal funded defined benefit pension schemes within the Group are the Airways Pension Scheme (APS) and the New 
Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS), both of which are in the UK and are closed to new members.

APS has been closed to new members since 1984, but remains open to future accrual. The benefits provided under APS are based on 
final average pensionable pay and, for the majority of members, are subject to inflationary increases in payment.

NAPS has been closed to new members since 2003 and closed to future accrual since 2018. Following closure, members’ deferred 
pensions are increased annually by inflation up to 5 per cent per annum (measured using the Government’s annual Pension Increase 
(Review) Orders, which since 2011 have been based on CPI). 

APS and NAPS are governed by separate Trustee Boards. Although APS and NAPS have separate Trustee Boards, certain aspects of 
the business of the two schemes are common. APS and NAPS have developed certain joint working groups that are attended by the 
Trustee Board members of each scheme although each Trustee Board reaches its decisions independently. There are sub-
committees which are separately responsible for the governance, operation and investments of each scheme. British Airways 
Pension Trustees Limited holds the assets of both schemes on behalf of their respective Trustees.

Triennially, the Trustees of APS and NAPS undertake actuarial valuations, which are subsequently agreed with British Airways to 
determine the cash contributions and any deficit payment plans through to the next valuation date, as well as ensuring that the 
schemes have sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments to members. These actuarial valuations are prepared using 
the principles set out in UK Pension legislation. This differs from the IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ valuation, which is used for deriving 
the Income statement and Balance sheet positions and uses a best-estimate approach overall. The different purpose and principles 
lead to different assumptions being used, and therefore a different estimate for the liabilities and funding levels.

During 2022, the triennial valuations, as at 31 March 2021, were finalised for APS and NAPS which resulted in a technical surplus of 
€343 million (£295 million) for APS and a technical deficit of €1,887 million (£1,650 million) for NAPS. The actuarial valuations 
performed for APS and NAPS are different to the valuation performed as at 31 December 2023 under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ 
mainly due to timing differences of the measurement dates and to the specific scheme assumptions in the actuarial valuation 
performed as at 31 March 2021 compared with IAS 19 requirements used in the accounting valuation assumptions as at the reporting 
date. The actuarial valuation of neither APS and NAPS is updated outside of the triennial valuations, making comparability between 
the scheme liabilities applying the principles set out in the UK Pension legislation and the requirements of IAS 19 not possible. The 
principal difference relates to the discount rate applied, which under the triennial actuarial valuation, aligns with a prudent estimate 
of the future investment returns on the assets of the respective schemes, whereas, under IAS 19, the rates are based on high-quality 
corporate bond yields, regardless of how the assets are invested.

The triennial valuation as at 31 March 2021 for NAPS supersedes the previous agreements reached in 2020 and 2021 between British 
Airways and the Trustee of NAPS relating to the deferral of deficit contributions. The deferred deficit contributions have been 
incorporated into the deficit payment plan agreed as part of the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2021.

As part of the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2021 for NAPS, British Airways has agreed to provide certain property assets as 
security, which will remain in place until 30 September 2028.

Other plans
British Airways also operates post-retirement schemes in a number of jurisdictions outside of the UK. The principal scheme is the 
British Airways Plc Pension Plan (USA) based in the United States and referred to as the ‘US Plan’. The US Plan is considered to be a 
defined benefit scheme and is closed to new members and to future accrual.

The majority of British Airways’ other plans are fully funded, but there are also a number of unfunded plans, for which the Group 
meets the benefit payment obligations as they fall due.

In addition, Aer Lingus operates certain defined benefit plans, both funded and unfunded.

International Airlines Group | Annual Report and Accounts 2023

Notes to the accounts continuedRisk associated with the defined benefit schemes
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a range of risks, with the following being the most significant:

• asset volatility risk - the scheme obligations are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high-quality corporate bond 

yields. If scheme assets underperform this yield, this will reduce the surplus / increase the deficit, depending on the scheme. 
Certain of the schemes hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long 
term while creating volatility and risk in the short term;

• longevity risk – the majority of the scheme obligations are to provide benefits over the life of the scheme members. An increase in 

life expectancy will result in a corresponding increase in the defined benefit obligation;

• interest rate risk – a decrease in interest rates will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the 

value of certain of the scheme assets; 

• inflation risk – a significant proportion of the scheme obligations are linked to inflation, such that any increase in inflation will cause 
an increase in the obligations. While certain of the scheme assets are indexed to inflation, any expected increase in the scheme 
assets from inflation would be disproportionately lower than the increase in the scheme obligations; and 

• currency risk – a number of scheme assets are denominated in currencies other than the pound sterling. Weakening of those 

currencies, or strengthening of the pound sterling, in the long term, will have the effect of reducing the value of scheme assets.

a Cash payments and funding arrangements

Cash payments in respect to pension obligations comprise normal employer contributions by the Group and deficit contributions 
based on the agreed deficit payment plan with NAPS. Total payments for the year to 31 December 2023 net of service costs made 
by the Group were €48 million (2022: €20 million) being the employer contributions of €49 million (2022: €22 million) less the 
current service cost of €1 million (2022: €2 million) (note 34b,c).

Future funding arrangements
Pension contributions for APS and NAPS were determined by actuarial valuations made at 31 March 2021, using assumptions and 
methodologies agreed between the Group and Trustee of each scheme. 

In total, the Group expects to pay €1 million in employer contributions to APS and NAPS in 2024.

The following graph provides the undiscounted benefit payments to be made by the Trustees of APS and NAPS over the remaining 
expected duration of the schemes:

The amounts and timing of these projected benefit payments are subject to the aforementioned risks to the schemes.

Deficit contributions
At the date of the actuarial valuation, the actuarial deficit of NAPS amounted to €1,887 million. In order to address the deficit in the 
scheme, the Group committed to deficit contribution payments through to 30 June 2023, amounting to approximately €58 million 
per year, increasing by €58 million each year up to 30 June 2026 and subsequently capped at €257 million per year through to 31 
May 2032. The deficit contribution plan includes an over-funding protection mechanism, based on the triennial valuation 
methodology for measuring the deficit, whereby deficit contributions are suspended if the funding position reaches 100 per cent, 
with a mechanism for contributions to resume if the contribution level subsequently falls below 100 per cent, or until such point as 
the scheme funding level reaches 100 per cent.

During the year ended and as at 31 December 2023, the NAPS funding position exceeded 100 per cent and accordingly 
deficit contributions were suspended. At 31 December 2023, the valuation of the funding level incorporates significant forward-
looking assumptions, such that the Group currently does not expect to make further deficit contributions. Given the long-term 
nature of the NAPS scheme, these assumptions are subject to uncertainty and there can be no guarantee that deficit contributions 
will not resume in the future or that additional deficit contributions will not need to be incorporated into future triennial 
actuarial valuations.

At 31 December 2023, had the over-funding protection mechanism not been applied, then the asset ceiling adjustment (as detailed 
in note 34c) would have been €638 million higher, reducing the surplus accordingly.

1 Committed deficit contributions, agreed as part of the 31 March 2021 actuarial valuation, were suspended at 31 December 2023 as an effect of the 

over-funding protection mechanism.

Deficit payments in respect of local arrangements outside of the UK have been determined in accordance with local practice.

Under the triennial valuation of NAPS as at 31 March 2021, in the period up to 31 December 2023, no dividend payment was 
permitted from British Airways to IAG. In the period from 1 January to 31 December 2024, any dividends paid by British Airways will 
be matched by contributions to NAPS of 50 per cent of the value of dividends paid. In the period from 1 January to 30 September 
2025, any dividend payment from British Airways to IAG that exceeds 50 per cent of the pre-exceptional profit after tax in each 
financial year will require additional payments to be made to NAPS if the scheme is not at least 100 per cent funded. All dividend 
restrictions cease from 1 October 2025, onwards. British Airways must maintain a minimum cash level of €1,854 million (£1,600 
million) as at the date of the declaration of any dividends as well as immediately following the payment of any dividends to IAG and 
the associated matching contributions to NAPS. The amount of any deficit contributions and dividend matching contributions in a 
single financial year is limited to €348 million (£300 million).

Includes Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs), which the Trustees hold as assets to secure additional benefits on a defined contribution basis 
for those members who elect to make such AVCs. At 31 December 2023, such assets were €322 million (2022: €320 million) with a corresponding 
amount recorded in the scheme liabilities.

2 APS and NAPS have an accounting surplus under IAS 19, which would be available to the Group as a refund upon wind up of the scheme. This refund 
is restricted due to withholding taxes that would be payable by the Trustee arising on both the net pension asset and the future contractual minimum 
funding requirements. 

3 The net deferred tax asset recognised on the net employee benefit asset (2022: asset) was €48 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: €54 million). The 

defined benefit obligation includes €20 million (2022: €21 million) arising from unfunded plans.

i Investment strategies
For both APS and NAPS, the Trustee has ultimate responsibility for decision-making on investments matters, including the asset-
liability matching strategy. The latter is a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the 
movement in the projected benefit obligation over time. The Trustees’ investment committee adopts an annual business plan which 
sets out investment objectives and work required to support achievement of these objectives. The committee also deals with the 
monitoring of performance and activities, including work on developing the strategic benchmark to improve the risk return profile of 
the scheme where possible, as well as having a trigger-based dynamic governance process to be able to take advantage of 
opportunities as they arise. The investment committee reviews the existing investment restrictions, performance benchmarks and 
targets, as well as continuing to develop the de-risking and liability hedging portfolio.

Both schemes use derivative instruments for investment purposes and to manage exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, 
foreign exchange, longevity and liquidity risks arising in the normal course of business. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed 
through the use of Inflation-Linked Swap contracts. Foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into to mitigate the risk of 
currency fluctuations. Longevity risk is managed through the use of buy-in insurance contracts, asset swaps and longevity swaps. 

Along with existing contracts with Rothesay Life (as detailed in note 34c(iii)), APS is 90 per cent protected against all longevity risk 
and fully protected in relation to all pensions that were already being paid as at 31 March 2018. APS is nearly 90 per cent protected 
against interest rates and inflation (on a Retail Price Index basis). NAPS is 95 per cent protected against interest rates and inflation 
(on a Consumer Price Index basis).

The assets held by APS and NAPS are split between ‘return seeking assets’ and ‘liability matching assets’ depending on the maturity 
of each scheme. At 31 December 2023, the actual asset allocation for NAPS was 19 per cent (2022: 31 per cent) in return seeking 
assets and 81 per cent (2022: 69 per cent) in liability matching investments. For NAPS, the Trustee agreed an updated investment 
framework with British Airways as part of the Scheme’s 31 March 2021 actuarial valuation agreement. The Trustee aims towards an 
overall asset allocation with an agreed modest expected return relative to liabilities, and sufficient liquidity to manage investment 
risk appropriately on an on-going basis. The actual asset allocation for APS at 31 December 2023 was 1 per cent (2022: 1 per cent) in 
return seeking assets and 99 per cent (2022: 99 per cent) in liability matching investments. NAPS uses Liability Driven Investments 
(LDIs) to effectively hedge volatility in the scheme liabilities. This is achieved through direct bond holdings as opposed to the use of 
derivatives and as such leverage is low. Accordingly, as at 31 December 2023, NAPS has not been required to raise additional cash or 
liquidate existing assets in order to fund derivative positions.

The fair values of the Group’s scheme assets, which are not derived from quoted prices on active markets, are determined 
depending on the nature of the inputs used in determining the fair values (see note 30b for further details) and using the following 
methods and assumptions:

• private equities are valued at fair value based on the most recent transaction price or third-party net asset, revenue or earnings-

based valuations that generally result in the use of significant unobservable inputs. The dates of these valuations typically precede 
the reporting date and have been adjusted for any cash movements between the date of the valuation and the reporting date. 
Typically, the valuation approach and inputs for these investments are not updated through to the reporting date unless there are 
indications of significant market movements.

• properties are valued based on an analysis of recent market transactions supported by market knowledge derived from third-

party professional valuers that generally result in the use of significant unobservable inputs.

• alternative investments fair values, which predominantly include holdings in investment and infrastructure funds are determined 
based on the most recent available valuations applying the Net Asset Value methodology and issued by fund administrators or 
investment managers and adjusted for any cash movements having occurred from the date of the valuation to the reporting date. 
The dates of these valuations typically precede the reporting date and have been adjusted for any cash movements between the 
date of the valuation and the reporting date. Typically, the valuation approach and inputs for these investments are not updated 
through to the reporting date unless there are indications of significant market movements.

• other investments predominantly includes: interest receivable on bonds; dividends from listed and private equities that have been 
declared but not received at the balance sheet date; receivables from the sale of assets for which the proceeds have not been 
collected at the balance sheet date; and payables for the purchase of assets which have not been settled at the balance sheet 
date.

• derivative financial instruments are entered into predominantly to mitigate interest rate and inflation rate risks. These derivative 
financial instruments are stated at their fair value using pricing models and relevant market data as at the balance sheet date.

• asset and longevity swaps - APS has a contract with Rothesay Life, entered into in 2010 and extended in 2013, which covers 25 per 
cent (2022: 25 per cent) of the pensioner liabilities for an agreed list of members. Under the contract, to reduce the risk of long-
term longevity risk, Rothesay Life makes benefit payments monthly in respect of the agreed list of members in return for the 
contractual return receivable on a portfolio of assets (made up of quoted government debt) held by the scheme and the 
contractual payments made by APS to Rothesay Life on the longevity swaps. The Group holds the portfolio of assets at their fair 
value, with the government debt held at their quoted market price and the swaps accounted for at their estimated discounted 
future cash flows.

During 2011, APS entered into a longevity swap with Rothesay Life, which covers an additional 21 per cent (2022: 21 per cent) of 
the pensioner liabilities for the same agreed list of members as the 2010 contract. Under the longevity swap, to reduce the risk of 
long-term longevity risk, APS makes a fixed payment to Rothesay Life each month reflecting the prevailing mortality assumptions 
at the inception of the contract, and Rothesay Life make a monthly payment to APS reflecting the actual monthly benefit 
payments to members. The cash flows are settled net each month. If pensioners live longer than expected at inception of the 
longevity swap, Rothesay Life will make payments to the scheme to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners and if 
pensioners do not live as long as expected, then the scheme will make payments to Rothesay Life. The Group holds the longevity 
swap at fair value, determined at the estimated discounted future cash flows.

• insurance contract - During 2018 the Trustee of APS secured a buy-in contract with Legal & General. The buy-in contract covers all 
members in receipt of pensions from APS at 31 March 2018, excluding dependent children, receiving a pension at that date and 
members in receipt of equivalent pension only benefits, who were alive on 1 October 2018. Benefits coming into payment for 
retirements after 31 March 2018 are not covered. The contract covers benefits payable from 1 October 2018 onwards. The policy 
covers approximately 60 per cent of all benefits APS expects to pay out in future.

iv Effect of the asset ceiling
In measuring the valuation of the net defined benefit asset for each scheme, the Group limits such measurement to the lower of the 
surplus in each scheme and the respective asset ceiling. The asset ceiling represents the present value of the economic benefits 
available in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions after they are paid into the plan. The Group has determined 
that the recoverability of such surpluses, including minimum funding requirements, will be subject to withholding taxes in the UK, 
payable by the Trustee, of 35 per cent.

The future committed NAPS deficit contributions, as detailed in note 34a, are treated as minimum funding requirements under IAS 19 
and are not recognised as part of the scheme assets or liabilities. The Group has determined that upon the wind up of the scheme, 
that if the scheme is in surplus, including the incorporation of the minimum funding requirements, then the surplus will be available 
as a refund or a reduction in future contributions after they are paid into the scheme. The recovery of such amounts is subject to UK 
withholding tax payable by the Trustee. In measuring the recoverability of the surplus for each scheme, the Group limits such 
measurement to the lower of the surplus in each scheme and the respective asset ceiling. The asset ceiling represents the present 
value of the economic benefits available upon wind up of the scheme, less the application of withholding taxes in the UK, payable by 
the Trustee, at 35 per cent.

A reconciliation of the effect of the asset ceiling used in calculating the IAS 19 irrecoverable surplus in APS and NAPS is set out 
below:

On 22 November 2023, the UK Government announced that it intended to reduce the withholding tax payable upon winding up of 
pension schemes from 35 per cent to 25 per cent. While this change had not been substantively enacted at the reporting date and 
as such not reflected in the figures above, had the rate of withholding tax been reduced to 25 per cent at 31 December 2023, the 
effect would have been to reduce the effect of the asset ceiling by €210 million to €525 million, with a corresponding increase in the 
net employee benefit asset.

Included in the remeasurements from financial assumptions is an amount of €670 million (2022: increase of €10,299 million) that increases the 
scheme liabilities relating to changes in the discount rates and €356 million (2022: increase of €177 million) that reduces the scheme liabilities relating

1 Discount rate is determined by reference to the yield on high quality corporate bonds of currency and term consistent with the scheme liabilities.

2 Rate of increase in pensionable pay, which reflects inflationary increases, is assumed to be in line with increases in RPI.

3 It has been assumed that the rate of increase of pensions in payment, which reflects inflationary increases, will be in line with CPI for NAPS and RPI 

for APS as at 31 December 2023.

4 The rate of increase in healthcare costs for schemes based in the United States, which is based on medical trends, is assumed at 7.00 per cent 

grading down to 5.00 per cent over six years (2022: 6.25 per cent to 5.00 per cent over five years).

The current longevities underlying the values of the scheme liabilities were as follows:

For APS, the base mortality tables are based on the Agreed Valuation Basis (AVB) as agreed between British Airways and the 
trustees of APS. For NAPS, the base mortality tables are based on analysis undertaken for the purpose of the triennial valuation 
dated 31 March 2021. Future mortality improvements reflect the most recent model published by the UK actuarial profession’s 
Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI), being its 2022 model. These standard mortality tables, for both APS and NAPS, incorporate 
adjustments specific to the demographics of scheme members, including a long-term improvement parameter of 1.00 per cent per 
annum (2022: 1.00 per cent). 

For schemes in the United States, mortality rates were based on the MP-2021 mortality tables incorporating adjustments for the 
long-term impact COVID-19 is expected to have on mortality.

At 31 December 2023, the weighted-average duration of the defined benefit obligation was 9 years for APS (2022: 10 years) and 14 
years for NAPS (2022: 15 years). The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations was 2 to 16 years for other 
schemes (2022: 3 to 19 years). The weighted average duration represents a single figure for the average number of years over which 
the employee benefit liability discounted cash flows is extinguished and is highly dependent on movements in the aforementioned 
discount rates.

1 The 2022 reconciliation includes a reclassification of €7 million from the Settlement of derivative financial instruments to Interest paid to reflect the 

settlement loss arising on interest rate derivatives designated in hedge relationships. The reclassification of the settlement loss aligns with the 
classification within Net cash flows from operating activities in the Cash flow statement.

2 The 2022 reconciliation includes a reclassification to conform with the 2023 presentation, whereby, the 2028 convertible bond has been disclosed 
separately from the Bank, other loans and asset financed liabilities category. The reclassification resulted in an amount of €735 million and €605 
million being recorded within the 2028 convertible bond at 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2022, respectively.

37 Change in presentation of the Cash flow statement

During the course of 2023, the Group has made a number of changes to the presentation of its Cash flow statement. These changes 
have been applied retrospectively to the Cash flow statement and are detailed below.

Net gain on sale of property plant and equipment
Previously gains/losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment were recorded in the Income statement within Other non-
operating credits. Under the updated presentation, Net (gain)/loss on sale of property, plant and equipment is presented separately 
in the Income statement and included within Operating profit. Accordingly, operating profit included within Net cash flows from 
operating activities has been updated. See note 2 for further information.

Unrealised currency differences
Previously all unrealised foreign currency gains/losses arising in the Cash flow statement were recorded within Net foreign exchange 
differences. Under the updated presentation, Net foreign exchange differences has been amended to only include those unrealised 
currency differences arising from the retranslation of opening cash and cash equivalent balances, while unrealised currency 
differences arising from working capital used in operating activities are presented within Net cash flows from operating activities.

Other cash flows from operating activities
Previously movements in working capital balances were presented aggregated between working capital assets and working capital 
liabilities. Under the updated presentation working capital balances have been disaggregated by their nature to allow greater 
visibility as to the cash flow impacts associated with these balances. There has been no change in the overall total movement in 
working capital.

In addition, previously the Group presented the non-cash movements in provisions combined with other non-cash movements. 
Under the updated presentation these items have been separated into individual row items within the Cash flow statement.

38 Post balance sheet events

Revocation of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 in Spain
On 18 January 2024 the Tribunal Constitucional (Constitutional Court) in Spain, issued a ruling that a number of the amendments to 
corporate income tax arising from the introduction of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 were unconstitutional and accordingly revoked. The 
revocation of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 impacts the Groups operations as follows:

• Limitation of the use of historic tax losses

Prior to the introduction of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, the Spanish subsidiaries of the Group were permitted to offset up to 70 per 
cent of their taxable profit with historical accumulated tax losses (to the extent there were sufficient tax losses to do so). With the 
introduction of the Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, this limitation of tax losses applied to taxable profit was reduced to 25 per cent.

• Tax deductibility of impairments of investment in subsidiary undertakings

Where companies had impaired investments in subsidiaries prior to 2013 and deducted those impairments for tax purposes, Royal 
Decree-Law 3/2016 retrospectively required companies to reverse those impairment charges, for tax purposes, with the effect 
recognised equally over the five years commencing 1 January 2016.

The Group does not consider that the ruling by the Tribunal Constitucional constitutes an adjusting post-balance sheet event and 
accordingly the impact of these changes are not reflected in the financial statements. As at the date of these financial statements, 
there remains uncertainty as to how the revocation of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 will be applied and accordingly the methodology by 
which the Group, with its external tax advisors, quantifies the impacts of this revocation. Had the Group reflected the impact of 
ruling into the financial statements as at 31 December 2023, the impact would have been as follows:

• Current tax impact of historic loss limitation and deductibility of historic impairments of investments for fiscal years 2016 through 

2022
The Royal Decree Law 3/2016 restricted the use of prior year tax losses to 25 per cent of current year profits in the Group's 
Spanish companies. In addition, prior to 2013, Iberia impaired its subsidiary undertakings in Venezuela. Had the loss limitation been 
70 per cent and the historic impairment been tax deductible, the tax paid to the Spanish tax authorities, would have been up to 
approximately €83 million lower. The Group expects to record an associated current tax credit, with a corresponding receivable 
from the Spanish tax authorities. The Group is currently assessing the potential interest due, if any, from the Spanish tax authorities 
arising on this receivable.

• Current tax impact of loss limitation for fiscal year 2023

The Group measures current tax expense based on the regulations in effect as of the date when corporate income taxes are 
accrued. With the change in loss limitation, the Group anticipates the ability to offset up to 70 per cent of their Spanish taxable 
profits with prior-year losses for their 2023 Spanish taxes. If this limit had been applied at 31 December 2023 the Group foresees a 
reduction in the 2023 current tax expense of approximately €108 million.

• Deferred tax impact of future loss limitation

The Group measures deferred tax assets at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised. As detailed 
in note 2, the Group uses future cash flow projections over periods of up to ten years to determine the recoverability of deferred 
tax assets. With the change in loss limitation, the Group expects to be able to utilise more of its historical tax losses within this ten-
year period. Had the Royal Decree-Law 3/2016 not applied at 31 December 2023, the Group expects that the deferred tax assets 
of the Group, attributable to tax losses and tax credits, would have decreased by approximately €58 million, with a corresponding 
charge to Tax in the Income statement.

Notes to the accounts continuedAlternative performance measures

The performance of the Group is assessed using a number of alternative performance measures (APMs), some of which have been 
identified as key performance indicators of the Group. These measures are not defined under International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), should be considered in addition to IFRS measurements, may differ to definitions given by regulatory bodies 
applicable to the Group and may differ to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Further information on why these 
APMs are used is provided in the Key performance indicators section. They are used to measure the outcome of the Group’s 
strategy based on the Group’s strategic imperatives of: strengthening our core; driving earnings growth through asset-light 
businesses; and operating under a strengthened financial and sustainability framework.

During 2023, the Group has replaced the Levered free cash flow measure with the Free cash flow measure. The Free cash flow 
measure represents the cash generating ability of the Group to support operations and maintain its capital assets. This measure is 
monitored by the Group in making both investment and capital decisions. In addition, the Group has added an APM regarding the 
Ownership costs of the Group to enable a better understanding of how the capital assets of the Group contribute to the operating 
result in each reporting period. Other than the aforementioned change, the Group has made no changes to its pre-existing disclosures 
and treatments of APMs compared to those disclosed in the Annual report and accounts for the year to 31 December 2022.

The definition of each APM, together with a reconciliation to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.

a Profit after tax before exceptional items

Exceptional items are those that in the Board’s and management’s view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or 
incidence to supplement the understanding of the entity’s financial performance. The Management Committee of the Group uses 
financial performance on a pre-exceptional basis to evaluate operating performance and to make strategic, financial and operational 
decisions, and externally because it is widely used by security analysts and investors in evaluating the performance of the Group 
between reporting periods and against other companies.

While there have been no exceptional items recorded in the year to 31 December 2023, exceptional items in the year to 31 December 2022 
include: significant changes in the long-term fleet plans that result in the reversal of impairment of fleet assets and legal reimbursements.

Alternative performance measures continued

The rationale for each exceptional item is given below.

2 Partial reversal of historical fine

The exceptional credit of €23 million for the year to 31 December 2022 relates to the partial reversal of the fine, plus accrued interest, initially issued 
by the European Commission, in 2010, to British Airways regarding its involvement in cartel activity in the air cargo sector and that had been 
recognised as an exceptional charge. The exceptional credit has been recorded within Property, IT and other costs in the Income statement with no 
resultant tax charge arising. The cash inflow associated with the partial reversal of the fine was recognised during 2022.

3 Impairment reversal of fleet and associated assets

The exceptional impairment reversal of €8 million for the year to 31 December 2022 relates to six Airbus A320s in Vueling, previously stood down in 
the fourth quarter of 2020 and subsequently stood up in the second and third quarters of 2022. The exceptional impairment reversal was recorded 
within Right of use assets on the Balance sheet and within Depreciation, amortisation and impairment in the Income statement.

There is no cash flow impact and there has been a tax charge of €2 million on the recognition of the impairment reversal.

The table below provides a reconciliation of the statutory to pre-exceptional condensed alternative income statement by operating 
segment for the years to 31 December 2023 and 2022:

c Ownership costs

Ownership costs represents the income statement impact of the historical purchase of capital assets and is defined as depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment, arising on both property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and the net loss/(gain) on the 
sale of property, plant and equipment. The Group believes that this measure is useful to the users of the financial statements in 
understanding the impact of capital assets in deriving the operating result of the Group.

The Group monitors airline unit costs (per available seat kilometre (ASK), a standard airline measure of capacity) as a means of 
tracking operating efficiency of the core airline business. As fuel costs can vary with commodity prices, the Group monitors fuel and 
non-fuel costs individually. Within non-fuel costs are the costs associated with generating Other revenue, which typically do not 
represent the costs of transporting passengers or cargo and instead represent the costs of handling and maintenance for other 
airlines, non-flight products in BA Holidays and costs associated with other miscellaneous non-flight revenue streams. Airline non-
fuel costs per ASK is defined as total operating expenditure before exceptional items, less fuel, oil costs and emission charges and 
less non-flight specific costs divided by total available seat kilometres (ASKs), and is shown on a constant currency basis 
(abbreviated to ‘ccy’).

e Free cash flow (KPI)

Free cash flow represents the cash generated by the businesses and is defined as the net cash flows from operating activities taken 
from the Cash flow statement, less the cash flows associated with the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets reported in net cash flows from investing activities from the Cash flow statement. The Group believes that this measure is 
useful to the users of the financial statements in understanding the cash generating ability of the Group to support operations and 
maintain its capital assets.

To supplement total borrowings as presented in accordance with IFRS, the Group reviews net debt to EBITDA before exceptional 
items to assess its level of net debt in comparison to the underlying earnings generated by the Group in order to evaluate the 
underlying business performance of the Group. This measure is used to monitor the Group’s leverage and to assess financial 
headroom against internal and external security analyst and investor benchmarks.

Net debt is defined as long-term borrowings (both current and non-current), less cash, cash equivalents and current interest-bearing 
deposits. Net debt excludes supply chain financing arrangements which are classified within trade payables (note 23).

EBITDA before exceptional items is defined as operating result before exceptional items, interest, taxation, depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment.

users of the financial statements in helping them to see how the Group’s financial capacity has changed over the year. It is a measure 
of the profitability of the Group and of the core operating cash flows generated by the business model.

g Return on invested capital (KPI)

The Group monitors return on invested capital (RoIC) as it gives an indication of the Group’s capital efficiency relative to the capital 
invested, as well as the ability to fund growth and to pay dividends. RoIC is defined as EBITDA before exceptional items, less fleet 
depreciation adjusted for inflation, depreciation of other property, plant and equipment, and amortisation of software intangibles, 
divided by average invested capital and is expressed as a percentage.

Invested capital is defined as the average of property, plant and equipment and software intangible assets over a 12-month period 
between the opening and closing net book values. The fleet aspect of property, plant and equipment is inflated over the average age 
of the fleet to approximate the replacement cost of the associated assets.

h Results on a constant currency basis

Movements in foreign exchange rates impact the Group’s financial results. The IAG Board and Management Committee review the 
results, including revenue and operating costs at constant rates of exchange. These financial measures are calculated at constant 
rates of exchange based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year’s results of the Group. Although the 
Board and Management Committee do not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Board and 
Management Committee do believe that such results excluding the impact of currency fluctuations year-on-year provide additional 
useful information to investors regarding the Group’s operating performance on a constant currency basis. Accordingly, the financial 
measures at constant currency within the discussion of the Group Financial review should be read in conjunction with the 
information provided in the Group financial statements.

The following table represents the main average and closing exchange rates for the reporting periods. Where 2023 figures are stated 
at a constant currency basis, the 2022 rates stated below have been applied:

of the Group.

Liquidity is defined as Cash and cash equivalents plus Current interest-bearing deposits, plus Committed general undrawn facilities 
and Committed aircraft undrawn facilities.

Adjusted earnings per share

Airline non-fuel costs

Earnings are based on results before exceptional items after tax, adjusted for earnings 
attributable to equity holders and income statement impact of convertible bonds, divided by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for the dilutive impact of the assumed 
conversion of the bonds and employee share schemes outstanding

Total operating expenditure before exceptional items, less fuel, oil costs and emission charges 
and less non-flight specific costs. Within non-fuel costs are the costs associated with generating 
Other revenue, which typically do not represent the costs of transporting passengers or cargo 
and instead represent the costs of handling and maintenance for other airlines, non-flight 
products in BA Holidays and costs associated with other miscellaneous non-flight revenue 
streams. Shown on a constant currency basis

Airline non-fuel costs per ASK

Airline non-fuel costs divided by ASK

Available seat kilometres (ASK)

The number of seats available for sale multiplied by the distance flown

Available tonne kilometres (ATK) 

Block hours

The number of tonnes of capacity available for the carriage of load (passenger and cargo) 
multiplied by the distance flown

Hours of service for aircraft, measured from the time that the aircraft leaves the gate at the 
departure airport to the time that it arrives at the gate at the destination airport

Cargo revenue per CTK 

Cargo revenue divided by CTK

Cargo tonne kilometres (CTK) 

The number of tonnes of cargo carried that generate revenue (freight and mail) multiplied by the 
distance flown

Dividend cover 

EBITDA

Emissions Trading System (ETS)

Free cash flow

Gross capex

Interest cover 

Invested capital 

Liquidity

Net debt 

The number of times the result for the year covers the dividends paid and proposed

Emission Trading Systems are a market-based carbon pricing instrument that sets an explicit 
price on emissions. Group airlines participate in the EU, UK and Swiss Emission Trading Systems

Cash generated by the businesses, defined as the net cash flows from operating activities taken 
from the Cash flow statement, less the cash flows associated with the acquisition of property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets reported in net cash flows from investing activities 
from the Cash flow statement

Gross capital expenditure is the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets reported in the Group’s consolidated cash flow statement and includes fleet, customer 
product, IT, ETS allowances and infrastructure, including those assets initially purchased and 
then subject to subsequent sale and leaseback transactions and recognised as right of use assets

The number of times the profit/(loss) before taxation and exceptional items adding back net 
interest expense and interest income cover the net interest expense and interest income

The average of property, plant and equipment and software intangible assets over a 12-month 
period between the opening and closing net book values. The fleet aspect of property, plant and 
equipment is inflated over the average age of the fleet to approximate the replacement cost of 
the associated assets

Cash and cash equivalents plus Current interest-bearing deposits, plus committed general 
undrawn facilities and committed aircraft undrawn facilities

Current and long-term interest-bearing borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and current 
interest-bearing deposits

1 The options to purchase 100 Boeing 737 aircraft allow for flexibility in the choice of variant.

Aircraft are reported based on their contractual definitions as opposed to their accounting determination. For accounting purposes, while all operating 
leases are presented as lease liabilities, finance leases are presented as either lease liabilities or asset financed liabilities, depending on the nature of the 
individual arrangement. See note 2 in the Group financial statements for further information.

As well as those aircraft in service the Group also holds 9 aircraft (31 December 2022: 18) not in service.

Certain statements included in this report are forward-looking. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate 
only to historical or current facts. By their nature, they involve risk and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on 
circumstances that will occur in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-
looking statements.

Forward-looking statements often use words such as “expects”, “believes”, “may”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “continues”, “intends”, 
“plans”, “targets”, “predicts”, “estimates”, “envisages” or “anticipates” or other words of similar meaning or their negatives. They 
include, without limitation, any and all projections relating to the results of operations and financial conditions of International 
Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. and its subsidiary undertakings from time to time (the ‘Group’), as well as plans and objectives for 
future operations, expected future revenues, financing plans, expected expenditure, acquisitions and divestments relating to the 
Group and discussions of the Group’s business plans, and its assumptions, expectations, objectives and resilience with respect to 
climate scenarios. All forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information known to the Group on the date of this 
report and speak as of the date of this report. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations, the Group does not 
undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which 
any such statement is based.

Actual results may differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements in this report as a result of any number 
of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, economic and geo-political, market, 
regulatory, climate, supply chain or other significant external events, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond 
the control of the Group, and it is not reasonably possible to itemise each item. Accordingly, readers of this report are cautioned 
against relying on forward-looking statements. Further information on the primary risks of the business and the Group’s risk 
management process is set out in the Risk management and principal risk factors section in this report. All forward-looking 
statements made on or after the date of this report and attributable to IAG are expressly qualified in their entirety by the primary
