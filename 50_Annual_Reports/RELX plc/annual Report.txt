items related to acquisitions and disposals, and the associated deferred tax movements. Reconciliations between the reported and adjusted figures are set out on pages 222 to 
230. Underlying growth rates are calculated at constant currency, excluding the results of acquisitions until 12 months after purchase, and excluding the results of disposals 
and assets held for sale. Underlying revenue growth rates also exclude exhibition cycling. Constant currency growth rates are based on 2022 full-year average and hedge 
exchange rates.

The shares of RELX PLC are traded on the London, Amsterdam and New York stock exchanges. RELX PLC and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are together

known as ‘RELX’.

RELX had another year of strong growth 
in 2023 as it continues to execute well on its 
strategic priorities. As RELX has continued 
to execute its strategy, it has also delivered 
strong shareholder returns and received 
external recognition for its Corporate 
Responsibility performance.

Paul Walker, Chair

RELX had another year of strong growth in 2023 as the company 
continues to execute well on its strategic priorities. I am particularly 
pleased that all business areas have performed strongly. 
Underlying revenue growth was 8%, with underlying adjusted 
operating profit growth of 13%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 
11%  at constant currency to 114.0p (102.2p). Reported earnings per 
share were 94.1p (85.2p). As RELX has continued to execute its 
strategy, it has also delivered strong shareholder returns. In the 
decade to the end of 2023, RELX has delivered Total Shareholder 
Returns of 347%, compared with 67% for the FTSE100 over the 
same period.

Culture and Employee Engagement
RELX places significant emphasis on the way we do business and 
on acting with integrity and in accordance with the highest ethical 
standards. Our commitment is set out in our statement on Purpose, 
strategy, values and culture on page 116 of this report and we strive 
to ensure decisions taken are aligned with RELX’s values. We 
also believe maintaining high levels of employee engagement 
is an important driver of growth in the business. The Board draws 
insights about culture and employee engagement from a range 
of sources including annual employee opinion surveys and the 
activities of our dedicated Non-Executive Director responsible 
for employee engagement, which facilitate a direct link with the 
Board and allow it to further understand and consider the views 
of employees. Employee engagement scores from the annual 
survey remained at very high levels.

Dividends
In recognition of our strong performance and outlook for the 
company we are proposing an 8% increase in the full year dividend 
of 58.8p (54.6p).

Balance sheet
Net debt was £6.4bn at 31 December 2023. Net debt/EBITDA 
including pensions was 2.0x, compared with 2.1x in 2022. 
Capital expenditure represented 5% of revenues.

Share buybacks
We deployed £800m on share buybacks in 2023. In recognition of 
our strong financial position and cash flow we intend to deploy a 
total of £1,000m on share buybacks in 2024, of which £150m has 
already been completed.

The Board
At the 2023 Annual General Meeting, Wolfhart Hauser, the Senior 
Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
retired from the Board having served since 2013, and Alistair Cox 

was appointed a Non-Executive Director. Alistair served as Chief 
Executive of Hays from 2007 until 2023, and Chief Executive of Xansa 
from 2002 to 2007. He was formerly a Non-Executive Director of Just 
Eat and 3i. Suzanne Wood became Senior Independent Director and 
Robert MacLeod became Chair of the Remuneration Committee.

Marike van Lier Lels, who has been on the Board since 2015, will be 
stepping down as a Non-Executive Director after the Annual General 
Meeting. Bianca Tetteroo will become a Non-Executive Director from 
July 2024, subject to her election by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting. Bianca is Chief Executive and Chair of the Executive 
Board of Achmea, a leading Netherlands-based financial services 
organisation, a role she has held since 2021. She previously spent 
13 years with Fortis Group.

I would like to thank Wolfhart and Marike for their support and 
advice. I am delighted to welcome Alistair to the Board and look 
forward to Bianca joining us.

Remuneration Policy
In 2023, following an in-depth review, the Board presented 
an updated Directors’ Remuneration Policy for shareholder 
consideration. The updated policy received strong support 
from shareholders.

Governance
RELX maintains a strong corporate governance framework and 
believes doing so is critical to achieving long-term, sustainable 
growth. Corporate Responsibility remains a priority for RELX. During 
the year, the Board reviewed the company’s Corporate Responsibility 
activities, including progress on RELX’s unique contributions to 
society as well as its Corporate Responsibility governance, people, 
customers, community, supply chain and environment.

Our performance was again recognised by external agencies: RELX 
achieved a AAA MSCI Environmental, Social and Governance rating 
for an eighth consecutive year; was ranked second in our sector by 
Sustainalytics; maintained fifth place in the Responsibility100 Index, 
and was a constituent of the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for 
the fifth consecutive year.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank RELX employees for their 
many contributions throughout 2023. I am confident that with their 
knowledge and commitment, RELX will continue to be successful 
in the year ahead.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Overview

Chief Executive Officer’s report

RELX delivered strong revenue and profit 
growth in 2023, driven by the ongoing shift in 
business mix towards higher growth 
information-based analytics and decision 
tools that deliver enhanced value to our 
customers across market segments

Erik Engstrom, Chief Executive Officer

Recognising that across RELX we have products, services, tools 
and events that advance the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG), we continued to expand the free RELX 
SDG Resource Centre contributing to a 21% increase in content.

We further improved on our key Corporate Responsibility 
performance metrics. We advanced inclusion and belonging, 
including through our Women in Tech Mentoring programme; 
rolled-out the RELX Responsible Artificial Intelligence Principles 
across the business; increased the number of suppliers that 
signed our Supplier Code of Conduct; and continued to ensure all 
of our electricity came from renewable sources and renewable 
energy certificates, while reducing our Scope 1 and 2 carbon 
emissions.

2024 Outlook
We continue to see positive momentum across the group, and we 
expect another year of strong underlying growth in revenue and 
adjusted operating profit, as well as strong growth in adjusted 
earnings per share on a constant currency basis.

Erik Engstrom
Chief Executive Officer

2023 progress
RELX delivered strong revenue and profit growth in 2023, 
driven by the ongoing shift in business mix towards higher 
growth information-based analytics and decision tools 
that deliver enhanced value to our customers across 
market segments.

We have been able to develop and deploy these tools across 
the company for well over a decade by leveraging deep customer 
understanding to combine leading content and data sets with 
powerful technologies. We are confident that our ability to 
leverage artificial intelligence and other technologies, as they 
evolve, will continue to be an important driver of customer 
value and growth in our business for many years to come.

Electronic revenue, representing 83% of the total grew 7%, 
with strong growth in face-to-face activity more than offsetting 
the print decline, bringing the overall group underlying revenue 
growth rate to 8%. Underlying adjusted operating profit grew 
13%. Our strategy of driving continuous process innovation to 
manage cost growth below revenue growth, together with the 
recovery in face-to-face activity, resulted in an improvement in 
the group adjusted operating margin to 33.1% compared with 
31.4% in 2022.

Corporate responsibility
We performed well on our Corporate Responsibility priorities in 
2023, on our unique contributions to society, and on our key 
metrics. Our unique contributions are where we make a positive 
impact on society in the conduct of our business, encompassing 
protection of society, advancing science and health, promotion of 
the rule of law and access to justice, and fostering communities.

Chief Executive Officer’s report

RELX business overview

RELX strategy

Our strategic direction is unchanged. Our objective is to help our customers make better decisions, get better results and be more 
productive. We do this by leveraging deep customer understanding to combine leading content and data sets with powerful technologies 
in global platforms to build increasingly sophisticated information-based analytics and decision tools that deliver enhanced value to 
professional and business customers across market segments.

We aim to build leading positions in long-term global growth markets and leverage our skills, assets and resources across RELX, 
both to build solutions for our customers and to pursue cost efficiencies.

We are systematically migrating all of our information solutions across RELX towards higher value-add decision tools, adding broader 
data sets, embedding more sophisticated analytics and leveraging more powerful technology, primarily through organic development.

We are supplementing this organic development with selective acquisitions of targeted data sets and analytics, and assets in 
high-growth markets that support our organic growth strategies and are natural additions to our existing businesses.

Our improving long-term growth trajectory is being driven by the ongoing shift in our business mix towards higher growth analytics 
and decision tools. When combined with our strategy of driving continuous process innovation to manage cost growth below revenue 
growth, the result is continued strong earnings growth, with improving returns.

RELX business model

RELX is a global provider of information-based analytics and decision tools for professional and business customers.

These products are generally sold through dedicated sales forces direct to customers and are priced on a subscription or transactional 
basis, often under multi-year contracts, and are predominantly delivered in electronic format.

Our products often account for less than 1% of our customers’ total cost base but can have a significant and positive impact on the 
economics of the remaining 99%. Our objective is to continue to enhance the value that we deliver to our customers and over time to grow 
our own total cost base below our rate of revenue growth on an underlying basis.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Overview

Key performance indicators

RELX’s key performance indicators (KPIs) track progress against long-term priorities. At the group level, given the diverse nature of our 
end markets, we look at the continued migration of the business towards electronic delivery, the increasing introduction of electronic 
decision tools, group level financial metrics, and corporate responsibility and sustainability metrics. The executive directors’ remuneration 
policy includes measures linked to financial and corporate responsibility KPIs and may also include other non-financial metrics (see pages 
128 to 148 for details). In addition, we track KPIs within each market segment, at the product level, relevant to the performance of the 
specific business areas. Significant group financial and corporate responsibility KPIs are set out below. Additional corporate responsibility 
and sustainability performance metrics and targets are set out on pages 39 to 90 in the Corporate Responsibility section.

RELX uses adjusted and underlying figures as additional performance measures. Adjusted figures primarily exclude the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and other 
items related to acquisitions and disposals, and the associated deferred tax movements. Reconciliations between the reported and adjusted figures are set out on pages 222 
to 230. Underlying growth rates are calculated at constant currency, excluding the results of acquisitions until 12 months after purchase, and excluding the results of disposals 
and assets held for sale. Underlying revenue growth rates also exclude exhibition cycling. Constant currency growth rates are based on 2022 full-year average and hedge 
exchange rates.

Technology at RELX involves creating actionable insights from big data – large volumes 
of data in different formats being ingested at high speeds.

We take this high-quality data from thousands of sources in 
varying formats – both structured and unstructured. We then 
extract the data points from the content, link the data points and 
enrich them to make it analysable. Finally, we apply advanced 
algorithms such as machine learning and natural language 
processing to provide professional customers with the 
actionable insights they need to do their jobs, for example, 
in the form of extractive AI insights to help them make speedy 
and accurate decisions, or generative AI output to reduce or 
automate their workload. That could be a university 
benchmarking its performance; a doctor deciding the best way 
to treat a patient; a litigator assessing whether to take a case 
to court; a retailer deciding if a transaction is genuine; or an 
insurance underwriter assessing the likelihood of a claim.

Technology is a key enabler at RELX and we leverage our 
resources, capabilities and infrastructure across the 
organisation. We are continually building new products and 
data and technology platforms, re-using approaches and 
technologies across the company to create platforms that are 
reliable, scalable and secure. Even though we serve different 
segments with different content sets, the nature of the 
problems solved and the way we apply technology has 
commonalities across the company. We also leverage 
technology to improve operational efficiencies.

Harnessing technology: 
LexisNexis Total Property Understanding

An AI-driven property intelligence solution that enables US home 
insurance companies to better manage and evaluate risk.

About Total Property Understanding:

The LexisNexis Total Property Understanding solution 
provides US home insurance companies with a comprehensive 
solution to identify risk across their books of business while 
capturing interior, exterior, and aerial data about those risks 
to make more informed underwriting decisions. Core to the 
solution is LexisNexis Flyreel, an AI-driven property survey 
solution that guides home and business owners through their 
own property assessment.

Property insurers had been experiencing 
significant claims losses due to a rise 
in catastrophic events and increasing costs of 
repairing damages. These claims losses have 
outpaced the rise in insurance premiums.

When underwriting a new policy, insurance companies rely 
on a manual and cost intensive process and in attempts to 
manage their profit, they’re selective on where they perform 
inspections. Between 10 to 20 percent of homes are typically 
inspected when underwriting a new policy with even fewer being 
inspected when a policy is renewed. These inspections don’t 
always capture the property characteristics that insurers need 
to properly assess risk. This means insurance companies often 
don’t have a good understanding of the risk across their book of 
business. LexisNexis Risk Solutions is addressing this challenge 
through the combination of data and artificial intelligence.

LexisNexis Risk Solutions aggregates significant intelligence 
on a property’s building characteristics, claims history and 
ownership. It supplements this with aerial imagery, which 
helps it better understand a property’s footprint and condition, 
particularly the roof condition, which is often an area of large 
claims losses. With the acquisition of Flyreel, it has added a 
detailed understanding of risks within the property and on the 
home’s exterior. Leveraging advanced analytics, it can now 
score the risk of a property for an insurance company as it is 
underwriting a new policy, as well as help them analyse risks 
within their existing book of business.

Total Property Understanding is an end-to-end AI powered 
workflow that enables insurance companies to select the 
properties they should invest time and resources into 
inspecting. It captures data on these properties at scale with 
an artificial intelligence assistant that provides the insured with 
step-by-step instructions through a friendly and intuitive user 
experience, guiding them through a process of capturing video 
and imagery of their property for underwriting analysis.

The AI amplifies the abilities of the underwriters by automatically 
flagging risks as well as potential hazards in their inspections, 
enabling them to act on this data more efficiently at scale.

 94%

Homeowner satisfaction rate when using the mobile 
AI assistant

The US property insurance market has seen 
record underwriting losses in recent years, 
and the need to capture and analyse 
ground-level data to understand, segment and 
manage risk has never been greater. By using 
the best of today’s technology, our AI-driven 
solution unlocks new opportunities for 
property insurers to deliver world-class 
experiences to policyholders while acting as 
a force multiplier, enabling underwriters to 
capture more comprehensive data while acting 
on that data more efficiently than before.

Cole Winans
VP & GM Home Insurance, LexisNexis Risk Solutions

LexisNexis Risk Solutions has developed proprietary computer 
vision models that automatically detect over 200 property 
attributes to improve the underwriting process and risk 
management altogether. The mobile AI assistant guides 
homeowners through comprehensive scans of the property 
with advanced computer vision capabilities. The AI automatically 
identifies materials, condition, risks and hazards. It even has the 
capability of servicing risk and recall information for appliances 
that often cause losses like hot water heaters and refrigerators, 
washing machines, as well as recalled circuit breakers that can 
lead to deadly house fires. On the exterior, it identifies trees that 
pose a risk to the roof, analyses the condition of shingles to 
determine whether they’re curling and could lead to a leak.

The homeowner’s experience when using the mobile AI assistant 
is simple and intuitive, with a 94 percent homeowner satisfaction 
rate and above 70 percent completion for customers who are 
adopting our best practices. While it is not a market requirement, 
LexisNexis Risk Solutions also took the initiative to develop its 
own proprietary and patented method for face blurring in case 
individuals and children appear in the footage.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Overview

Harnessing technology: 
Lexis+ AI

A generative AI solution designed to transform legal work.

New solution delivers linked hallucination-free legal 
citations and provides the highest levels of security 
and privacy

This is a moment unlike any we’ve seen in the 
legal industry, delivering generative AI that 
will safely and securely accelerate our 
customers’ success. Lexis+ AI gives legal 
professionals a significant competitive 
advantage by driving improved speed, 
productivity, and work quality gains 
for law firms and their clients.

Sean Fitzpatrick
CEO of LexisNexis North America, UK, and Ireland

As such, the company has adopted a flexible, multi-model 
approach, using the best model for the best use case. This 
approach includes Anthropic’s Claude 2, hosted on Amazon 
Bedrock from Amazon Web Services (AWS), OpenAI’s GPT-4 
hosted on Microsoft Azure, and others.

Customers indicate that security and privacy are among the 
highest barriers to generative AI adoption. Lexis+ AI offers 
industry-leading data security and attention to privacy. LexisNexis 
leverages ‘privacy by design’ practices in Lexis+ AI to ensure that 
customer activity and model interactions are limited to the 
individual and are not used to train the model.

LexisNexis is responsibly developing legal AI solutions with 
human oversight. The deployment of Lexis+ AI is guided by the 
RELX Responsible AI Principles, considering the real-world 
impact of its solutions on people and taking action to prevent 
the creation or reinforcement of unfair bias.

About Lexis+ AI:

Lexis+ AI is a generative AI solution designed to transform legal 
work, featuring conversational search, intelligent legal drafting, 
insightful summarisation, and document upload and analysis 
capabilities. The solution is supported by state-of-the-art 
encryption and privacy technology to keep sensitive data secure.

Lexis+ AI delivers trusted and comprehensive legal results with 
linked hallucination-free legal citations that combine the power 
of generative AI with proprietary LexisNexis search technology, 
Shepard’s Citations functionality, and authoritative content. 
Lexis+ AI answers are grounded in one of the world’s largest 
repositories of accurate and exclusive legal content from 
LexisNexis, minimising the risk of invented content 
or hallucinations, and checking all citations against Shepard’s, 
a powerful legal citation tool to ensure citation validation.

Lexis+ AI has been developed with commercial preview users 
from leading global law firms, corporate legal departments,  
US small law firms, and US courts, and the company plans to 
expand its commercial preview program to legal professionals  
in Canada, the UK, France and Australia in 2024.

LexisNexis Legal & Professional has been a 
long-time leader in deploying AI technologies 
to the legal market to improve productivity, 
efficiency, and the overall business and 
practice of law.

LexisNexis Legal & Professional’s first-hand experience 
using AI language models dates back to 2018 with Google BERT. 
Over the past ten years, the company has spent over $1bn 
investing in technology. Today, LexisNexis is working directly 
with Large Language Model (LLM) creators and trusted cloud 
providers to develop faster, more accurate, transparent,  
and secure generative AI offerings.

Traditional Large Language Models have often struggled with 
legal use cases. The content supporting the models can be 
dated, lack citation authority, and be prone to factual and 
conceptual hallucinations.

Lexis+ AI excels at transforming legal work because it uses 
subject matter experts – attorneys – to fine-tune models for 
specific legal use cases; prompt engineering that analyses a 
customer’s question and provides additional instructions to 
improve the model; and integrates vast amounts of caselaw, 
legal data, news and other content capabilities using 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend the capability 
of a model. Thanks to its high-quality content and pristine data, 
LexisNexis Legal & Professional is uniquely positioned to 
partner with LLM creators to jointly develop models for 
legal industry use.

Scopus AI has been tested with more than 16,000 
researchers during its development

Researchers need to understand unfamiliar 
topics, often with little time to do so. We are 
combining generative AI with our trusted 
and vetted content, data and domain expertise 
to help them in their critical work. Elsevier 
has been committed to working with the 
community and using AI responsibly for many 
years, from creating quality data-led insights 
to support decision making in research, to 
helping our customers assess the risks of 
potential new drug treatments. This is an 
important next step as we build more 
sophisticated solutions that will support  
our customers in the future.

Maxim Khan
Senior Vice President of Analytics Products 
and Data Platform, Elsevier

About Scopus AI:

Scopus AI is a next-generation tool that combines Elsevier’s 
Scopus, an expertly curated abstract and citation database 
of peer reviewed research, with responsible AI to help 
researchers discover global knowledge in all fields. Scopus 
brings together content from over 29,000 journals from more 
than 7,000 publishers worldwide, with over 2.4bn citations, 
and over 19m research author profiles.

Researchers, especially those early in 
their careers and those working across 
disciplines face significant challenges and 
complexity in their daily work, including an 
ever-growing volume of data, prevalent 
misinformation and increasing workloads.

Scopus AI helps them understand and explore a particular topic 
quickly, make connections across disciplines and collaborate 
with others to ensure the research has greater academic and 
societal impact.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the world’s 
imagination with their ability to generate content, but they 
also have shortcomings such as lack of transparency and 
hallucinations which can undermine trust in the results delivered.

Scopus AI provides easy to read digestible summaries, with 
links to research papers and the ability to go deeper in seconds. 
Notably, our advanced prompt engineering limits the risk of 
hallucinations by grounding content generation in trusted and 
verified Scopus content, the world’s largest data base of curated 
scientific literature.

Content is rigorously vetted and selected by an independent 
review board of 17 world-renowned scientists, researchers 
and librarians who represent the major scientific disciplines.

Scopus AI uses OpenAI’s GPT and other LLM technology in 
combination with Elsevier’s own technologies. It uses fine-tuned 
mini language models for vectorising abstracts and is hosted on 
Azure. Its front end is built with a mix of JavaScript and CSS, 
while Python, Java, Elasticsearch and Langchain are utilised 
in the backend.

Customer-driven innovation is core to Elsevier’s research and 
product development to ensure our solutions help them achieve 
their goals. Ahead of its full launch in January 2024, Scopus AI 
has been tested by and benefits from the feedback of thousands 
of researchers globally. Their feedback has reinforced that 
researchers want trustworthy, cited information that is relevant 
and highly personalised.

Insurance, representing just under 40% of revenue, provides 
comprehensive data, analytics and decision tools for personal 
auto and home, commercial and life insurance carriers to improve 
critical aspects of their business. Information solutions help 
insurers assess risks, improve customer experience, increase 
efficiency in pricing and underwriting insurance policies, and 
settle claims in the US and other key markets. Industry-leading 
products provide real-time information on policy holders, 
identify insurance coverage details and lapses in coverage, 
and give insurers access to vehicle and behaviour-centric data, 
standardised across automakers for the underwriting and claims 
processes. Innovative decision tools seamlessly integrate into 
an insurer’s workflow and are delivered through a single point 
of access within an insurer’s infrastructure.

Insurance solutions drive more consistency and efficiency 
in claims, providing data and decisions for challenging total 
losses at first notice of loss and throughout the claim life cycle. 
Insurance solutions provide comprehensive interior, exterior and 
aerial data for home insurers and offers AI-enabled insights 
to fast-track decision making for new business or renewal 
underwriting and claims processes. Life insurers use predictive 
models, public and motor vehicle records to better understand 
mortality risk and make life insurance more accessible. In 2023 
we acquired Human API, a provider of consumer-driven health 
data via a proprietary platform, enabling more efficient 
underwriting processes for life insurers.

Specialised Industry Data Services, representing just over 10% 
of revenue, provides critical business intelligence, data, software 
and analytics solutions to professionals in many of the world’s 
largest industries. These solutions include: ICIS, an independent 
source of data and intelligence for the global commodities and 
chemicals markets; Cirium, the aviation analytics company; 
XpertHR, a compliance, benchmarking and pay-equity data 
and analytics business driving global HR topics; and Nextens, 
a provider of workflow solutions, content and analytics for 
tax professionals.

Government, representing just over 5% of revenue, has helped 
US agencies shift from identity verification to authentication 
to confront fraud, waste, and abuse. Front-end identity 
authentication is central to how the government dispenses 
hundreds of billions of dollars in entitlements, stimulus, 
benefits and contracts to people and businesses.

Our solution synthesises thousands of data sources and billions 
of relationships into modernised interfaces, providing agencies 
immediate access to identity and authentication analytics. 
It allows recipients fast and secure access to critical government 
benefit programmes through near-frictionless identity 
verification and authentication for everything from unemployment 
insurance claims and remote government workforce access to 
matching of patient data, providing a snapshot in time for public 
health researchers.

Market opportunities
We operate in markets with strong long-term growth in demand 
for high-quality advanced analytics based on industry information 
and insight, including: financial crime compliance; business risk; 
fraud and identity solutions; due diligence requirements 
surrounding customer enrolment; security and privacy 
considerations; insurance underwriting transactions; insurance 
acquisition, retention and claims handling; data and advanced 
analytics for the banking, commodities and chemicals, aviation 
and human resources sectors; and tax and public benefits fraud.

Expansion of mobile and digital use cases and the growing mix 
of consumer payment options continue to drive opportunity for 
Business Services solutions that drive efficiency in risk decision 
making. As criminals continuously adjust attack vectors targeting 
financial transactions, organisations are utilising our solutions 
to evolve their fraud detection and prevention, financial crime, 
compliance and consumer and business credit programmes.

initiatives, and heightened regulatory scrutiny also provide 
growth opportunities. We are seeing new use cases for our 
solutions emerge for corporations, e-commerce, travel, gaming/
gambling, telecommunications, trade compliance and new 
alternative digital payment methods such as digital wallet 
applications and Buy Now, Pay Later, particularly mule account 
setup detection. Continued rapid digitalisation of emerging 
markets provides growth opportunity for fraud and identity in 
digital channels. We are also seeing revived demand in third-party 
collections and non-prime lending.

In Insurance, growth is supported by customer experience 
advances in the auto, home, commercial and life insurance 
markets, and the increasing adoption by insurance carriers 
of more sophisticated data and analytics in the prospecting, 
underwriting and claims evaluation processes, to assess risk, 
increase competitiveness, improve operating cost efficiency 
and address profitability challenges.

Transactional activity is driven by growth in insurance quoting and 
policy switching, as consumers seek better policy terms. This 
activity is stimulated by competition among insurance companies, 
increased loss ratios and consumer interest in insurance internet 
quoting and policy binding. We see opportunities across the 
insurance continuum using data and analytics to play a critical role 
in assisting the insurer and consumer decision-making process, 
this helps consumers and businesses transact with insurers 
throughout the policy life cycle.

We deliver solutions that bridge insurers and automakers, 
utilising connectivity and data from connected cars to insert 
vehicle data into insurer workflows and empower consumers 
with a deeper understanding of driving behaviour. Our deepening 
relationships with automakers reflect the need to improve 
and digitise the consumer experience through ownership 
management and connected services solutions, while creating 
efficiencies within automakers’ operations.

In Specialised Industry Data Services, growth in the global 
commodities and chemicals markets is led by changing trade 
patterns, a drive to embrace sustainability and demand for more 
sophisticated supply chain solutions to better utilise precious 
resources. The recovery of the aviation industry post pandemic 
has led to a focus on digital transformation, to drive more efficient, 

effective and profitable business models in businesses such as 
airlines, with a particularly strong focus on CO2 emissions data 
and ESG reporting. The rapidly changing workforce environment 
is driving employers to better utilise data and analytics to attract, 
retain and develop a diverse workforce which is further 
accelerating growth in human resource management.

With over 7,500 federal, state and local agencies using our 
services, the Government business continues its mission of 
preventing fraud, fighting crime, reducing risk, and providing 
citizens with immediate, equitable access to government systems. 
The Cares Act increased the demand for online access to 
government services and highlighted the need for robust fraud 
prevention tools as criminals continued to compromise these 
systems, leveraging both online and mobile access technologies. 
This problem has proven to be pronounced and sophisticated 
as government investigations into improper payments have 
increased. Data integrity and fraud prevention for businesses 
and people play an increasingly important role in accessing 
government services and receiving entitlements as agencies 
continue to adopt private sector technologies. The level and 
timing of demand in this market is influenced by government 
funding and revenue considerations.

Strategic priorities
Our strategic goals are anchored in helping customers achieve 
better business outcomes utilising greater insight into the risks 
and opportunities associated with individuals, businesses, 
devices and transactions. We provide data and decision tools to 
help customers understand their markets, manage risks and 
control costs. We enable this by focusing on: delivering innovative 
products; expanding our more established risk management 
solutions across adjacent markets; addressing international 
opportunities to meet local needs; expanding our analytics 
capabilities; and investing in technology to complement 
organic innovation.

LexisNexis Risk Solutions has been developing AI and ML 
techniques for a number of years to generate actionable insights 
that help our customers make accurate, better informed and 
more timely decisions. The successful deployment of AI and ML 
techniques starts with a deep understanding of customer needs 
and leverages the breadth and depth of our data sets, coupled with 
the expertise and domain knowledge to discern which AI/ML 
algorithm to use, in what context, to solve our customers’ 
business problems most effectively.

Business model, distribution channels and competition
We sell our products direct-to-client, priced either on a 
subscription or transactional with volumetric element basis. 
We also utilise a robust partner distribution channel.

Principal competitors in Business Services include data and 
analytics companies such as the major credit bureaux, which 
in many cases address various capabilities within each solution 
offering. In Insurance, data and analytics competitors such 
as Verisk sell solutions to insurance carriers but largely 
address different activities to ours. Principal competitors in the 
Government segment include data providers such as the major 
credit bureaux. Specialised Industry Data Services competes with 
a number of information providers on a service by service basis 
including S&P Global Platts and Thomson Reuters as well as 
a number of niche and privately owned competitors.

Strong fundamentals continuing to drive underlying 
revenue growth
Underlying revenue growth of +8% continues to be driven by our 
deeply embedded analytics and decision tools across segments. 

Underlying adjusted operating profit growth was +9%, with 
a small increase in adjusted operating margin after 
portfolio effects. 

In Business Services, which represents around 45% of 
divisional revenue, growth continued to be driven by Financial 
Crime Compliance and digital Fraud & Identity solutions, with 
new sales strengthening in the second half of the year. 

In Insurance, which represents just under 40% of divisional 
revenue, strong growth reflected the further extension of 
solution sets across insurance markets, continued new 
sales momentum, and positive market factors.

Specialised Industry Data Services, which represents just 
over 10% of divisional revenue, delivered strong growth, led 
by Commodity Intelligence and Aviation.

In Government, growth continued to be driven by the 
development and roll-out of analytics and decision tools.

2024 outlook
We expect continued strong underlying revenue growth with 
underlying adjusted operating profit growth slightly exceeding

How alternative data 

unlocks the doors to

About LexisNexis 

Risk Solutions:

LexisNexis Risk Solutions is a global 

provider of information-based 

analytics and decision tools for 

professional and business customers. 

It harnesses the power of data, 

sophisticated analytics platforms and 

technology solutions to provide 

insights that help businesses and 

governmental entities reduce risk and 

improve decisions to benefit people 

around the globe. Its LexisNexis 

RiskView Credit Solutions products 

enable more unbanked and 

underserved consumers to gain 

broader access to traditional 

credit and financial products.

Habitat for Humanity was founded 
in 1976 and is a global nonprofit 
housing organisation working in local 
communities across all 50 states in the 
US and in more than 70 countries. 
Families in need of decent, affordable 
housing apply for homeownership 
with their local Habitat for Humanity. 
Its homeowners help build their own 
homes alongside volunteers and pay 
an affordable mortgage.

Most banks assess a consumer’s lending risk by using a 
traditional credit score, which relies on a consumer’s debt 
repayment history and total amount of debt. A good score 
is required for consumers to access mainstream financial 
products and services, including home mortgages, car 
loans and credit cards.

Without a strong FICO score, consumers face difficulties in 
obtaining these financial services and often resort to payday 
lenders and other high-interest credit sources for short-term 
funds. Habitat for Humanity sought to move beyond traditional 
credit scores to identify consumers it could provide loans to at 
affordable rates.

LexisNexis RiskView uses non-credit events to assess a 
consumer’s stability, asset profile and numerous non-
derogatory data signals, such as education history, personal 
property ownership and professional licence data. It provides 
lenders, such as Habitat for Humanity, an alternative method 
for evaluating loan affordability and the likelihood of debt 
repayment. Consequently, they can expand their customer 
base safely, while consumers gain access to more affordable 
and dependable credit.

Jalynnka Harris, a single mother of two working as a packing 
instructor in Indianapolis, approached Habitat for Humanity 
to help purchase a home for her family after repeated rent 
increases for their apartment. Despite having a steady job, 
no outstanding debts and a college degree, she lacked a credit 
rating because she had paid for everything she owned in cash 
or by cheque. Habitat for Humanity used alternative data from 
LexisNexis Risk Solutions to take a holistic view of Harris’ 
credit risk and approved her for a mortgage of approximately 
$500 per month over 20 years, which was less than her previous 
rent payments.

We look more holistically at their 
entire credit profile: Their ability 
to pay, their willingness to partner, 
versus just looking at their credit 
report and saying, ‘You know 
what? They don’t fit this guideline 
profile that we’re trying to go by, 
so we can’t help them’. Instead, 
we look at how long they have been 
in their job, doing their tax returns, 
their ability to pay. We’re looking at 
life stability.

Vice president for homeownership and mortgage 
services, Greater Indianapolis Habitat for Humanity

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Market segments

Elsevier has invested in other research solutions, such as SSRN 
an open access online pre-print community where researchers 
post early-stage research, Scopus Author Profiles showing 
pre-prints to provide an early view into a researcher’s focus areas 
and Digital Commons helping academic libraries showcase and 
share their institutions’ research via institutional repositories 
for greatest impact.

Print includes primary research and reference content in print 
format and some print-based commercial marketing services 
in pharma & life science promotion.

Market opportunities
Scientific, technical and medical information markets have 
positive long-term growth characteristics. Investment in R&D 
is critical for nations and corporations to create competitive 
advantage, drive innovation and economic growth, and solve 
societal issues such as climate change. This leads to long-term 
growth in R&D spending and sustained increases in researchers 
worldwide. As people live longer and aim to live healthier lives, 
health expenditure and the number of physicians and nurses 
also continue to grow strongly.

As a proportion of R&D is funded directly or indirectly by 
governments, spending is influenced by policy and budgetary 
considerations. Commitments to research and health provision 
remain high, even in difficult budgetary environments.

Strategic priorities
Elsevier’s strategic priorities are to help our customers solve 
critical and complex problems, by expanding content quality, 
coverage and utility; combining content with analytics and 
technology to build integrated solutions and decision tools that 
utilise advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence 
to improve productivity and outcomes, and enable insights 
underpinning critical decisions, benchmarking and evaluation.

In Databases, Tools and Electronic Reference, Elsevier is applying 
advanced linking capabilities to our vast research information, 
patent, research grant, drug information and medical claims data 
sets to develop products that help our Academic & Government, 
Corporate and Health customers make the right decisions based 
on their needs. For example, within health, Elsevier is developing 
clinical decision support applications using cognitive technologies 
and large image and text content repositories, leveraging its 
proprietary health graph. These applications will enhance 
delivery of content in care, helping health professionals make 
more accurate diagnoses, ensure appropriate care delivery 
and save lives.

In Primary Research, Elsevier’s priority is to support researchers 
by finding a home for every sound science article submitted, and 
providing choice in payment model, quality tier, and scientific 
discipline. We aim to deliver above industry average journal and 
article quality, at below average article cost, leveraging our scale 
and expertise. Elsevier works with customers to help them reach 
their research goals through excellence in content, service and 
value. Elsevier is building on its premium brands, enhancing 
quality through peer review, and increasing article volume 
through new journal launches, the expansion of open access 
journals and growth from emerging markets; and broadening 
the range and quality of insights across research solutions.

We continue to improve customer experience while driving 
operational efficiency and effectiveness; and collaborate to 
advance open science, inclusive research and inclusive health 
and support the UN SDGs, through our business and the Elsevier 
Foundation. In 2023 the homepage of ScienceDirect, our flagship 
platform dedicated to peer-reviewed primary scientific and 
medical research was recognised as the most accessible 
homepage by WebAIM among 1m websites. We also published 
the white paper ‘Demystifying Sustainability Assessment and 
Reporting Frameworks’ to help institutions plan and implement 
their societal impact initiatives.

Business model, distribution channels and competition
In Databases, Tools and Electronic Reference, solutions like 
Scopus, ClinicalKey and Reaxys, are generally sold direct to 
institutional, healthcare and corporate customers through 
a global sales force. Reference and educational content is 
sold directly to institutions and individuals and accessed on 
Elsevier platforms.

In Primary Research, science and medical research is distributed 
via the ScienceDirect platform, supported by two separate 
payment models to suit author preferences: pay-to-read 
articles funded by payments for reading made by individuals or 
institutions; and pay to publish (commonly known as open access) 
funded by payments for publishing, made by authors, their 
institution or funding bodies. Elsevier offers a range of pay to 
read and pay to publish options, both subscription-based and 
transactional, to fit the diverse needs of institutions, funders, and 
researchers worldwide. As of 2023, Elsevier serves over 2,600 
institutions worldwide with transformative deals that support 
open access to research. Nearly all of Elsevier’s over 2,900 
journals enable open access publishing, with more than 800 
dedicated author pays journals, the largest portfolio of open 
access titles.

Elsevier is a founding and driving partner of Research4Life, 
a United Nations initiative, providing free or low-cost access 
to research for publicly funded institutions in the world’s least 
resourced countries. Over 11,000 institutions in 125 countries 
participate. In 2023, Elsevier announced a geographic pricing 
pilot for its article publishing charges to support authors in low- 
and middle-income countries with equitable open access 
publishing choices.

Printed books are sold through retailers, wholesalers and directly 
to users.

Competition within science and medical reference content is 
generally on a title-by-title and product-by-product basis, 
typically with learned society publishers and professional 
information providers, such as Springer Nature, Clarivate and 
Wolters Kluwer. Decision tools face similar competition, plus 
software companies and customer home-grown solutions.

ClinicalPath:

Helping improve patient 

outcomes while reducing 

the cost of care

About ClinicalPath:

An evidence-based clinical decision 

support tool directly embedded into 

the clinical workflow.

Advances in digital healthcare information 
and technology help hospitals to deliver 
better patient outcomes while managing 
healthcare costs.

When Cone Health Cancer Center deployed Elsevier’s ClinicalPath, 
an evidence-based oncology pathways clinical decision support 
tool, as part of their clinical workflow, they embarked on a journey 
that would improve patient outcomes at lower cost.

Monica Schmidt MPH, PhD, Executive Director of Health 
Economics and Health Equity Analytics at Cone Health, explains: 
“We wanted to look at whether the ClinicalPath product… could 
reduce care variation, improve patient outcomes in terms of 
short-term survival and reduce the cost of care,” Dr. Schmidt 
said. “We hypothesised that giving our providers this kind of 
evidence-based guidance directly in the clinical workflow would 
result in achieving all three goals.”

The cancer center is part of Cone Health’s private, not-for-profit 
integrated healthcare network in North Carolina. It prides itself 
on providing state-of-the-art treatments and interventions for a 
variety of cancers in a compassionate community-hospital setting 
and recognises the importance of supporting its clinicians with 
the tools needed to make consistent, well-informed decisions for 
high-quality care.

To measure whether ClinicalPath could help reduce care variation, 
Cone Health Cancer Center looked at costs and outcomes for more 
than 6,700 patients treated between 2017 and 2022. The research 
team documented patient survival rates at three, six and 12 months, 
as well as the variable direct costs of care for the patients in the 
study. The group also measured the contribution margin, or the 
amount of revenue available after both variable and fixed costs 
of care were covered by recouped payments.

The results showed the impact of ClinicalPath, as Dr Schmidt 
explains: “…from the time patients received their first treatment 
for their cancer, they were more likely to survive all the way 
through 12 months if their oncologist managed care with decision 
support from ClinicalPath pathways.”

The group of patients documented as on-pathway in ClinicalPath 
were half as likely to die within three, six or 12 months of when the 
treatment began compared to cases in which it was not used or 
not followed through the entire clinical care pathway.*

When researchers looked at care costs they found that the use 
of ClinicalPath increased the overall cost of care for patients. 
The higher direct variable costs were due to the drugs or other 
treatments recommended by the care pathway.

However, the same evidence-based guidelines present in the 
pathway also influence reimbursement by providing reasoning 
around treatment decisions. On average, contribution margin 
increased by 74% when oncologists used ClinicalPath to guide 
treatment*. The recouped payments meant that cases guided 
by ClinicalPath were more profitable for the cancer center.

“Even though we were providing more care at a higher cost, 
we were seeing higher reimbursements to cover those costs,” 
Dr Schmidt said. Timothy Finnegan, MD Chief of Oncology, 
Cone Health Cancer Center agreed, saying, “Using ClinicalPath 
and collaborating with Elsevier has been a positive experience 
for both clinicians and patients. Patient-centric focus is of 
utmost importance.”

Patients were more likely to survive 
through 12 months if their oncologist

Even though we were providing 
more care at a higher cost, we were 
seeing higher reimbursements to 
cover these costs.

Monica Schmidt MPH, PhD

This collaboration has been a 
positive experience for both 
clinicians and patients.

analytics that help customers increase their productivity, improve 

decision-making, and achieve better outcomes.

LexisNexis Legal & Professional is headquartered in New York 

and has further principal operations in Dayton, Raleigh, and 

Toronto in North America, London and Paris in Europe, and cities 

in several other countries in Africa and Asia Pacific. It has 

11,800 employees worldwide and serves customers in almost 

150 countries and territories.

Revenues for the year ended 31 December 2023 were £1,851m, 

compared with £1,782m in 2022 and £1,587m in 2021. In 2023, 

68% of revenue came from North America, 21% from Europe, 

and the remaining 11% from the rest of the world. Subscription 

represented 79% of revenue and transactional revenues 

represented 21%.

LexisNexis Legal & Professional is organised in market-facing 

groups, focused on Law Firms & Corporate Legal, Government & 

Academic, and News & Business markets. Services are delivered 

primarily in electronic format, with print formats available where 

there is customer demand. Content and tools are tailored to 

the specific geographic markets served, supported by global 

shared services organisations providing platform and product 

development, operational and distribution services, and other 

support functions.

Law Firms & Corporate Legal, representing over 60% of revenue, 

provides legal professionals across law firms and corporate legal 

departments with electronic reference, decision tools, and 

analytics to help make better informed decisions in the practice 

of law.

Standard products for legal research and analytics include Lexis, 

Lexis+, and Lexis+ AI which provide statutes and case law with 

analysis and expert commentaries from secondary sources, such 

as Matthew Bender. Lexis, Lexis+ and Lexis+ AI include the leading 

citation service, Shepard’s, which advises on the continuing 

relevance of case law precedents.

Lexis+ AI was introduced in the US in 2023 and is a generative 

AI platform designed to transform legal work. It is built and 

trained on one of the world’s largest repositories of accurate 

and exclusive legal content, leveraging an extensive collection 

of documents and records to provide customers with trusted, 

comprehensive legal results with unmatched speed and precision 

and backed by verifiable, citable authority. The new Lexis+ 

AI technology features conversational search, insightful 

summarisation, and intelligent legal drafting capabilities, all 

supported by state-of-the-art encryption and privacy technology 

to keep sensitive data secure. Conversational search simplifies 

the complex and time-consuming legal research journey, 

providing a search experience for diverse legal questions 

with citations, facilitating lawyers’ ability to complete research 

effectively and efficiently. Summarisation provides a custom 

summary of legal documents to provide quick and insightful 

analysis. Drafting guides customers throughout the legal drafting 

process, generating a first draft of a legal document and allowing 

users to change the language and tone from a simple prompt.

Lexis+ is the cornerstone of online research and is being rolled out 
in additional countries and enhanced in existing countries. Lexis+ 
Canada was enhanced in 2023 with the introduction of Legal News 
Hub which brings together legal news stories, case summaries, 
analysis, podcasts, and more. In 2023, LexisNexis launched 
Lexis+ in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Africa. 
The enhanced platform aims to deliver greater efficiency and 
better outcomes, with data-driven insights to generate precise 
recommendations and search suggestions. Lexis+ Australia 
enables customers to quickly identify the key cases in relation 
to a specific legislative provision.

In 2023, LexisNexis continued to broaden the reach of its decision 
tools and analytics. Lex Machina, incorporated in Lexis+, 
expanded its API to provide access to Legal Analytics for State and 
Federal Appellate cases. Intelligize launched Board Profiles & 
Compensation, which analyses datapoints from proxy statements 
across thousands of companies and enables benchmarking in 
areas such as pay versus performance and board diversity.

LexisNexis also continued to expand legal news coverage with 
Law360 in 2023, with deeper reporting across the US, Canada, and 
UK including the launch of Bankruptcy Authority, UK Intellectual 
Property, and enhanced US jurisdictional coverage.

LexisNexis continued to enrich core solutions across global 
segments in 2023. In France, it completed the acquisition of 
Case Law Analytics, a French legal technology company that 
specialises in modelling legal risk data using AI. In Malaysia, 
Case Target was launched – an innovative, AI tool that synthesises 
a user’s search results, providing concise summary of the most 
authoritative cases within the practice area, complete with the 
most pertinent judicial reasonings.

In 2023, Practical Guidance released the Federal Government 
module, which provides practitioners with guidance on 
government contracting, agency law, administrative law, 
information law, and labour and employment law.

In the Intellectual Property (IP) analytics space, LexisNexis 
acquired Cipher, which utilises AI and supervised machine 

learning to classify patents using custom and industry standard 
taxonomies, helping customers uncover insights into complex 
patent landscapes and support strategic decisions.

LexisNexis Regulatory Compliance is positioned to support our 
clients in key regions globally, including the US and UK, assisting 
them in maintaining compliance registers across numerous 
topics including Cybersecurity, Banking, Gambling, ESG and 
more. The continuously expanding content portfolio is focusing on 
key legal obligations content in highly regulated industries and 
areas of law.

LexisNexis also supplies Legal Business Solutions such as legal 
spend management, matter management, and client engagement 
software. It launched InterAction+, a new cloud-based legal 
customer relationship management solution that unites a feature-
rich business development tool with a modern user experience, 
cloud infrastructure, and exclusive content from LexisNexis to 
help lawyers manage relationships and identify opportunities and 
at-risk clients.

Supporting its Rule of Law mission, the LexisNexis Rule of Law 
Foundation today partners with organisations in over 35 countries 
with more than 160 projects and activities since inception.

Supporting its Rule of Law mission, LexisNexis, in partnership 
with the African Ancestry Network, has provided scholarships to 
45 students at the six Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
law schools to examine issues of systemic racism in the justice 
system. The programme is expanding to include fellows from 
South African universities.

LexisNexis is also working with the Bangladesh Legal Aid 
Services Trust (BLAST) to enhance an app which allows workers 
to examine employment rights and laws on their phone and seek 
legal aid assistance if needed. The collaboration has enabled the 
app to address two new industries – construction and tannery – 
to those already covered.

serves customers across government organisations and 
law schools.

Lexis+:

a comprehensive resource 

for fast and accurate case 

law research

About Lexis+:

Lexis+ Singapore is a premium 

all-in-one ecosystem of integrated 

legal solutions, complete with 

superior research, practical 

guidance and gold standard 

drafting tools.

Rajah & Tann’s legacy is built on a 
commitment to excellence and to 
care for its colleagues, clients, and 
community. Founded in 1976 to pursue 
social justice through law, Rajah & Tann 
Singapore is now one of the ‘big four’ 
full-service firms in Singapore and a 
founding member of Rajah & Tann Asia, 
a network of legal practices which 
boasts over 970 fee earners across 
10 countries. They are known for being 
early technology adopters and were one 
of the first large law firms to adopt 
Lexis+ in the region.

In a technology-driven, ‘always-on’ professional world, clients 
now expect legal services to be immediately accessible at all 
times, while their legal and regulatory questions are becoming 
increasingly complex. Rajah & Tann’s ambition is to be unrivalled 
in its responsiveness to client demands, while continuously 
seeking new opportunities to deepen its foothold in Asia. The 
company also acknowledges that this vision must be pursued 
in a sustainable manner, without compromising on their values 
of fairness, integrity, generosity, and compassion, especially 
toward the well-being of their colleagues. Rajah & Tann firmly 
believes that leveraging technology in the delivery of legal 
services is necessary to meet both client expectations and the 
needs of their team members.

Through a combination of market-leading AI search technology, 
large proprietary content-sets, and superior data visualisation 
features, Lexis+, launched in June 2023 with case digests of 
Singapore supreme court judgements for the first time, cuts 
down the time needed for lawyers to conduct legal research 
while maintaining the accuracy and quality of the research output. 
Rajah & Tann lawyers can now use Lexis+ as the first port of call 
when conducting case law research. The solution’s user-friendly 
features have made legal research ‘less stressful’, as they can 
now simply ‘browse through the sections of the materials 
containing the search terms without having to open each search 
result. This makes it much easier to filter, identify and zoom in 
to the materials likely to be useful for their research’.

The benefits are not limited to fee-earners: the Knowledge 
Management team now spend less time training lawyers on 
using the system. For example, the innovative ‘Search Tree’ 
feature is particularly appreciated among younger lawyers, 
replacing the need to memorise and deploy traditional Boolean 
search techniques. This faster uptake in usage means a quicker 
return on investment on the firm’s subscription to Lexis+.

For Rajah & Tann, the future of legal services hinges on the firm’s 
success in technology adoption, and Lexis+ is a key element in the 
delivery of the firm’s growth strategy.

Up to 20%

We estimate that Lexis+ has made our legal 
research at least 10 to 20% more efficient based 
on how easy we’re able to identify and focus on the 
materials relevant to our research, allowing us 
more time to focus on analysing the outcome of 
our legal research.

The pace of legal practice has 
accelerated in recent years, 
influenced by client expectations 
for prompt and accessible legal 
services and the rapidly evolving 
legal and regulatory landscape. 
Rajah & Tann is constantly 
assessing and deploying 
technological solutions and 
innovations to help our lawyers 
work more efficiently to keep up 
with this pace, while maintaining 
a healthier work-life harmony. 
Lexis+ is one such solution that 
has helped our lawyers reduce 
research time and make legal 
research a less ‘stressful’ task.

addressing the needs of each particular industry, where 
participants from around the world meet face-to-face to do 
business, to network and to learn. Its events encompass a wide 
range of sectors. They include construction, cosmetics, data 
analytics, electronics, energy and alternative energy, engineering, 
entertainment, gifts and jewellery, healthcare, hospitality, interior 
design, logistics, manufacturing, media, pharmaceuticals, real 
estate, recreation, security and safety, transport and travel.

RX makes selective acquisitions to enter or increase presence in 
attractive sectors with high growth potential. In 2023 RX acquired 
Big Data & AI Paris expanding its access to the high growth market 
in data, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). Combined with 
Big Data London (acquired in 2021 and growing strongly) and 
the scheduled launch of Data Universe in New York in 2024, 
RX can now effectively and efficiently support this segment in 
three key geographies.

Similarly RX made selective launches to enter new attractive 
sectors (e.g. Renodays for green building renovation, Paris) 
or extend successful value propositions into new markets 
(e.g. Agri Week expanding into Kyushu, Japan; BCB for the drinks 
industry expanding into Singapore) or additional calendar slots 
(e.g. Content Tokyo into the winter).

Business overview

Exhibitions (RX) combines industry expertise with data and digital 

tools to help customers connect face-to-face and digitally, learn 

about markets, source products and complete transactions.

RX has its headquarters in London and has further principal 

offices in Paris, Vienna, Düsseldorf, Norwalk (Connecticut), 

Mexico City, São Paulo, Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, Singapore and 

Sydney. RX has 3,500 employees worldwide and its portfolio of 

events serves 42 industry sectors.

Revenues for the year ended 31 December 2023 were £1,115m 

compared with £953m in 2022 and £534m in 2021. In 2023, 

20% of RX’s revenue came from North America, 38% from Europe 

and the remaining 42% from the rest of the world on an event 

location basis.

Over 6m participants welcomed the opportunity to build their 

businesses at RX face-to-face events. RX ran 286 face-to-face 

events in 25 countries, up from 254 events in 2022.

2023 was a year of growth, with RX and its customers operating 

without major disruption throughout the year and in all 

geographies. Performance relative to pre-pandemic level 

improved through the year with the majority of events trading 

above pre-pandemic revenue levels.

In 2023, RX improved the range of digital products offered, 

increasing their sophistication and the value delivered to 

customers. RX’s digital products extended the reach of the event 

beyond the exhibition hall and increased the value of participating. 

Digital products grew in 2023 with electronic revenue accounting 

for 8% of revenue, up from 7% in 2022.

RX organises influential events in key markets focused on 

addressing the needs of each particular industry, where 

participants from around the world meet face-to-face to do 

business, to network and to learn. Its events encompass a wide 

range of sectors. They include construction, cosmetics, data 

analytics, electronics, energy and alternative energy, engineering, 

entertainment, gifts and jewellery, healthcare, hospitality, interior 

design, logistics, manufacturing, media, pharmaceuticals, real 

estate, recreation, security and safety, transport and travel.

RX makes selective acquisitions to enter or increase presence in 

attractive sectors with high growth potential. In 2023 RX acquired 

Big Data & AI Paris expanding its access to the high growth market 

in data, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). Combined with 

Big Data London (acquired in 2021 and growing strongly) and 

the scheduled launch of Data Universe in New York in 2024, 

RX can now effectively and efficiently support this segment in 

three key geographies.

Similarly RX made selective launches to enter new attractive 

sectors (e.g. Renodays for green building renovation, Paris) 

or extend successful value propositions into new markets 

(e.g. Agri Week expanding into Kyushu, Japan; BCB for the drinks 

industry expanding into Singapore) or additional calendar slots 

(e.g. Content Tokyo into the winter).

RX is committed to continuously improving customer solutions 
and experience by developing global technology platforms based 
on industry databases, digital tools and data analytics. By 
providing a variety of services, including its integrated web 
platform, the company continues to increase customer value and 
satisfaction by proactively putting the right buyers and sellers 
together on the event floor. Increasingly, digital and multi-channel 
services such as active matchmaking are becoming a normal part 
of the customer expectation and product offering, enhancing the 
value delivered through attendance at the event. Using customer 
insights, RX has developed an innovative product offering that 
underpins the value proposition for exhibitors by broadening their 
options in terms of the type and location of stand they take and 
the channels through which they can address potential buyers.

RX’s digital tools and platforms are being enhanced by a data lake 
that integrates internal data with external sources to provide 
better insights for its customers.

Business model, distribution channels and competition
Over 70% of RX’s revenue is derived from exhibitor fees, 
with the balance primarily consisting of admission charges, 
conference fees, sponsorship fees and online and offline 
advertising. Exhibition space is sold directly or through local 
agents where applicable. RX often works in collaboration with 
trade associations, which use the events to promote access for 
members to domestic and export markets, and with governments, 
for which events can provide important support to stimulate 
foreign investment and promote regional and national economic 
activity. Increasingly, RX is offering visitors and exhibitors the 
opportunity to interact before and after the show using digital 
tools and platforms such as online directories, matchmaking 
and mobile apps.

RX is one of the largest global event organisers in a fragmented 
industry, holding a global market share of less than 10%. Other 
international exhibition organisers include Informa, Clarion and 
some of the larger German Messen, including Messe Frankfurt, 
Messe Düsseldorf and Messe Munich. Competition also comes 
from industry trade associations and convention centre and 
exhibition hall owners.

Market opportunities
RX is well positioned for growth in face-to-face events. This will 
occur in parallel with an increased use of, and revenue from, 
digital tools and platforms, both stand-alone and as part of 
multi-channel events. These events combined with digital tools 
and platforms are a key lever for RX customers’ businesses 
and national economies to expand.

Growth in the exhibitions market is influenced both by 
business-to-business marketing spend and by business 
investment. Historically, these have been driven by levels of 
corporate profitability, which in turn has followed overall growth 
in gross domestic product. Emerging markets and higher growth 
sectors provide additional opportunities. RX’s broad geographical 
footprint and sector coverage allows it to respond effectively 
to changes in global trade and capture growth opportunities 
as they emerge.

As some events are held other than annually, growth in any one 
year is affected by the cycle of non-annual exhibitions. This cycle 
was disrupted by Covid-19 but re-established in 2023.

Strategic priorities
RX’s long-term strategic goal is to enable industry communities 
to conduct business, network and learn through a range of 
market-leading events and digital tools and platforms in all 
major geographic markets and higher growth sectors. This 
allows exhibitors to target and reach new customers quickly 
and cost-effectively, under one roof and with an integrated set of 
digital tools, resulting in measurably higher value and improved 
outcomes for both buyers and sellers.

RX focuses on four main areas that position it for long-term success.

Value to customers: RX constantly looks for ways to increase the 
value generated for customers, by innovating the offering and 
format of its events, and by deploying digital tools and platforms 
to enhance the face-to-face experience.

Portfolio optimisation: RX actively continues to shape its 
portfolio through a combination of new launches, strategic 
partnerships and selective acquisitions in faster growing 
sectors and geographies.

Best practice innovation: RX continues to drive best practices 
in a number of activities which increase the value generated for 
customers and improve its business performance, including 
marketing excellence, sales techniques, and the use of analytics 
to generate insights both for RX and its customers.

Operational efficiency: a lean, nimble structure is in place, able 
to respond to changing circumstances and customer needs. 
RX’s global technology platforms and more specialist functions 
allow RX to accelerate revenue growth, while controlling costs 
and embedding sustainability throughout the organisation. It also 
enables a faster and more agile deployment of digital products, 
new events and process innovation.

2024 outlook
We expect strong underlying revenue growth with a further

Strong underlying revenue growth and profitability 
improvement
Strong underlying revenue growth was driven by a significant 
increase in face-to-face activity across geographies, with 
average like-for-like event revenue across the portfolio 
ahead of pre-pandemic levels. 

We continue to make good progress on digital initiatives, with 
increased usage of a growing range of value enhancing digital 
tools for the customers of our face-to-face events.

The improvement in profitability reflects the higher activity 
levels and the structurally lower cost base of the streamlined 
event portfolio, with the adjusted operating margin now above 
pre-pandemic levels.

Big Data London:

Where data-driven 

businesses go for growth

About Big Data London:

Big Data London is a leading data, 

analytics and AI conference and 

exhibition. The 2023 event, held from 

20-21 September, was the largest in 

its eight year history, featuring over 

180 exhibiting technology providers 

and consultants, and 300 global data 

experts speaking across 15 theatre 

stages. A record 15,617 attendees 

came to discover the latest tools and 

techniques and hear from pioneers 

and industry leaders about the most 

effective data driven strategies. 

RX is taking Big Data London’s 

successful format to the US, with 

the launch of Data Universe 2024 

in New York City in April 2024.

Founded in 2017, and headquartered in 
Boston, Massachusetts, Starburst Data 
is focused on solving the pains of data 
access. Its solution, a full featured data 
lake analytics platform built on open 
source Trino, gives data-driven 
companies the capabilities they require 
to discover, organise, and consume data 
without the need for time-consuming 
and costly migrations. In just six years, 
Starburst has grown into an industry-
leading data mesh enterprise, trusted 
by companies like Sky, EMIS Health 
and Société Générale.

Starburst Data’s partnership with Big Data London began in 
2021 when the company participated as a Platinum Sponsor 
to establish its presence in the UK and European market. It 
has since come to regard the event as a strategic point in the 
calendar, providing the perfect platform to introduce and 
showcase its solutions, amplify its voice, and position the 
company as the industry leader in data lake analytics.

As a Diamond Sponsor of Big Data London 2023, with the largest 
exhibiting footprint on the show floor, Starburst’s objectives 
were clear-cut. The company strategically unveiled its 
partnership with Dell Technologies and used the platform 
to announce several pivotal updates for Starburst Galaxy. 
It brought HSBC and 7Bridges to the event to share their 
data lake house customer journeys. And it shared its latest 
co-engineered solutions with Dell Technologies, Oakland 
Group, and Turin Tech AI.

Starburst believes that Big Data London has had a 
transformative influence on its business as a catalyst for growth 
and collaboration in the world of data analytics and AI, fostering 
not only client relationships but also strategic partnerships.

It has now joined forces with RX as the Title Sponsor for a 
ground-breaking new event, Data Universe 2024 New York, 
modelled on Big Data London’s winning event format. In addition 
to a premier presence on the experiential expo floor, Starburst 
will deliver content curation for a dedicated data lake theatre 
at Data Universe 2024, offering use cases, presentations, 
and hands on workshops over the two days.

550 qualified 
leads

Starburst data welcomed over 2,400 visitors to 
its stand at Big Data London 2023 and attracted 
1,600 attendees to its plenary keynote. It also 
delivered approximately 200 demos, held 90 meetings, 
and generated more than 550 qualified leads for 
follow-up.

Big Data London never ceases 
to amaze us. The rich content, 
diverse attendee profile, the sheer 
size and shape of the event, and 
the exceptional team behind its 
success make it an unrivalled 
platform for us to engage with our 
audience and drive our business 
goals. Big Data London really is 
a true barometer for the rapidly 
growing data and AI industry.

Directors’ duties and Section 172 Statement
The Directors of RELX PLC – and those of all UK companies – 
must act in accordance with their duties under the 
Companies Act 2006 (the Act). These include a fundamental duty 
to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its 
members as a whole. The Board of RELX PLC, and its individual 
Directors, consider that they have done so for the year ending 
31 December 2023.

Details of how the Board and its Directors have fulfilled these 
duties can be found throughout this 2023 Report, and therefore 
the following sections have been incorporated by reference into 
this Section 172 Statement and, where necessary, the RELX 2023

Section 172 of the Act requires the Directors to have regard to, 
among other matters, the interests of the company’s stakeholders 
in working to promote the success of the company. The Board 
recognises the importance of building and maintaining sound 
relationships with RELX’s key stakeholders in order to achieve its 
business aims. Among the Group’s many and varied stakeholders, 
the Board has identified investors, employees, customers, 
suppliers and the communities in which we operate, as the 
company’s key stakeholders. Given its size, diversity and global 
business, stakeholder engagement takes place at all levels 
across the Group. To ensure adequate visibility of key stakeholder 
views, the Board received a detailed overview in the year covering 
engagement channels and activities the Company has with each of 
its key stakeholders.

In 2023, the Board also continued to oversee our substantial 
corporate responsibility activities, and maintained its focus 
on RELX’s Sustainability performance. The Board’s oversight on 
these matters is detailed on page 117 as part of Board activities, 
and page 119 as part of the Board’s engagement with the 
communities in which we operate.

We review the implications of our identified risks to ensure 
appropriate mitigation. For example, one strategic risk is 
customer acceptance of our products and services; we must 
therefore make certain they are reliable and high quality, 
responding to the views expressed through customer feedback 
programmes, including Net Promoter Score, and access 
initiatives to ensure those who might benefit from our products 
and services can do so. In this way, we minimise risk of financial 
loss and damage to our corporate reputation.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

Our approach to corporate responsibility

We set annual and longer-term objectives to 
ensure we continue to increase the positive 
impact we have on society through our 
business.

Dr Márcia Balisciano
Global Head of ESG and Corporate Responsibility, RELX

We align the objectives we set for our unique contributions, as 
well as those for the significant areas that affect all companies – 
governance, people, customers, community, supply chain and 
environment – with the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) to support the achievement of these 17 global goals 
by 2030.

We believe in timely, comprehensive reporting (see CR Disclosure 
Standards 2 and 3 for how we align with key standards, including 
the Global Reporting Initiative). Key non-financial metrics for 
environment, people and supply chain are independently  
assured. Corporate Citizenship assure our community

CR priorities
In this report we outline our approach to Corporate 
Responsibility (CR), our principal CR risks and how they map 
to our CR priorities, including operating with the highest 
standards, meeting customer needs, attracting and 
retaining the right people, maintaining an ethical supply 
chain and managing climate risks as presented in our 
Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (see 
CR Disclosure Standards 1). This Report also sets out 
alignment with the Sustainability and Accounting Standards 
Board (see CR Disclosure Standards 2).

Corporate responsibility performance begins with the purpose  
of the company. RELX is a global provider of information-based 
analytics and decision tools for professional and business 
customers, enabling them to make better decisions, get better 
results and be more productive.

Our purpose is to benefit society by developing products that help 
researchers advance scientific knowledge; doctors and nurses 
improve the lives of patients; lawyers promote the rule of law and 
achieve justice and fair results for their clients; businesses and 
governments prevent fraud; consumers access financial services 
and get fair prices; and customers learn about markets, source 
products and complete transactions.

Our purpose guides our actions beyond the products that we 
develop. It defines us as a company. Every day across RELX our 
employees are inspired to undertake initiatives that make unique 
contributions to society and the communities in which we operate.

To be a leading company we must act with the highest responsible 
standards, while channelling our strengths to make a positive 
difference for society. To us, CR is not a programme or prescriptive 
set of activities, it is how we do what we do on a daily basis. It is the 
responsibility of everyone at RELX.

CR gives us long-term sustainable competitive advantage. It inspires 
confidence in our stakeholders, and provides a ‘licence to operate’ 
in the communities in which we live and work. It underpins our 
business strategy to deliver improved outcomes for our customers 
by combining content and data with analytics and technology across 
global platforms and helps us build leading positions in our markets 
by leveraging our skills and assets.

Our approach to corporate responsibility

We set annual and longer-term objectives to 

ensure we continue to increase the positive 

impact we have on society through our 

business.

Dr Márcia Balisciano

Global Head of ESG and Corporate Responsibility, RELX

We align the objectives we set for our unique contributions, as 

well as those for the significant areas that affect all companies – 

governance, people, customers, community, supply chain and 

environment – with the United Nations Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs) to support the achievement of these 17 global goals 

by 2030.

We believe in timely, comprehensive reporting (see CR Disclosure 

Standards 2 and 3 for how we align with key standards, including 

the Global Reporting Initiative). Key non-financial metrics for 

environment, people and supply chain are independently  

assured. Corporate Citizenship assure our community 

disclosures against the Business for Societal Impact (B4SI) 

Framework. Full assurance statements are available at 

 www.relx.com/additional-cr-resources. CR is an integral  

part of the statements of the Chair, CEO and CFO (see pages 3, 4, 

and 92-97). RELX is subject to the European Union’s Corporate 

Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) from January 2024 and 

our first CSRD Sustainability Statement will feature in this section

6  For 2023, RELX moved to a new third party audit platform, which allows sharing of supplier audits across the platform therefore increasing the total number of audits.
 Signatories to the RELX Supplier Code of Conduct include suppliers who have not signed the Supplier Code, but have equivalent codes. These suppliers are subject 
7 
to the same audit requirements as Supplier Code signatories.
 Climate change and environmental data (carbon, energy, water, waste) covers the 12 months from December 2022 to November 2023.
 We purchase renewable electricity on green tariffs at locations in the UK and Europe. US Green-e certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are applied to electricity 
consumption in the US. US Green-e certified RECs are also purchased to equal 100% of any non-renewable electricity consumed outside the US; we do not apply any 
market-based emissions factors on this portion of electricity consumption.

 Covers all flights booked through our corporate travel partner in the calendar year. Uses the proprietary Cirium fuel-derived methodology. Further details are available on 
page 76. Previous figures restated following independent assurance.
 Percentage of paper graded as known and responsible sources by the Book Chain Project or certified to FSC or PEFC. Includes less than 0.5% of paper not yet graded  
or certified.
 Independently assured. See Independent Assurance Statement.

 All Group employees can take up to two days off per year, coordinated with line managers, to work on community projects that matter to them. Number of staff 
volunteering reflects the number of staff using volunteering hours, as well as those who participated in other Company-sponsored volunteer activities.
 Accident reporting covers approximately 82% of global employees.
 We continue to refine our supplier classification and hierarchy data, contributing to changes in the number of suppliers we track year-on-year.

 We define senior leaders as colleagues with a management grade of 17 and above.
 Data reporting methodology assured by Business for Societal Impact (B4SI). Reporting period covers 12 months from December 2022 to November 2023. 

 See B4SI assurance statement at www.relx.com/additional-cr-resources.

Prioritising key issues

To consistently understand the issues we should focus on, we consider our business priorities and engage regularly with both internal 
and external stakeholders. Employees are our primary internal stakeholder and we involve more than 4,400 colleagues across RELX in 
our CR networks, who in turn reach more people across the company. Examples of our stakeholder engagement in the year can be found 
at 

 www.relx.com/additional-cr-resources.

The basis of our 2024 CSRD disclosure will be a double materiality assessment (DMA) which identifies key issues for our stakeholders 
and those which meet a test of financial materiality, encompassing both risk and opportunity. In 2023, we engaged CR consultancy, 
Carnstone to assist with the DMA, supported by an internal DMA/CSRD Review Group comprised of 27 colleagues. The methodology and 
results of this undertaking will be part of our 2024 CSRD disclosure.

For our previous stakeholder assessment Carnstone contacted over 270 stakeholders – including investors, employees and suppliers – 
to rank 14 issues we consider important to the company. All 14 CR priorities were rated as either significant or very significant by 26% or 
more of respondents (at a minimum), indicating that we are focusing on issues they believe are critical for us.

further UNGC principles within RELX and in our supply chain. 
We demonstrated leadership as one of 900 early adopters of the 
Enhanced Communication on Progress (CoP) in 2022, among 
more than 20,000 signatories and completed the CoP again in 
2023. We contributed to the UNGC Leaders Summit and served as 
a sponsor of their Transformational Governance initiative. In the 
year, our Chief Sustainability Officer and Global Head of Corporate 
Responsibility completed her three year term as Chair of the 
UNGC UK Network and served on the Board of the Foundation 
for the Global Compact, which provides financial, operational 
and programmatic support to the UNGC.

The UNGC is a partner of the RELX SDG Resource Centre,

2023 PERFORMANCE

Meaningful support of SDG 10 by 
expanding financial inclusion efforts in 
Africa and APAC, including by providing 
lenders with improved risk information 
from alternative credit data to benefit 
more people

Financial inclusion is essential to the SDGs. With adequate 
wages and access to appropriate financial tools, citizens are 
lifted out of poverty, (SDG 1); avoid hunger (SDG 2); have better 
health (SDG 3); are more likely to receive quality education 
(SDG 4); and more women are likely to aid the financial 
well-being of their communities (SDG 5), among other 
SDG benefits.

Worldwide, the World Bank estimates that 1.4bn adults lack 
access to formal financial services, without access to basic 
transaction accounts they are excluded from financial 
opportunities because of a lack of a traditional credit record. 
The challenge of financial inclusion is often magnified in 
low-income countries, given gaps in identity verification and 
credit risk assessment.

Risk’s DecisionTrust uses transactions across a global digital 
identity network giving enriched insights to help lenders better 
assess borrowers, ensuring consumers are not underestimated 
while addressing the problem of ‘making visible the historically 
invisible’ – people with no credit record. In 2023, Risk ran 
DecisionTrust tests in 15 countries in Africa, Latin America, 
Eastern Europe and Asia. The testing took place with fintechs, 
banks and lending companies, which have historically struggled 
to incorporate lower income populations into the regular banking 
system. The tests show that applications (or reapplications) for 
credit would be granted in approximately 20% of cases as 
opposed to outright rejections previously.

inclusive approach to climate action

Elsevier works to build capacity and equity in research and 
health for an inclusive and sustainable future.

The Elsevier Foundation’s Chemistry for Climate Action 
Challenge supports green and sustainable chemistry and 
diversity to advance climate action in the global south. Two 
projects were selected from 94 entrants across 47 countries, 
with each winning project receiving €25,000 in funding. The 
first in the Philippines focuses on biodegradable packaging 
using agro-industrial waste supporting farming communities 
by providing them with an additional source of income. The 
second in Somalia produces methane gas from fruit waste 
and cow manure as a cheaper and cleaner alternative to 
traditional charcoal.

Also in the year, we held a workshop for winners of The World 
Academy of Sciences-Elsevier Foundation Climate Action 
Grants. Among eight women-led projects focused on innovative 
solutions to climate change is one in Guatemala focused on food 
security and resilience by restoring traditional home gardens;

Legal
LexisNexis Legal & Professional advances SDG 16 (Peace, Justice 
and Strong Institutions) through its products and services that 
promote the Rule of Law. The LexisNexis Legal & Professional 
global legal and news database contains 138bn documents and 
records providing transparency of the law in almost 150 countries 
and territories, with some 2.2m new legal documents added daily.

Through its content, data and analytics, LexisNexis Legal & 
Professional supports the four components of the Rule of Law: 
transparency of law, equality under the law, independent 
judiciaries and accessible legal remedy.

LexisNexis Legal & Professional partners with the International 
Bar Association (IBA) on the eyeWitness to Atrocities App, which 
allows human rights defenders to document and report human 
rights abuses in a secure and verifiable way so information can be 
used as admissible evidence in relevant forums. LexisNexis Legal 
& Professional utilises its data hosting capabilities to provide a 
secure repository for the information collected. Over 60,000 
photos and videos have been captured with the app since 2015. 
In 2023, eyeWitness was selected as a game-changing digital 
solution contributing to advancing the SDGs by the United 
Nations Development Programme in their SDG Digital 
Acceleration Agenda.

In 2023 the LexisNexis Legal & Professional US Voting Laws and 
Legislation Center won the Legalweek Leaders in Tech Law award 
for Justice Technology. The Center is a free resource offering 
public access to over 40,000 federal and state election and voting 
laws, including changes to laws over time, as part of an ongoing 
effort to advance transparency of the law.

LexisNexis Legal & Professional does in-depth research and 
produces reports on key legal industry developments, including 
the LexisNexis Legal Aid Deserts report. Access to legal 
representation is a fundamental element of the Rule of Law, but 
many have neither the resources to engage a lawyer nor qualify 
for legal aid. The report mapped resources throughout the UK that 
can help those without means, particularly in areas such as 
criminal, family or employment law. In 2023 the LexisNexis Rule of 
Law Foundation (LNROLF) also launched the fourth in its series of 
reports on 50:50 by 2030 which seeks to achieve gender equity in 
the legal profession with a focus on Nigeria.

In 2023, the LNROLF began work to launch a judgement writing 
tool for justices, judges and magistrates across the Ugandan 
judiciary. The tool will assist in alleviating court delays and will 
allow judicial officers to access information from the Uganda 
case management and repository systems and write 
judgements on templates curated from research from six 
different global jurisdictions. It will allow judicial officers to 
access this material within Microsoft Word, working offline 
and while away from both internet and electricity, a common 
occurrence in rural areas of the country.

Legal team members volunteered their time and expertise in 
the year to support a global project to identify laws around the 
world that discriminate against individuals who have suffered 
from leprosy. Results were provided by 14 volunteers on 24 
countries in partnership with the International Federation of 
Anti-Leprosy Associations, providing critical knowledge 
needed to target discriminatory laws through advocacy.

Since 2008, LexisNexis Legal & Professional has partnered 
with industry leading associations to recognise individuals 
and organisations for their commitment to the Rule of Law. 
2023 award honourees include Filipino lawyer Raphael 
Pangalangan, recipient of the IBA Outstanding Young Lawyer 
of the Year Award, jointly established by Legal and the IBA Young 
Lawyers Committee, to honour young lawyers who have shown 
excellence in their career to date, commitment to professional 
and ethical standards, and dedication to the community at large. 
Winners included Argentinian lawyer Maria Fernanda Mierez, 
recipient of the IBA Pro Bono Award; French lawyer Céline 
Bardet, recipient of the Union Internationale des Avocats/
LexisNexis Rule of Law Award; and Guyana lawyer Melinda 
Janki, recipient of the Commonwealth Law Conference/
LexisNexis Rule of Law Award.

2023 PERFORMANCE

Meaningful support of SDG 16 by advancing 
the United Nations Global Compact’s 
SDG 16 Business Framework on Inspiring 
Transformational Governance

The United Nations Global Compact states that 
‘Transformational Governance is a principles-based 
philosophy – not a new legal concept – that calls on 
business to be more accountable, ethical, inclusive and 
transparent to drive responsible business conduct, improve 
environment, social and governance performance and 
strengthen public institutions, laws and systems.’

During 2023, as a sponsor of the UNGC’s SDG 16 Business 
Framework on Inspiring Transformational Governance, we 
supported the creation of a Transformational Governance 
Corporate Toolkit, including bringing together key 

stakeholders at an event we hosted during 2023 UN General 
Assembly week in New York. It was also a theme at the RELX 
Rule of Law Café which we convene quarterly involving 
members of the legal community, bar associations, NGOs 
and peers.

Exhibitions
RX events strengthen communities and support the SDGs, 
including SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 9 (Industry Innovation 
and Infrastructure), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 12 
(Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 17 
(Partnerships for the Goals). In addition, RX supports SDG 13 
(Climate Action) through our Net Zero Events commitments and 
by using our event platforms to drive industry engagement in a net 
zero carbon future. RX is committed to using its event platforms 
to support and drive the SDG agenda by stimulating conversations 
and collaboration, and educating and influencing the industries 
it serves.

RX saw a strong return to face-to-face events in 2023 across all 
geographies. A number of events set all-time attendance records, 
highlighting the importance participants place on connecting and 
doing business in person, allowing them to see many customers 
and suppliers at one time. Increasing numbers of customers took 
advantage of new RX digital and data analysis tools to source 
business solutions and suppliers, capture and qualify more 
leads, and analyse and improve their event performance.

In 2023, as part of its five-year, $1m commitment to racial equity, 
RX continued to support nine global not-for-profit partners who 
are working to grow racial equity in RX communities. During 
the year, RX also announced partnerships with Black Young 
Professionals Network to advance the careers of black 
professionals in events; and Women in Exhibitions which aims 
to empower women in the exhibitions industry and help nurture 
the next generation of female leaders.

At the 2023 MIPTV television market, RX France presented its 
fourth annual MIP SDG Award which honours media companies 
for their contribution to delivering the SDGs. The 2023 award 
was presented to Silverback for their work supporting UN goals 
directed at climate action and the conservation of life below 

water and life on land. RX France is part of the UN SDG Media 
Compact which seeks to inspire news and entertainment 
organisations to leverage their resources and talent to amplify 
and accelerate progress towards achieving the goals.

In 2023, RX’s World Travel Market launched the inaugural 
Diversity and Inclusion Summit and pledged to ensure that 
50% of speakers within the conference programme come from 
under-represented groups ensuring broad perspectives and 
knowledge are passed on to WTM attendees.

Arabian Travel Market, hosted in Dubai, presented its new 
Sustainable Stand Award to Hilton for their work on engaging 
local suppliers in the creation of the stand and commitment 
to repurpose materials over the next three years.

RX’s in-cosmetics published its first Global Sustainability 
Trends Barometer, and a second regional report on 
sustainability in the APAC region. Both addressed the 
challenges and opportunities facing the cosmetics and 
personal care industry in its ongoing journey to reduce its 
carbon footprint.

MIPIM, the international property show in Cannes, launched 
a new Road to Zero area, combining 400 sqm of exhibition, 
networking and conference space, with a focus on ground-
breaking methods to decarbonise the real estate industry.

Across RELX
Recognising that across RELX we have products, services, 
tools and events that advance the UN’s 17 SDGs, we created the 
free RELX SDG Resource Centre in 2017 to advance awareness, 
knowledge and implementation of the SDGs. Since 2017, we 
have made over 1,800 journal articles and book chapters free 
to access via the RELX SDG Resource Centre which would have 
otherwise cost nearly £4m to make open access.

2023 PERFORMANCE

Meaningful support of SDG 13 by 
progressing the Net Zero Carbon Events 
Initiative and developing the net zero 
pathway for RX shows

In February 2023, RX published a Carbon Reduction Playbook 
to accelerate best practice across our event and operations 
teams in order to help them make more sustainable choices. 
To promote engagement with the Playbook, the RX Head of 
Sustainability undertook a roadshow and held online events 
that attracted 500+ attendees. This work will continue in 2024 
with the publication of a Pathway to Net Zero roadmap, setting 
out RX’s carbon reduction strategy to achieve net zero by 2040, 
with key milestones for all shows.

During the year, as a member of the Net Zero Carbon Events 
taskforce, RX participated in working group sessions to advance 
industry measurement of event-related carbon emissions, 
including event energy, waste, and production inputs. In the 
year, 56 venues covering 141 face-to-face events reported 
energy and/or waste data across RX. Additionally, we conducted 
carbon footprints of ten events to understand what data is 
available and get a fuller picture of emissions categories such 
as logistics and production. These footprints have formed the 
basis for specific event strategies to target reductions.

Highlighting the importance of industry collaboration in driving 
climate change action, RX partnered with Elsevier at the 2023 
London Book Fair on a new Sustainability Hub, which delivered 
three days of programming designed to raise awareness about 
climate change and encourage publishers to adopt sustainable 
responses across the supply chain. Elsevier and RX also 
partnered to calculate the emissions associated with Elsevier’s 
exhibition stand and highlight their carbon emissions label. 
RX will build on this work to calculate further stand emissions 
and educate exhibitors on sustainable practices.

climate change action, RX partnered with Elsevier at the 2023 

London Book Fair on a new Sustainability Hub, which delivered 

three days of programming designed to raise awareness about 

climate change and encourage publishers to adopt sustainable 

responses across the supply chain. Elsevier and RX also 

partnered to calculate the emissions associated with Elsevier’s 

exhibition stand and highlight their carbon emissions label. 

RX will build on this work to calculate further stand emissions 

and educate exhibitors on sustainable practices.

We held our annual RELX SDG Inspiration Day during the year with 
a focus on nature and biodiversity, giving thought leaders, 
corporate representatives, investors, governments, and NGOs 
a common platform to discuss challenges and opportunities for 
collaboration. Keynote speakers included former Secretary 
General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, and ethologist, 
environmentalist and UN Messenger of Peace, Dr Jane 
Goodall, DBE.

Since 2011, the RELX Environmental Challenge has been 
awarded to projects that best demonstrate how they can 
provide sustainable access to safe water and sanitation where 
it is presently at risk. In 2023 the awards were presented at 

Pollutec, an RX France event for innovative solutions in waste 
management, recycling, circular economy, water and energy. 
The $50,000 first prize winner was Lombrifiltro by CPlantae, 
a sanitary engineering firm and social enterprise based in 
Mexico that has developed and commercialised prefabricated 
vermifilters for onsite wastewater treatment, providing a 
solution for communities without access to a sewer system. 
The $25,000 second prize winner was TU Delft Water For 
Impact for their development of electroagulation, a method 
to treat surface water using solar power. For more information 
see page 78.

Helping our people pursue the highest 
standards of integrity
Doing the Right Thing is more than a phrase at RELX, it embodies 
principles that represent RELX’s culture of integrity. It includes 
ensuring respect for one another, incorporating ethics in all our 
actions; growing our business with integrity; holding ourselves 
and each other accountable; and taking time to ask questions 
and report concerns.

Doing the Right Thing is underpinned by clear actions for 
employees, among them, being honest in our dealings with others; 
respecting the law, our policies and colleagues; and courageously 
speaking out for what is right. RELX in turn provides relevant 
training and resources; enables a culture where people can feel 
comfortable speaking up and experience no retaliation when they 
do; and ensures concerns are listened to and acted on in a fair 
and timely manner.

The pillars of our compliance activities include conducting 
periodic compliance risk assessments; implementing effective 
policies, procedures, training and communications; overseeing 
misconduct reporting channels, investigations processes and 
remediation efforts; and monitoring and auditing internal 
controls. We engage in a legal and compliance risk assessment 
twice a year to identify the top legal and compliance risks to the 
Company. The RELX Operating and Governance Principles further 
describe the process, policies and controls to manage risk.

Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the Code) sets the 
standards of behaviour for all RELX employees and is reviewed 
regularly. Among other topics, the Code addresses fair 
competition, anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, employment 
practices, data protection and appropriate use of company 
property and information. It also encourages reporting of 
violations – with an anonymous reporting option where 
legally permissible.

We offer several reporting channels to report Code-related 
concerns, including an Integrity Line, available to employees, 
suppliers, and other reporting persons. The Integrity Line is 
managed by an independent third party and accessible by 
telephone or online 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The 
Integrity Line also includes an Ask A Question feature which 
allows employees to seek ethical advice before taking action. 
Reports of violations of the Code or related policies are promptly 
investigated, with careful tracking and monitoring of violations 
and related mitigation and remediation efforts.

  The number of reports received is publicly available on our 
website www.relx.com/investors/corporate-governance/
code-of-ethics

We maintain a comprehensive set of other compliance policies 
and procedures in support of the Code and our risk areas are 
reviewed and updated periodically to ensure they remain current 
and effective. We formally audit the compliance programme, 
including the Code, every three years. Our policies, including 
our anti-bribery policies, also comprise part of our adequate 
procedures for compliance with applicable laws. Full and 
part-time employees receive mandatory training on the Code – 
both as new hires and regularly throughout their employment – 
on topics such as maintaining a respectful workplace, preventing 
bribery and anti-competitive activity, and protecting personal and 
company data. Mandatory periodic training covers key Code topics 
and is supplemented by advanced in-person training for those in 
higher-risk roles or regions. Temporary staff and apprentices are 
also assigned training.

We engage in policy discussions that matter to our business and 
our customers. Strategic decisions about policy are made at 
senior levels of the company to help advocate particular policies 
and/or to share our expertise. We strive to help policymakers 
around the world understand our business, innovations and 
contributions to the public interest.

RELX employees may engage in direct advocacy. We also engage 
through trade associations, policy organisations and third parties.

Lobbying activities done on behalf of RELX Inc. are managed by 
the RELX Government Affairs team, and, in coordination with our 
legal teams, are vetted, tracked and reported as required by law.

Consistent with our commitment to fostering a culture of integrity 
including through good governance, RELX has a supplemental 
policy and training for our employees that specifically relate to 
engagement with government officials and agencies.

The Code and a related supplemental policy also address 
corporate political contributions, which are strictly prohibited 
except in the US, where such contributions and activities are 
permitted in certain states within allowable limits, if they 
comply with stringent reporting and disclosure regulations. 
Corporate political contributions require senior level review 
and approval. Corporate contributions are reported as required 
by law. Contributions are made on a bipartisan basis and no 
funds are donated for presidential campaigns or any other 
federal-level campaigns.

We remained diligent through the year in our ongoing efforts to 
comply with applicable bribery and sanctions laws and mitigate 
risks in these areas. Our anti-bribery and sanctions programmes 
include detailed, risk-based internal policies and procedures 
on topics such as doing business with government officials, gift 
and entertainment limits, gift registers, and complex sanctions 
requirements. Relationships with third parties and acquisition 
targets are evaluated for risk using one or more of the following 
methods, including questionnaires, references, detailed 
electronic searches, and Know Your Customer screening tools.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

We monitor and assess the implementation of our anti-bribery 
and sanctions programmes by continually reviewing and updating 
our policies and procedures; conducting periodic programmatic 
risk assessments; and conducting quality reviews and internal 
monitoring and audits of the operational aspects of the programmes.

We engage with our employees about compliance through digital 
communications and other media, including videos and animation. 
To raise awareness during Compliance Week 2023 we held 
challenges and quizzes, and recognised outstanding employee 
contributions to our culture of integrity with Integrity Hall of 
Fame inductions.

Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct supports the principles 
of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and stresses our 
commitment to human rights. In accordance with the UN’s Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, we consider where and 
how we operate to avoid human trafficking and modern slavery in 
our direct operations and our supply chain.

As stated in our Modern Slavery Act Statement, available at 

 www.relx.com, we stand against all forms of slavery and 

human trafficking. We do not tolerate it in any part of our business, 
including our supply chain. As a UNGC signatory we uphold its Ten 
Principles related to human rights, fair and non-discriminatory 
labour practices, the environment, and anti-corruption. Our 
policies are also informed by the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the 
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and 
the Women’s Empowerment Principles. We have consulted widely 
on a RELX Human Rights Policy which we will launch in 2024.

Data privacy
Data is integral to the solutions we provide that further our unique 
contributions as a business, including protecting consumers from 
the risk of fraud; allowing secure online transactions; improving 
access to financial, healthcare and government benefits; and 
delivering high quality medical care.

Recognising concerns and sensitivities around personal data, 
our commitment to data privacy remained a critical RELX priority 
in 2023 and continues to be supported by strong governance, 
transparency and accountability. Dedicated privacy teams 
implemented requirements for compliance with personal data 
protection regulations around the globe. In the United States, 
RELX continued to advocate for clear national privacy laws that 
protect consumers, bolster consumer trust and allow businesses 
to invest in data driven activities that serve the public interest. 
Certain US RELX companies have self-certified their participation 
in the Data Privacy Framework programme.

We proactively take into account privacy concerns in developing 
and offering our solutions. Our Privacy Principles, available at 

 www.relx.com/corporate-responsibility/being-a-

responsible-business/privacy-principles, guide our approach 
to the responsible collection and use of personal data and are 
supplemented by internal privacy policies and guidance that are 
updated by our privacy offices to respond to new requirements, 
best practices and expectations.

We undertake activities and training that deepen employee 
awareness about data privacy. For Data Privacy Day 2023, we 
organised internal panel discussions focused on privacy, AI and 
trust. We also celebrated the winners of the annual RELX Privacy 
Principles Champions Competition, which recognises the 
achievements of employees in protecting personal data and 
implementing our Privacy Principles.

2023 PERFORMANCE

Support of SDG 16 by increasing efficiency 
in fulfilling privacy requests at scale

As laws granting individuals more privacy rights continue to 
emerge around the world, RELX is receiving more privacy 
rights requests. In 2023, RELX privacy teams improved the 
forms and mechanisms used to intake such requests in 
order to increase efficiency in responding to the requests. 
These measures enable more streamlined services so that 
individuals are empowered to exercise their privacy rights as 
quickly and as easily as possible.

Cyber security
We observed Cyber Security Awareness Month with both central 
and business specific initiatives aimed at improving security 
understanding for employees. The theme for 2023 was Get Your 
Cyber Priorities Straight. Events included a new Cyber Security 
Escape Room Challenge; educational sessions on AI and Security, 
webinars on cyber security for all ages, and avoiding traps on 
social media. We also launched our bespoke video advice series, 
RELX Cyber Security Experts Say. In the year, 100%� of employees 
were included in monthly phishing simulation exercises. During 
2023, we continued to enhance our security efforts with additional 
infrastructure monitoring capabilities both internally and through 
third parties.

In addition to more than 1,000 questionnaires and audits by our 
customers annually, we also engage third parties to perform 
independent audits on certain of our products and services. 
These audits help build trust and assurance in our target markets, 
especially where sensitive personal information is involved. 
For example, we have completed SOC 2 audits on our Risk US 
datacenters and our Lexis+ product, in addition, our UK Risk 
products have been ISO 27001 certified. 84% of our product 
revenue in Risk is covered by a third-party audit.

2023 PERFORMANCE

Support of SDG 16 through successful 
completion and testing of technical 
resilience enhancement initiatives across 
the business areas

We invested more than $9.3m in 2023 across our business to 
enhance our technical resilience posture. This included 
initiatives in application dependency analysis, defining triage 
recovery order, implementation of resilient backups, and 
recovery testing, both desk-based and technical. Additional 
efforts will follow in 2024 to expand the scope of technical 
resilience applications and perform robust recovery testing.

Pensions and investments
The Statement of Investment Principles for our UK pension scheme 
demonstrates that the Trustee recognises that consideration of 
financially material factors, including ESG and climate risk, is 
relevant at different stages of the investment process. As long-term 
investors, the Trustee embeds consideration of such factors in its 
investment decision-making as they can have a material impact on 
risk and return. The Trustee has produced a Responsible 
Investment Policy which has been shared with all investment 
managers. Throughout the year, the Trustee Board received 
presentations from corporate responsibility (CR) experts and the 
Responsible Investment Sub-Group met on a number of occasions. 
Furthermore, the Trustee submitted its first Taskforce on 
Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report in the year.

CR issues are also relevant to the investment decisions made 
by RE Venture Partners, RELX’s corporate venture arm. REV 
continues to invest in ethical AI, sustainable food technology 
and the creation of inclusive content for language learning.

necessary for public services that benefit their citizens. 
Governments need codified tax laws to know when, how 
much and from whom they should be collecting. Citizens 
need codified and transparent tax laws to understand their 
liabilities and to advocate for fair collection and use of their 
remittances. Unfortunately, in many countries around the 
world, it is difficult for tax authorities and taxpayers alike 
to access tax law in a complete, up-to-date and 
consolidated form.

Work is currently underway on a pioneering Rule of Law 
project aiming to produce and maintain a set of freely 
available consolidated tax laws in Africa. RELX Tax, 
LexisNexis South Africa and the LexisNexis Rule of Law 
Foundation have worked closely with the Ministry of Finance 
in Ethiopia and made substantial progress in 2023. The 
project is close to completion and targeted for publication on 
the Ethiopia Ministry of Finance’s website in the first half of 
2024. In 2023, we secured the approval from the Rwanda 
Revenue Authority to commence a similar project in Rwanda.

2024 objectives

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

SDGs

People

We owe our success to RELX’s talented employees, including technologists, 
researchers, event directors, product managers, data scientists and many 
others. They are driven by a strong sense of purpose, and they count on us 
to create a fair, challenging, rewarding and supportive work environment 
where they can achieve their potential.

Our people 

At RELX, we understand that people value a sense of real purpose 
at work: knowing that their actions are contributing toward 
something positive for themselves, their colleagues, their 
customers, the environment, and society. The nature of our 
business means our people experience this in a number of 
ways, including advancing the rule of law, improving outcomes 
for patients, or helping customers achieve their goals; it’s at 
the heart of the relationship between RELX and its people.   

Supporting our employees is a core principle. We strive to  
create an inclusive, diverse and collaborative workforce and an 
environment which encourages employees to seek improvements 
in all they do. We have 130 Employee Resource Groups that allow 
colleagues to collaborate, advocate and engage communities, 
furthering inclusion and diversity at RELX. We conduct annual  
company-wide employee opinion surveys to understand what 
is working well and where we can do better to support our 
employees’ experience.  In 2023, our employee survey 
received responses from  approximately 88% of  our global 
employee population.

Suzanne Perry
Group Treasurer, RELX

At RELX, we provide our people with resources, tools and 
experiences to help them perform and grow. In 2023, we 
invested over $15m and more than 506,000 hours in learning 
and development opportunities that are regularly refreshed 
based on employee feedback and business impact. The 
effectiveness of these development options is tracked through 
our employee opinion survey, which monitors internal mobility 
and employee satisfaction with learning provision. 

In 2023, we had two key cross-RELX focus areas for skills 
development. Knowing that people manager capability is a factor 
in driving employee performance and engagement, we created 
the Manager CORE programme to enhance manager skills. More 
than 800 managers participated in 2023 and rollout will continue 
through 2024. As a technology-driven business, we have also 
continued our focus on technology skills development in the year, 
covering topics like artificial intelligence. Learning opportunities 

are designed to ensure employees do not only gain knowledge, but 
also have an opportunity to experiment and test their capabilities. 

Our CEO and executive committee members care deeply about 
helping our people to develop and each year work alongside other 
senior leaders to conduct organisational talent reviews. This is 
underpinned by Enabling Performance, our approach to personal 
development, which reviews skills and achievements and identifies 
opportunities for recognition and advancement. Enabling 
Performance encourages regular and impactful performance, 
development and career conversations for all employees.  

Many of RELX’s most senior leaders benefit from active focus 
on their present and future career objectives through our 
Management Development Process, which involves skills 
assessment and the creation of a personal development plan. 
Progress against development plans is regularly updated to 
ensure that career aspirations are being met and factored into 
succession planning, through the annual Organisation Talent 
Review Process, led by the CEO and Chief HR Officer. 

We offer a global mentorship programme, NetWorx,  
which is open to all on request. This digital mentoring platform 
recommends matches based on individual profiles and specific 
goals, creating six month long mentoring relationships. In 2023, 
the platform supported more than 1,800 active mentoring pairs.

Inclusion and Diversity

Business area initiatives include:

I have found true allyship here at RELX 
and an open, free, comforting space 
to be yourself. 

James Berry
Senior Technical Writing Analyst, LexisNexis Risk Solutions

At the heart of our approach to inclusion, is the belief that 
everybody should be able to succeed and grow in a business that 
values them. Feeling you work for a company, a manager and a 
team that really sees and embraces who you are is what inclusion 
is all about. Inclusion is to feel heard, to be valued, to contribute 
and to access opportunity equally, regardless of personal 
characteristics. We encourage and promote diversity of all types 
and believe that RELX derives competitive advantage from the 
breadth of backgrounds, diverse perspectives, opinions and 
differing ways of thinking that our people bring to everything 
they do. 

This is underpinned by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, 
where we prohibit discrimination and recruit, hire, develop, 
promote and provide conditions of employment without regard 
to race, colour, creed, religion, national origin, gender, gender 
identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, age, 
disability or any other category protected by law. This includes 
accommodating employees’ disabilities and religious beliefs 
and practices. 

RELX Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) encourage colleagues 
to collaborate, advocate and engage communities, furthering 
inclusion and diversity at RELX.  ERGs help advance a culture of 
inclusion, and this is further supported by allowing all employees 
to take two days paid time-off per year for ERG-sponsored 
activities. In 2023, there were 130 active ERGs and employees 
recorded over 19,000� ERG hours.  

A highlight of our 2023 ERG activity was the Inspiring Inclusion 
series of virtual events, designed to help colleagues understand 
and embrace the diversity of our global business. More than 3,200 
employees participated and external speakers included Makaziwe 
Mandela, a social and political justice advocate highlighting issues 
affecting African communities and trans activist Max Siegel.

Our 2020-2025 inclusion goals, covering all aspects of diversity, 
guide our efforts and in the year we progressed them through a 
variety of targeted initiatives. 

Gender (% women)

LexisNexis Risk Solutions’ Ignite and Accelerate is a bespoke 
leadership development programme with mentoring, coaching 
and sponsorship for over 61 high-potential women to date, to help 
further their career development. Since 2019, 62% of participants 
have been promoted, with an 83% retention rate.

Elsevier’s Rising TIDE Internship Programme is an ongoing 
internship programme, where college students and recent 
graduates from diverse backgrounds received paid internships 
to join technology, product development, publishing, marketing, 
and finance teams. There were 24 participants in 2023. Elsevier 
was named best company for diversity by Comparably in the year. 

LexisNexis Legal & Professional was recognised as a Best Place 
to Work for Disability Inclusion in the year, receiving a top score of 
100 from the Disability Equality Index. The Project Empowerment 
scheme continued which provides global training on how to 
successfully embed product accessibility. 

RX  was awarded the Race Equality Matters’ Trailblazer status  
in recognition of its work to address racial inequality within  
the organisation through training and recruitment initiatives.  
It recognised RX’s actions to create a more psychologically safe 
environment, increase representation of people of colour in the 
workforce, and improve the diversity of its candidate pipeline. 

Gender
In 2023, the gender diversity of our senior leader population was 
steady at 31% women senior leaders, while our women people 
managers increased from 44% in 2022 to 45%. In 2023, women 
comprised 40% of the Board. 

We have implemented a range of initiatives to enhance career 
development opportunities for women, particularly those who have 
the potential to grow into senior leadership roles. These vary by 
business area but typically involve mentoring, coaching and 
sponsorship to support career journeys.  For example, Elsevier’s 
Developing Talent for Gender Equity  programme started in 2019, with 
220 alumni to date.  Individuals who have completed the programme 
are more likely to appear on a succession plan, be promoted or have  
a job move, demonstrating improved talent outcomes. 

Our business relies heavily on technologists and we need to 
attract the best talent to support our business ambitions.  
We directly employ approximately 8,000 technologists, 26%� of 
whom are women and we aim to increase that number through  
a variety of initiatives including the Women in Tech Mentoring 
programme, Tech Talent Charter  and participation in events  
such as the Grace Hopper conference.

inclusion for a fourth consecutive year. We also scored 100% in the 
Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2023 Corporate Equality 
Index, the national US benchmarking tool on LGBTQ+ corporate 
policies, practices and benefits on workplace equality. 

We launched the Proud to be RELX mentorship programme 
which brings together the LGBTQ+ community and its allies 
across RELX, inspiring personal growth, career development, 
and a greater sense of inclusion. 77 colleagues signed up for 
the programme, forming 38 mentoring pairs. To ensure we 
are  recruiting diverse talent, we joined myGwork, the largest 
recruiting platform for the LGBTQ+ community.   

We are a member of the Open for Business Coalition which 
constructs and promotes the economic and business case 
for LGBTQ+ inclusion. 

Disability
Our Enabled ERGs champion disability inclusion across our 
business areas through training, events and mentoring. Disability 
Fundamentals is our online interactive training for managers and 
colleagues to learn about disability awareness, disclosures and 
accommodations. Our CEO is a signatory to the Valuable 500,  
a global CEO community revolutionising disability inclusion.  

We continue to strengthen and embed disability inclusion for our 
employees. Risk launched its disability allyship track which aims 
to educate on what it means to be a stronger ally to the Disabled 
and Neurodiverse community. Elsevier launched its Enabled 
Mentoring Programme in 2023, a programme designed to 
empower individuals with disabilities and create a more inclusive 
work environment. Legal was recognised as a Best Place to Work 
for Disability Inclusion in the year, receiving a top score of 100 from 
the Disability Equality Index. RX partnered with health and safety 
and legal teams to develop an Accessible Events Survey, to help 
identify accessibility improvements that can be made at future 
RX shows.

Inclusive workplace

Throughout the organisation there is an 
ingrained culture of trust, collaboration and 
respect, which is exemplified by the flexible 
working conditions that help to ensure a 
comfortable work-life balance. 

George Spice
Head of eSales, Elsevier

We have developed Ways of Working policies in the US, UK and 
the Netherlands to establish a framework for hybrid and flexible 
working that balances the needs and wishes of employees with 
the requirements of our business and to help managers 
make decisions. 

We have established policies for parental leave across RELX. 
In the US our Modern Family Leave benefit offers up to 14 weeks 
of paid leave following the birth of a child or adoption and up to 
8 weeks of paid leave to care for an eligible family member with a 
serious health condition. In the UK we have recently implemented 
a new parental leave policy across all business areas covering 
maternity, adoption, partner and shared parental leave. It applies 
to all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender and offers 26 
weeks enhanced maternity leave and six weeks of partner leave.

Across the business, we have provided training which 
encompasses inclusive leadership, unconscious bias, as well 
as psychological safety workshops for managers and teams. 
We measure how psychologically safe our employees feel 
through regular surveys and make intranet resources 
available to everyone. 

2020-2025 Inclusion goals
Gender: Increase women in management, senior leadership and 
technology roles over time

Race and ethnicity: Increase the racial and ethnic diversity of 
our workforce over time

LGBTQ+: Foster an LGBTQ+ supportive workplace tracked 
through employee surveys 

Disability: Foster a disability supportive workplace tracked 
through employee surveys

Inclusive workplace: Establish minimum global standards 
in areas such as flexible working and leave benefits; continue 
impactful global inclusion training and track effectiveness, 
including through employee surveys; engagement on inclusion 
across RELX, with leadership involvement and grassroots 
employee participation, including through ERGs

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

Health and safety
The importance of employee health and safety is emphasised  
in the RELX Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and in the RELX 
Health and Safety Policy, both available on 
These documents commit us to providing a healthy and safe 
workplace for all employees, as well as safe products and 
services for customers. The CEO is responsible for health and 
safety on behalf of the Board. 

 www.relx.com. 

We consult with employees globally on health and safety through 
staff and works councils and reinforce good health and safety 
practice through regular communications, including a dedicated 
intranet site with relevant information.  We also hold regular 
Health and Safety Committee meetings. 

We provide tailored health and safety training to employees 
and use the services of third parties to assist us in ensuring 
compliance with local health and safety rules and to promote best 
practice. This is particularly important for employees at higher 
risk of injury in the workplace, including those that work in our 
book warehouses and exhibitions. Where necessary, we engage 
local specialists to conduct safety reviews or air quality tests at 
specific locations. We also provide employee support following 
any incident or health concern. There were no work related 
deaths reported in 2023. 

With a number of employees continuing hybrid working 
arrangements (working from both an office location and home), 
we provide health and safety support for both office and home 
working, and over 5,000 employees have completed our Healthy 
Working programme which includes personalised risk 
assessments and action plans. 

We regularly monitor and ensure our buildings are maintained 
and comply with relevant health and safety legislation and 
standards, in conjunction with third parties and landlords, 
where appropriate. 

RX has instituted an internal programme of recording, reviewing 
and continual learning from health and safety-related incidents to 
enhance safety across our events, given the safety risks during the 
construction and dismantling of an exhibition event. The business 
regularly reviews mitigations to ensure hazards are appropriately 
managed, and engages with local and global exhibition industry 
associations, working together to drive best practice and safety 
standards at all our events.

Well-being and support

What I love about RELX’s well-being 
programmes is that they provide a platform 
for people to connect and make work a 
happier place. 

Mai Trinh
Head of Tax Risk, Reporting and Reputation, RELX

We support the physical and mental health of our people, with 
dedicated health and well-being resources available to all employees 
including a well-being hub with free access to the Headspace mental 
health app, and fitness classes, as well as training courses. 
Additionally, we have a network of more than 90 Well-being 
Champions. 

We offer employee assistance programmes to all our employees, 
providing professional counselling to help them and their family 
members with personal or work-related issues that may impact 
their health or well-being. This service is available 24 hours a day, 
365 days a year. 

2023 PERFORMANCE

Relaunch Fit2Win global employee fitness 
competition

In 2023 we relaunched the RELX Fit2Win competition where 
employees worked in teams to climb a virtual mountain by 
logging their activities on an app; running, cycling, swimming, 
or walking over a two-week period.  

Over 100 teams took part, with more than 400 participants 
logging 7,553 activity hours. The winning teams received cash 
donations ($1,000, $750, $500) to charitable causes of their 
choice, which included the Center for Animal Rescue and 
Enrichment of St. Louis, World Bicycle Relief and UNICEF. 

Reward
We have robust and well-established reward mechanisms across 
RELX, with a strong emphasis on performance, fairness, equity 
and market competitiveness. We provide reward education for 
people managers across our four business areas which includes 
training on pay equity; they also have access to on-demand reward 
eLearning modules with content added to onboarding materials 
for new managers. In 2023, we continued our efforts to help 
employees understand more about reward practices with 
materials explaining market benchmarking and how we make 
sure rewards are competitive. 

RELX is a Living Wage accredited employer in the UK, certified  
by the Living Wage Foundation. We regularly review our global 
salary benchmarking data, using a variety of data sources. We 
make adjustments based on market competitiveness and pay 
equity and we formally review wages at least once a year.

SDGs

Customers

We recognise that the growth and future of our company is dependent on 
our ability to deliver information-based analytics and decision tools in a 
sustainable way to customers.

Improving customer outcomes

Our goal is to improve outcomes for our customers by providing 
information-based analytics and decision tools for professional 
and business customers that benefit their daily work.

Gemma Hersh
SVP Global Academic and

The first question we ask ourselves 
when developing our products is, 
will this help our customers solve 
a problem? Through a continuous 
process of customer feedback and 
engagement, we gain the insights 
we need to ensure our solutions 
can help our customers answer 
questions, solve problems and 
plan for the future.

Peer Review
To ensure the quality of scientific papers submitted to Elsevier, 
primary research journals undergo peer review. This means 
that once received from an author, editors send papers to 
specialist researchers in the field. In most disciplines, this is done 
anonymously. In some cases, the process is ‘double blind,’ where 
both the reviewer and the author are anonymous, to limit bias 
based on an author’s gender, country of origin, academic status 
or previous publication history. It may also help ensure that articles 
written by renowned authors are considered on the content of their 
papers, rather than reputation.

Elsevier’s Peer Review Workbench (PRW) provides researchers 
and academics, upon application, access to Elsevier journal 
manuscript metadata to allow systematic analyses of peer review 
processes at scale. PRW advances transparency and evidence-
based studies in the journal editorial and peer review process.

Elsevier also enables the automatic sharing of peer review 
metadata with a feed of peer review information from our 
submission and peer review system Editorial Manager to Open 
Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) once the peer review 
process has been completed. ORCID is a not-for-profit, 
cross-publisher organisation that fosters trustworthy connections 
between researchers and their institutions. Researchers receive 
a unique ID they can connect to their peer review activities across 
journals and publishers to showcase their reviewing work. Data 
is supplied directly by participating publishers and cannot be 
entered manually ensuring reliability.

2023 PERFORMANCE

Support of SDG 8 by rolling out the RELX 
Responsible AI Principles across the 
business areas

As data science and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly 
applied across RELX to improve customer outcomes and 
business processes, we created the RELX Responsible AI 
Principles to guide their use. The Principles were published 
in 2022 and are publicly available at 
corporateresponsibility/engaging-others/policies-and-
downloads. The Principles are accompanied by a RELX position 
paper on AI and a dedicated address that anyone can use to 
provide feedback or raise queries: ResponsibleAI@relx.com

 www.relx.com/

The Principles state: We consider the real-world impact of our 
solutions on people, we take action to prevent the creation or 
reinforcement of unfair bias, we can explain how our solutions 
work, we create accountability through human oversight, 
we respect privacy and champion robust data governance.

The Responsible AI & Data Science (RAIDS) team works 
to implement the RELX Responsible AI Principles across 
the company. They are responsible for developing policy, 
processes, tools, resources and training to support teams 
working with data science, machine learning and AI in 
embedding the Principles in their day-to-day activities.

In 2023, we published the RAIDS policy and accountability 
framework which is integrated into our new Data Science 
Project Review governance process and supported the 
business with rollout and adoption. The purpose of the 

policy is to support colleagues in implementing the RELX 
Responsible AI Principles in their business area, drawing on 
best practice from within our business and other organisations.

Four primary RAIDS Champions, embedded across the 
company, provide ad-hoc training and support in priority areas, 
particularly around generative AI projects, as well as a wider 
network of more than 85 colleagues working on integration 
of the Principles in products and workflows. In 2023, they 
collectively supported more than 30 projects, held tailored 
workshops and training sessions and published a suite of 
self-service resources and training videos. Feedback from the 
workshops will inform a review and update to the Principles in 
2024, reflecting the speed and scale at which AI is evolving.

Digital knowledge and innovation: 
advancing customer goals
Across RELX, we work to address customer challenges 
through digital innovation.

In 2023, electronic products and services accounted for 
83% of revenue, up from 30% in 2003.

Risk
ICIS, part of Risk, is a global provider of chemical and energy 
marketing intelligence. In 2023, ICIS launched the first Pyrolysis 
Oil Pricing Indices to address increasing consumer demand for the 
pricing of chemical recycling outputs. The new price series sits 
alongside ICIS’ comprehensive coverage of key recycling chains.

Supplier Carbon Footprints, which harnesses ICIS’ 
understanding of chemical markets combined with carbon 
footprint data from lifecycle data providers Carbon Minds, 
enables companies to identify, measure, and manage 
opportunities to reduce global supply chain emissions for 
chemicals and plastics, with ground-breaking GHG emission 
data by supplier, region and plant. For many businesses, Scope 3 
emissions in particular account for most of the overall carbon 
footprint of a company. ICIS customers are now able to report 
emissions and identify areas of focus, empowering customers 
to make supply chain decisions that could significantly reduce 
their Scope 3 emissions.

Scientific, Technical & Medical
Elsevier announced Scopus AI in 2023 which provides summaries 
and relevant references in response to natural language 
questions about research topics. Scopus AI combines generative 
artificial intelligence with Scopus’ trusted content and data to help 
researchers gain deeper insights faster, facilitate collaboration, 
and increase the societal impact of research. Scopus AI provides 
summaries based on abstracts, allows navigation for extended 
exploration, and cites sources. Elsevier ensures that the content 
used in Scopus AI is rigorously vetted, based on over 29,000 
academic journals from more than 7,000 publishers worldwide.

Elsevierannounced an early access launch of ClinicalKey AI in the 
year, which helps physicians access accurate evidence-based 
information at the point of care, by combining Elsevier’s large 
corpus of trusted medical information with advanced AI 
technology. It features conversational search to accelerate access 
to evidence-based clinical information and adheres to industry 
data privacy and security standards and the RELX Responsible 
AI principles.

Also in 2023, Elsevier launched EmBiology, an AI-driven research 
tool that provides visualisations of biological relationships, giving 
researchers a rapid understanding of disease biology and 
allowing them to focus on critical evidence. Researchers working 
in drug discovery and development are able to intuitively explore 
biological relationships and concepts to improve drug target and 
biomarker identification and prioritisation, enabling more 
confident decision making about what targets to pursue.

Legal
Legal introduced Lexis+ AI in 2023, a generative AI product 
designed to streamline legal research and drafting. The new 
platform delivers trusted results in an easy-to-use interface 
with hallucination-free, linked legal citations, combining AI 
technology with proprietary LexisNexis search technology. 
It features conversational search, intelligent legal drafting, 
insightful summarisation and document upload capabilities, 
all supported by encryption and privacy technology to keep 
sensitive data secure.

In 2023, Legal launched InterAction+, a cloud based legal CRM 
solution to help lawyers manage relationships and identify 
opportunities and at-risk clients. With exclusive content from 
LexisNexis Legal and Professional, US customers can view 
litigation events by firm, practice area and jurisdictions of 
clients and prospects.

Exhibitions
Digital event technology continued to transform the way RX’s 
customers connect and do business by enabling them to create 
and capture more value. Emperia is RX’s badge scanning mobile 
app that enables exhibitors to capture and qualify leads. In 2023 
60% of exhibitors used Emperia at events where it was available 
and at RX’s ISC West and Interphex 2023 shows adoption rates 
reached 100%.

RX collects and uses behavioural data to help its customers make 
better decisions. It’s Exhibitor Dashboard brings together event 
data and insights in real time, allowing customers to analyse their 
results, improve their event performance and justify financial 
investment. In 2023, the dashboard was made available to over 
29,000 exhibitors at 104 RX events, of which 33% used the tool.

2023 PERFORMANCE

Support of SDG 17 by strengthening 
Corporate Responsibility and Sales team 
engagement

In 2023, we developed materials to help sales teams build 
awareness of our CR priorities with their customers. This 
included an animated video highlighting how RELX products 
and services impact society and contribute to advancing the 
SDGs. The video was featured at the RELX global senior 
management conference and a longer version will be part of 
RELX onboarding materials and a new toolkit launching in 2024.

We presented our Annual RELX SDG Customer Awards  
during the RELX SDG Inspiration Day. These included Neste, 
nominated by ICIS and Proagrica, part of LexisNexis Risk 
Solutions. Neste is pioneering more sustainable aviation fuel 
and has committed to supporting customers to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 million tonnes of  
CO2e annually by 2030. Solvay, a global leader in materials, 
chemicals and solutions, was nominated by Elsevier for its 
One Planet roadmap covering three categories; climate, 
resources and better life, with ten measurable commitments 
where the company has the biggest positive impact. Panasonic, 
nominated by LexisNexis Legal & Professional, aims to reduce 
CO2 emissions by more than 300 million tonnes, or about 1%  
of the current total global emissions, by 2050. RX nominated 
Silverback Films, using the power of film-making and 

Responding to customer needs
Listening to our customers allows us to deepen our understanding 
of their needs and drive improvements. We do this through regular 
surveys, customer dashboards and feedback mechanisms. 
With input from customer insight teams across our company, 
we calculated a RELX-wide customer satisfaction metric showing 
that in 2023, 86% of customers would recommend working 
with RELX.

Access to information
In primary research we offer two separate payment models for 
our science and medical journals to suit author preferences: 
pay-to-read articles funded by payments for reading made by 
individuals or institutions; and pay-to-publish (commonly known 
as open access) funded by payments for publishing made by 
authors, their institutions or funding bodies, with the research 
freely available to read by all upon publication. We offer a range 
of pay-to-read and pay-to-publish options, both subscription-
based and transactional. Nearly all of Elsevier’s 2,900 journals 
enable open access publishing. We welcome debate in 
government, academic and library communities regarding  
the mechanisms by which scientific outputs should be openly 
available and continue to create new access options together 
with industry partners.

During 2023, Elsevier announced a geographical pricing pilot 
to support authors in low- and middle-income countries with 
equitable open access publishing options. The pilot will run 
across 143 of Elsevier’s Gold Open Access journals and tailor 
pricing structures according to Gross National Income per 
capita. The model aims to reduce financial barriers that hinder 
researchers and institutions from low- and middle-income 
countries from publishing research in Gold Open Access 
Journals. Elsevier continues to waive article publishing 
charges for authors in the lowest economic band.

story-telling to reveal the urgent truth of our changing planet to 
a global audience.

We published visual stories for internal and external audiences 
to mark the SDG midway point and included a summary of  
tools and reports from across RELX that advance the SDGs 
such as LexisNexis Legal and Professional’s Exploring the 
Global Sustainable Innovation Landscape: The Top 100 
Companies and Beyond Report, Elsevier’s Biodiversity 
Research in the Netherlands and Worldwide Report,  
and The RX Sustainability Playbook.

Customers are increasingly engaged in corporate 
responsibility matters and to address this increased interest 
the CR team supports sales teams in responding to customer 
surveys and requests for information. Such requests have 
increased by more than 300% since 2021.

Elsevier is a partner of Clearinghouse for Open Research 
(CHORUS) which enables public access to funded research. 
CHORUS utilises publishers’ existing infrastructure for 
discoverability, search, archiving and preservation of scientific 
and medical research articles, and it is now integrated into the 
ScienceDirect platform. Furthermore, members of the public can 
read Elsevier’s peer-reviewed content through walk-in access at 
public and academic libraries around the world. Our ScienceDirect 
platform is available to the public through onsite user access from 
any participating university library or UK public library via the 
Access to Research programme.

Providing access in countries with low resources is a priority for 
us. Through Research4Life, more than 11,500 institutions in over 
125 low- and middle-income countries receive affordable access 
to over 200,000 peer-reviewed resources. Elsevier is a founding 
partner, providing around 21% of the content in Research4Life, 
as well as access to our abstract and citation database Scopus. 
Elsevier offers free media access to over 2,000 journalists through 
our newsroom. In addition, Patient Access provides patients and 
caregivers with access to individual papers related to medicine 
and healthcare at no cost, upon request, within 24 hours.

Elsevier publishes a suite of nine journals, called Research 
Elements, which focus on research methods, data and equipment. 
Openly sharing and describing the methodologies and data 
generated by experiments improves the reproducibility of 
published research. Researchers who have published in these 
journals note benefits such as reaching new readers, sharing 
innovative technologies and making research more accessible.

Bringing science into society
 We work closely with journalists to ensure that research findings 
are accurately and effectively communicated to the public, and 
that authors receive credit for their work. A number of journalists 
receive free access to all Elsevier publications via Elsevier’s Media 
Access programme.

Researchers who published an outstanding peer-reviewed article 
that has significantly impacted people’s lives around the world, or 
has the potential to do so, are recognised with the Elsevier Atlas 
Award. The articles are made freely available and translated into 
everyday language, while author interviews are made public to 
encourage the dissemination or implementation of their findings. 
Content is linked to the SDGs and is featured on the RELX SDG 
Resource Centre.

We provide essential resources in times of emergency, making 
full text articles free to access for healthcare professionals, 
researchers, librarians and members of the public affected by 
disasters. While the World Health Organisation has now ended the 
Public Health Emergency of International Concern categorisation 
for Covid-19 and Mpox, all related content published through July 
2023 will remain freely available, encompassing early-stage and 
peer-reviewed research, as well as evidence-based clinical 
overviews, patient education and drug monographs.

In 2023, Elsevier continued to offer free resources to Ukrainian 
researchers via a Ukrainian Academic Support page online where 
researchers can access waived and reduced author publishing 
charges for open access journals. They also have access to 
publishing resources on Researcher Academy, which provides 
researchers free e-learning modules developed by global experts 
and career advice. They can also register for free access to 
ScienceDirect, Scopus and SciVal as well as clinical resources  
such as ClinicalKey, Complete Anatomy and Osmosis. To support 
Ukrainian journal editors and authors, we worked with the Polish 
Academy and the Ukrainian Council of Young Scientists to deliver 
two workshop series, one for editors and another for authors.

The Lancet celebrated its bicentennial in the year with a 
commitment to ensuring that medicine improves lives and that 
knowledge transforms society for the better. The Lancet affirmed 
its five key priorities – universal health coverage, mental health: 
climate health, health research, and child and adolescent health; 
emphasising collaboration with the medical community to 
advance healthcare and increase the social impact of science.

Elsevier’s Library Connect programme, with a website, 
newsletter, events, social media offerings, as well as a new 
Library Connect Academy, provides library and information 
science professionals worldwide with opportunities for 
knowledge sharing. As of 2023, there were 60,000 Library and 
Information Science (LIS) professionals globally subscribed to  
the Library Connect Newsletter, a complimentary publication, 
covering LIS best practices, trends and technology.

During 2023, the Library Connect website, containing articles, 
infographics, videos and other resources, received approximately 
30,000 visitors. The Library Connect website is currently ranked 
sixth in the top 90 librarian blogs and websites for librarians by 
Feedspot, a content aggregator for blogs and websites.

Accessibility
We strive to empower all people, including persons with disabilities, 
by ensuring our products and services are accessible and easy to 
use by everyone. Our commitment to accessibility is embedded 
across RELX and advances our Inclusion Policy. We follow the 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 level AA).

We maintain an Accessibility Policy that highlights industry 
standards and tools to embed accessibility into our products 
and our business operations. We apply best practice from the 
RELX Accessibility Policy across hundreds of digital products 
and websites.

Our Accessibility Policy is available at 
cr-downloads.

 www.relx.com/

Risk employees continued enhancing our A11yCAT tool to help 
developers address accessibility bugs in real time while edition 
2.0 was successfully beta tested in the year for release in 2024. 
It will highlight code to help developers discover errors.

Elsevier empowers all learners by providing features such as 
full-text search, marked tables, magnifiable content, screen 
reader compatibility and high-contrast text. Its Health Education 
Systems Incorporated (HESI) Delivery Operations team continued 
to work with HESI testing candidates that register to take a HESI 
exam remotely via our remote proctoring vendors. Since 2019, the 
team has processed more than 800 candidate accommodation 
requests, ensuring that these candidates have an accessible and 
inclusive experience.

In 2023, members of the Accessibility Working Group logged over 
275 accessibility projects and Elsevier’s Global Books Digital 
Archive fulfilled more than 3,200 disability requests, 91% of them 
through AccessText.org, a service we helped establish. In 2023, 
Elsevier was designated a Global Certified Accessible publisher by 
Benetech, a non-profit organisation based in Palo Alto, California. 
The certification recognises publishers that meet specific 
accessibility criteria to support readers with disabilities and 
learning differences. Relevant file testing received 100% scores 
in all categories.

In 2023, Elsevier’s ScienceDirect achieved zero errors on its 
homepage with the WAVE accessibility testing tool, making the 
research platform number one of the top 1m websites ranked 
in the 2023 WebAIM Million accessibility report.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

2023 PERFORMANCE

Support of SDG 10 by expanding the 
Accessibility Champions model across 
RELX

RELX is committed to creating products that are usable by 
everyone including people who experience some type of 
disability. A network of Accessibility Champions advance the 
RELX Accessibility Policy and encourage teams to incorporate 
accessibility requirements from the start and to use best 
practices to ensure an optimal experience for disabled users. 
The RELX Accessibility Leadership Advisory Board convened 
during the year to address challenges and approaches  
to accessibility.

We expanded the accessibility training model across the  
four business areas during the year. We also released an 
Introduction to Accessibility video accompanied by a quick  
start guide for product managers, ensuring accessibility 
requirements are embedded in our products.

In 2023, we celebrated the fifth annual RELX Accessibility 
Leadership Awards, introducing a new award category for 
team leadership. Winners received a glass award with a braille 
inscription and featured in an all-employee news article. 

In 2023, Elsevier signed the UK Publishers Association 
Accessibility Action Group Accessible Publishing Charter and 
also worked closely with university disability services offices, 
launching a survey and interviews to understand how to better 
serve students with disabilities. In the sixth year of Elsevier’s 
Accessibility Belting programme, 85 additional colleagues 
received belts (more than 340 people have completed the 
programme since inception). Additionally, the Elsevier Digital 
Accessibility Team provided awareness trainings for new hires as 
part of onboarding. They also conducted research into automated 
text descriptions and sonification to help users with disabilities 
better understand trends in data, holding six sessions with 
visually impaired people to better understand how to develop 
useful text descriptions for speech technologies.

We worked with disability services offices, procurement officials 
and instructors across the world to provide Voluntary Product 
Accessibility Template (VPAT) and Accessibility Conformance 
Reports. Customers can also utilise the accessibility@relx.com 
Inbox to connect with an accessibility expert and make VPAT 
and report requests. In 2023, Risk completed 26 VPATs; Legal’s 
Accessibility UX team resolved over 100 customer enquiries 
and generated VPATs for 30 products.

We also made a donation to the charity of their choice. 
Nominees were honoured for product enhancements to key 
products which led to the two highest Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) compliance scores in Elsevier history 
and for improving accessibility for internal colleagues.

We promoted accessibility to outside companies and vendors 
throughout the year. RELX accessibility teams partnered with 
external content providers, including Highcharts, to advance 
accessible solutions for public benefit. Elsevier has collaborated 
with Highcharts for over eight years to continually improve the 
accessibility of its widely used chart library.

Community

Contributing to our local and global communities is a responsibility 
and an opportunity.

RELX Cares, our global community programme, supports 
employee volunteering and giving that makes a positive 
impact on society.

The mission of RELX Cares is education for disadvantaged young 
people that advances one or more of our unique contributions as 
a business. Employees have up to two days’ paid leave per year 
for their own community work. A network of over 245 RELX Cares 
Champions ensures the vibrancy of our community engagement.

In 2023, we held the 13th Recognising Those Who Care Awards 
to highlight colleagues who have made outstanding contributions 
to RELX Cares. The eight winners of the individual award travelled 
to London to take part in volunteering projects with RELX charity 
partners. Two other individuals and teams were given the 
opportunity to make a donation to the charity of their choice.

Each September, we hold RELX Cares Month to celebrate our 
commitment to our communities around the world. During the 
Month, over 3,300 colleagues across the Company took part in 
hundreds of volunteering and fundraising events. This included 
You Move, We Donate organised by Risk where colleagues were 
encouraged to get active in return for a company donation to 
charity; a mentoring activity for school and university students 
at Elsevier India; support for local food banks by US Legal 
colleagues; and preparing care packages for vulnerable 
women at LexisNexis South Africa.

In the wake of disasters and emergencies in the year, including 
flooding in Libya, earthquakes in Morocco and Turkey and the war 
in the Middle East, we donated approximately $150,000 to Save the 
Children; Turkish charity Ahbap; World Central Kitchen and the 
British and International Red Cross.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

2023 PERFORMANCE

Create new opportunities to engage 
remote workers in RELX cares

We extended the RELX Cares Central Donations programme 
to home-based employees encouraging them to submit 
grants for charities that they wanted to support. Until 2023 
only office-based colleagues could nominate a charity. This 
resulted in a number of applications, two of which we funded 
following a vote by RELX Cares Champions. We will continue 
to expand this engagement in 2024. 

In the year, a network of home-based Legal employees 
who wish to get involved in RELX Cares activities established 
a new network. The network is facilitated by a home-based 
LexisNexis Legal & Professional RELX Cares Champion. 
They contacted other home-based RELX employees to invite 
them to participate, learn about opportunities and to take part 
in volunteering and other RELX Cares activities. Over 230 
colleagues joined the network and so far there have been two 
activities, including volunteering at a charity that provides 
grief support to children and doing a beach clean up. 

Giving
Our central donations programme aligns with the RELX Cares 
mission. Employees serve as sponsors for charities seeking 
funding, which must in turn indicate how they meet one or more 
of RELX’s unique contributions as a business including protection 
of society and reducing inequalities, advancing science and 
improving health outcomes, furthering the Rule of Law and 
access to justice and fostering communities.

RELX Cares Champions vote on submissions using decision 
criteria such as value to the beneficiary and opportunities for 
staff engagement. In 2023, RELX Cares Champions donated 
$317,000 to 26 charities supporting over 40,000 young people. 
Projects included:

 §  Providing a programme for girls in West Bengal, India, to keep 

them in education and out of child marriage

 § Funding a Book Buzz programme to inspire pre-school children 
in remote indigenous communities in Australia to enjoy reading

 § Helping underprivileged children living in poverty-stricken 

areas of Quezon City in The Philippines

 § Expanding availability of school supplies at no cost to teachers 
and students in need at under funded schools in Dayton, Ohio

 § Offering support to vulnerable families experiencing 

challenges such as isolation, bereavement and financial 
worries in Sutton, United Kingdom

 § Supporting a weekly group intervention programme for 

pregnant and parenting teen girls in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

The LexisNexis Rule of Law Foundation’s ABCs of the Rule of 
Law colouring books teach children basic elements of the Rule of 
Law. An additional colouring book, The Rule of Law Coloring and 
Activity Book, was published in the year, aimed at older children 
to bolster their literacy skills, highlighting the main elements of 
the rule of law in contemporary society and throughout history.

Setting up a home-based RELX Cares 
network has created a wonderful 
opportunity to get to know other Florida 
home-based colleagues ensuring more 
colleagues can take advantage of using 
their RELX Cares hours to make an 
impact in their community. 

Tatiana Morales
Marketing Operations Manager, LexisNexis Legal & Professional

In managing community involvement, we apply the same rigour 
as we do to other aspects of our business. Following the B4SI 
methodology – a global standard for measuring and reporting 
corporate community investment – we conduct an annual Group 
Community Survey with RELX Accounting Services and RELX 
Cares Champions. It divides our aggregate giving into short-term 
charitable gifts, ongoing community investment and commercial 
initiatives of direct business benefit.

During the year, we worked with B4SI, where we are members, 
to ensure we effectively apply the organisation’s methodology for 
valuing in-kind contributions; B4SI subsequently assured our use 
of the methodology. Their assurance statement is available at 

 www.relx.com/additional-cr-resources.

We donated £5.7m in cash (including through matching gifts), 
and £17.7m in products, services and staff time in 2023. Some 
36% of employees were engaged in volunteering through RELX 
Cares. According to 2023 B4SI data, the average volunteering 
rate was 13.6% for our sector and 9.2% for all sectors.

36% of employees were engaged in volunteering through RELX 

Cares. According to 2023 B4SI data, the average volunteering 

rate was 13.6% for our sector and 9.2% for all sectors.

In 2023, we continued to engage in skills-based volunteering, 
applying business knowledge and expertise to benefit 
communities. For example, in the US, Risk colleagues created 
an Online Safety for Kids programme to educate parents and 
protect children. The team devoted more than 200 hours to the 
project which has been delivered to 467 Risk employees and 
approximately 1,500 parents, teachers, school administrators 
and community leaders.

Throughout 2023, we encouraged in-kind contributions, such 
as product and equipment donations, aligned with our Product 
Donation Policy (available at www.relx.com/cr-downloads). 
We also contributed over 139,000 books to Book Aid International 
(BAI) and Books for Africa worth over $11m. In addition, eight Risk 
colleagues volunteered to transcribe audio interviews that Book 
Aid International had collected from partners in Kenya in support 
of it’s new Generation Reader campaign. The 2023 Recognising 
Those Who Cares winners who travelled to London spent the day 
volunteering in the Book Aid International warehouse preparing 
books to be sent to partners.

Engagement
In 2023, we continued to provide opportunities for colleagues to 
get involved in RELX Cares. In monthly calls for RELX Cares 
Champions across the company, we shared updates about our 
local RELX Cares activities and featured guest speakers. 
Additionally, we shared RELX Cares stories in all employee 
communications throughout the year.

For a story to launch our global RELX Cares Month in September, 
we interviewed colleagues about how they used their RELX Cares 
hours to volunteer. This included serving as a museum trustee, 
volunteering at a local library and helping women and their children 
who have been displaced from their homes with practical support. 
During the Month, we ran our Global Book Drive competition. 
Employees donated nearly 2,000 books for local charities.

Jeffrey P Mladenik and Andrew Curry-Green 
Memorial Scholarship

As a lasting memorial to our colleagues Jeffrey Mladenik and 
Andrew Curry-Green, who lost their lives on 9/11, we offer 
scholarships in their name to children of eligible employees.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

Impact
In accordance with the B4SI model, we monitor the short- and 
long-term benefits of the projects with which we are involved. 
We ask beneficiaries to report on their progress to increase 
transparency and engagement.

In addition, we survey RELX Cares volunteers on the impact 
the programme has on their work following each volunteer 
activity. In 2023, we received over 17,800 responses, 90% of 
respondents said their motivation and pride in the company 
had increased as a result of volunteering and 88% said they 
had experienced a positive change in behaviour or attitude as a 
result of volunteering.

2023 PERFORMANCE

Undertake fundraising for Save The 
Children to help achieve the three year 
target of $150,000

In 2022, we announced a new three-year partnership with 
Save the Children. We have committed to raising $150,000 to 
support their work, which includes improving nutrition and 
access to school meals; preventing child labour and child 
marriage; and supporting children’s mental health. In 2022, 
the most recent year for which data is available, the Save the 
Children global movement directly supported 48.8m children 
in 116 countries around the world.

To date, we have raised over half of our total fundraising 
target. Fundraising activities included a global holiday 
sweater day, quiz nights and cause related marketing at an 
Elsevier conference in the US.

We have shared communications with colleagues about how 
our funds are benefitting children, and in the year, a member 
of the Save the Children team spoke to RELX Cares 
Champions about the impact of their work.

We have also worked with Save the Children to help focus 
our response to disasters and emergencies. 

In 2023, for the fourth year, we supported the Ban Ki-moon Centre 
for Global Citizens’ Global Citizen Scholarship Program in 
association with the Management Centre Innsbruck benefitting 
15 young African leaders. The change-makers developed their 
own SDG micro-projects using the RELX SDG Resource Centre 
to inform their work. The 2023 scholars addressed 15 SDGs 
and projects ranged from driving community awareness about 
cervical cancer in Rwanda to capturing mental health stories 
through photography in Kenya, and training young people to build 
with local construction materials for disaster risk reduction in 
Burkina Faso.

We are hugely grateful to RELX and 
their continued generous support 
with our three-year partnership. 
RELX colleagues have raised an 
incredible amount so far which is 
already having an impact and helping 
children get the future they deserve.

Supply chain

Our customers depend on us to provide them with ethically sourced and 
produced products and services. Therefore, our suppliers need to meet 
the same high standard we set for our own behaviour.

Managing an ethical  
supply chain

RELX has a diverse supply chain with suppliers located in over 
150 countries across multiple categories, including technology 
(e.g. software, cloud, hardware and telecom), indirect (e.g. 
consulting, marketing, contingent labour and travel), and direct 
(e.g. data/content and production services, print/paper/bind  
and distribution).

Given the importance of an ethical supply chain, we maintain 
a Socially Responsible Supplier (SRS) programme encompassing 
all our business areas, supported by colleagues with expertise 
in operations and procurement and a dedicated SRS Director 
from our global procurement function. 

Monitoring suppliers
We have a comprehensive Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier 
Code), available on 
 www.relx.com in 16 languages, which 
we ask suppliers to adhere to and display prominently in the 
workplace. It commits them to following applicable laws and 
best practice in areas such as human rights, labour and the 
environment. It also asks our suppliers to require the same 
standards in their supply chains, including requesting 
subcontractors to enter into a commitment to uphold the 
Supplier Code. The Supplier Code states that, where local 
industry standards are higher than applicable legal requirements, 
we expect suppliers to meet the higher standards. Our SRS 
programme is a key aspect of our work to prevent modern slavery 
and human trafficking in our supply chain as described below.

Through our SRS database, we track suppliers with whom 
we spend more than $1m annually, suppliers identified as critical 
by the company, and those located in medium- and high-risk 
countries (as designated by our third-party developed supplier 
risk tool) with a spend of $100,000 or more per year for the most 
recent consecutive two-year period. The tool incorporates  
11 indicators, including human trafficking information from  
the US State Department and Environmental Performance Index 
results produced by Yale University and Columbia University  
in collaboration with the World Economic Forum. In 2023,  
80% of our global spend was risk assessed utilising the  
supplier risk tool.

Pauline Grace Cortes
Socially Responsible Supplier 
Programme Lead
RELX

An ethical supply chain programme 
allows us to monitor the social and 
environmental practices of our 
suppliers. This helps us mitigate 
our impacts and ensure we conduct 
our business responsibly. I am proud 
to be part of an organisation that 
commits to high social standards.

Promoting human rights through the 
Supplier Code
As stated above, the Supplier Code sets out expectations for 
our suppliers’ ethical conduct.

In accordance with the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015, our Supplier 
Code specifically prohibits participation in any activity related to 
human trafficking, based on the American Bar Association’s 
Model Business Conduct Standards to Eradicate Labor Human 
Rights Impacts in Hiring and Supply Chain Practices.

In 2023, we updated our RELX Modern Slavery Act Statement 
(MSA), available from 
are working to avoid human trafficking and modern slavery  
in our direct operations and in our supply chain. 

 www.relx.com, which states how we  

The Supplier Code stipulates that, where required by law, 
suppliers will have employment contracts signed with all 
employees and requires mechanisms for reporting grievances. 
It additionally contains a provision on involuntary labour that 
states unequivocally that suppliers cannot directly or indirectly 
use, participate in, or benefit from, involuntary workers and 
human trafficking-related activities. Suppliers have access to 
Modern Slavery Awareness training through our audit provider.  
In addition, we asked all suppliers audited during the year to 
complete an e-learning course on preventing forced labour. 
We use a UK Government definition of modern slavery, 
particularly “the trafficking of people, forced labour, servitude 
and slavery.” We did not receive any reports or questions from 
employees that related to modern slavery in the year. 

The Supplier Code states, “Failure to comply with any RELX 
term, condition, requirement, policy or procedure…may result 
in the cancellation of all existing orders and termination of the 
business relationship between RELX and supplier.” It further 
states suppliers must not tolerate any retaliation against any 
employee who makes a good faith report of abuse, intimidation, 
discrimination, harassment or any violation of law or of the Supplier 
Code or who assists in the investigation of any such report.

70

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

The tracking list changes year-on-year based on the suppliers we 
engage to meet the needs of our business and/or changes in 
country risk designations within our third-party risk tool. In 2023, 
there were 796 suppliers on the SRS tracking list, 66 of which were 
in high-risk countries and 606 in medium-risk countries. 690 of 
the suppliers (87%) on the SRS tracking list have signed our 
Supplier Code, or have equivalent standards in place. The 
majority of non-signatories are new to the SRS tracking list and 
we are working with them, and other non-signatories, to gain 
agreement to our Code. In total, at the end of 2023 there were 
5,322 signatories to our Supplier Code, or suppliers with an 
equivalent code, representing an increase of 19% from 4,467 
signatories at the close of 2022.

We engage a specialist supply chain auditor to conduct audits and 
assessments on our behalf using their platform. In 2023, a total of 
125 external audits were conducted: 36 onsite and virtual onsite 
audits and 89 desktop audits. During a desktop audit, the supplier 
responds to an online questionnaire and uploads relevant 
supporting documents followed by a risk assessment using  
the third-party platform. For virtual onsite audits, facility 
representatives wear a video and audio source to allow 
remote interaction with a qualified auditor. The auditor can then 
evaluate the facility, conduct interviews, and review the necessary 
documentation in real time, just as if conducting an in-person 
audit. During an onsite audit, the auditor will select employees 
from a full roster to interview (and may select employees on the 
work floor during the facility walkthrough). Employee interviews 
are private and confidential and facility management is not 
allowed to be present. All information gathered from employee 
interviews is anonymised. When the auditor communicates 
non-compliance to facility management, they are not allowed 
to disclose information which could identify the employee or 
employees to avoid retaliation against them, which is forbidden 
in the Supplier Code.

Incidents of non-compliance trigger continuous improvement 
reports summarising audit results and remediation plans.  
The audit covers critical dimensions of the Supplier Code such 
as: labour (including child/forced labour, discrimination, 
discipline, harassment/abuse, freedom of association, labour 
contracts); wages and hours (including wages and benefits and 
working hours); health and safety (including general work facility, 
emergency preparedness, occupational injury, machine safety, 
safety hazards, chemical and hazardous material, dormitory and 
canteen); management systems (including documentation and 
records, worker feedback and participation, audits and corrective 
action process); environment (including legal compliance, 
environmental management systems, waste and air emissions); 
anti-corruption and data security. During 2023 onsite and virtual 
onsite audit locations included Argentina, India, Italy, Philippines, 
Poland, Romania, Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Africa and the 
United Kingdom.

To minimise the risks of deforestation in our production paper 
supply chain, we utilise the Forest Sourcing module of The Book 
Chain Project, a shared industry resource for sustainable paper 
we helped establish, to assess the forest sources of our papers.  
By year end 2023, 100% of RELX’s production paper was graded 
by The Book Chain Project as known and responsible (sustainable) 
sources or certified to FSC or PEFC (note: less than 0.5% not yet 
graded or certified).

During 2023 we held RELX Supplier sessions focused on the  
RELX supplier audit process and our efforts to collect and 
report CO2 emissions.

2023 PERFORMANCE

Advance Supplier Diversity and Inclusion 
Programme

We are committed to proactive engagement with suppliers 
to ensure that our supply chain reflects the diversity of our 
communities. During 2023, we continued to focus on our 
supplier diversity programme through participation in a 
Supplier Diversity Taskforce, diversity conferences, best 
practice sharing and increased internal staff support.  
In the year, 3.3% of our US spend was with veteran, minority 
or woman-owned businesses. Including small businesses, 
14.8% of total US spend was with diverse suppliers. We use 
an independent supplier diversity database to classify 
diverse suppliers.

Diverse-owned businesses interested in working with RELX 
can register on the RELX Supplier Diversity Registration 
Portal. While registration does not provide preferred 
supplier status or guarantee of business, it provides 
visibility within RELX for suppliers who can potentially fulfil 
business requirements. Find out more at:

 https://reedelsevier.service-now.com/sdpr

We aim to implement a sustainable supplier diversity and 
inclusion programme that creates value by:

 § promoting the sourcing of goods and services from 
high-performing, competitive diverse suppliers

 § monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of our efforts

 § participating in outreach programmes/activities to 

support diverse suppliers

footprint across our company and value chain.

A positive environmental impact

Our key environmental impact is through our products and services 
which help inform debate, aid decision makers and encourage 
research and development with regard to environmental issues.

The CEO is responsible to the Board for environmental 
performance; the CEOs of our business areas are responsible for 
complying with environmental policy, legislation and regulations 
and the CFO is our most senior environmental advocate. Our Chief 
Sustainability Officer and Global Head of Corporate Responsibility 
engages with the Board on environmental issues and we work 
with Environmental Champions and dedicated engineering, 
design and real estate specialists to improve efficiency wherever 
possible in our portfolio.

In 2023, we continued our support of the Climate Pledge, aiming 
to achieve net zero across all carbon scopes by 2040 at the latest. 
We have committed to measure and report greenhouse gas 
emissions, implement decarbonisation strategies for emissions 
reductions and address residual emissions with high-quality 
offsets. Details of our net zero transition road map are available 
on pages 76 and 85 .

We support progressive environmental legislation and in 2023 
continued our membership in the Aldersgate Group, an alliance 
of leaders from business, politics and civil society, chaired by 
former UK Prime Minister Theresa May, that drives action for 
a sustainable economy. In the year, we signed a letter to the British 
Prime Minister confirming our support for delivering progress on 
the UK’s net zero commitments. We hosted an event to launch a

Actual environmental data covers approximately 83% of occupied floor space based on electricity reporting. When we are unable to obtain reliable data, for example 
from small serviced offices, we estimate energy consumption and water usage on actual data from our portfolio. In this way, our reported data covers all operations, 
for which we have operational control for a 12-month period, December 2022 to November 2023. 

Scope 2 (location-based) emissions are calculated using grid average carbon emissions factors for all electricity sources. 

Scope 2 (market-based) emissions are calculated using supplier-specific carbon emissions factors (where available) for renewable energy purchases.

Our key environmental impact: 
environmental knowledge

In creating and delivering our products and services we have an 
impact on the environment in areas such as carbon emissions, 
energy and water usage. But arguably bigger and more 
important is our growing portfolio of environmental research, 
products and services, which spread good practice, encourage 
debate and aid researchers and decision makers. The most 
recent results from Scopus show our share of citations in 
environmental science represented 54% of the total. 

Risk
Climate-driven extreme weather events are increasing and pose 
a specific challenge to the insurance industry. In response to 
intensifying climate risks, insurers require data and technology 
to better assess risk. Combining geospatial information, imagery 
and historical records with predictive analytics and AI, LexisNexis 
Risk Solutions provides comprehensive data sets and analytics 
to support the industry to better understand and price risk. 
Geospatial information can provide vital information about a 
property’s likely susceptibility to flood, fire or storm damage. 
Meanwhile, aggregating comparative data can help insurers 
benchmark performance in certain regions to manage 
localised risk more effectively.

In 2023, Cirium, a Risk business unit, advanced its flight 
emissions methodology powered by EmeraldSky. This 
advancement aims to deliver a standardised and precise 
overview of carbon emissions and fuel burn calculations for 
each aircraft flight and seat. This data serves as the foundation 
for RELX’s business flight travel emissions data.

Scientific, Technical & Medical
The Lancet published their 2023 Countdown on health and 
climate change which monitors the evolving health profile of 
climate change and provides an independent assessment of 
the delivery of commitments made by governments worldwide 
under the Paris Agreement. The content, either open access or 
free to read, covers 47 indicators, drawing on the expertise of 
114 scientists and health practitioners from 52 research 
institutions and UN agencies worldwide. 

Elsevier delivered the first Sustainability Hub at the London 
Book Fair in 2023 with a stage devoted to raising awareness of 
the growing climate emergency and how the publishing industry 
can best respond. Events included a presentation on the SDG 
Publishers Compact, a keynote from London Mayor Sadiq Khan 
about making London a more sustainable city and a session 
from Book Industry Communication (BIC) on designing books 
with recycling in mind. Elsevier worked with Smart Space, 
RX’s in-house design and build service, to create a prototype 
carbon label of its stand using four main categories from  
the exhibitor perspective: stand build; venue emissions 
and water; operations (emissions from staff travel and 
accommodation); and emissions associated with the  
products displayed. 

Legal
Legal has extensive environmental law offerings for customers 
including curated daily news alerts, podcasts, law trackers 
and consultations. Specifically on climate change, tools show 
where climate change targets come from at national, European 
and international levels, climate reporting and disclosure 
frameworks, litigation and practical guidance. 

In 2023, the LexisNexis Legal and Professional Practical 
Guidance Journal featured a dedicated climate change issue 
covering topics such as sea level rise and how it affects public 
and private projects; energy security and climate change 
initiatives in the US Inflation Reduction Act; and climate change 
in M&A transactions, among others.

In the year, PatentSight, which provides curated and enriched 
patent datasets and analysis tools to advance research and 
development, competitive intelligence and benchmarking,  
and more, released a publicly available report on sustainable 
technologies linked to the SDGs. It shows, for example, among 
the largest share of patents for SDG 7, Affordable and Clean 
Energy, is hybrid vehicles and biofuels; for SDG 13, Climate 
Action, it is for GHG emissions reductions.

Exhibitions
RX’s portfolio of environmental events include World Future 
Energy Summit. Held in Abu Dhabi in January 2023, the show 
focused on critical sectors shaping sustainability and driving 
investment globally including solar; clean energy; ecowaste; 
water, and smart cities. With over 200 hours of expert content, 
the Summit’s knowledge-sharing programme was its most 
extensive and diverse to date. Over 250 speakers, including 
government officials and 166 CEOs, presidents and founders  
of leading companies, shared their insights with over 30,000 
investors, policy makers, business leaders, project owners  
and technology pioneers. 

The 2023 edition of Pollutec in Lyon, France, the international 
event for environmental and energy solutions committed to 
accelerating environmental innovation, showcased over 1,000 
exhibitors, including 200 start-ups. 420 conference sessions 
were delivered, and over 42,800 attendees came to learn, 
network and conduct business. The 2023 Pollutec Innovation 
Awards highlighted 12 finalists and rewarded three winners: 
Grims Énergie (thermal storage), MTB (li-ion battery recycling),  
and Purenat (a textile capable of destroying organic pollutants 
in the air). 

All-Energy is the UK’s largest renewables and low carbon 
showcase, held in Glasgow. It connects clean energy suppliers 
and technology providers with energy industry developers, 
buyers, investors, and policy makers. Reflecting the urgency 
required to meet UK net zero emissions targets, the 2023 event 
broke previous attendance records. Nearly 600 speakers took 
part in the free-to-attend conference, which featured 
contributions from Scotland’s First Minister, Rt Hon Humza 
Yousaf and Minister for Energy, Gillian Martin. Dcarbonise, 
another show in the RX portfolio, supported by the Scottish 
government and Energy Saving Trust, offered end-users advice 
and technology to help them decarbonise their buildings, 
businesses and transport systems.

Assessing our environmental impact
While as a non-manufacturing company our direct use of 
resources is limited, we monitor all our environmental impacts, 
and prioritise climate change, water, waste and paper use. 
Throughout 2023, we worked to reduce our direct environmental 
impact as well as upstream and downstream impacts as part of 
a lifecycle approach to our operations.

Third-party verification of our environmental data gives us 
confidence in its reliability and improves our reporting.

Environmental risks and 
opportunities

The assessment, prioritisation and mitigation of environmental 
risks are integrated into our overall company-wide risk 
management process which considers current and emerging 
risks to achieving RELX’s strategic goals. The Board assesses the 
risk level and mitigation strategies and monitors implementation 
by senior managers.

Colleagues throughout the business, as well as external 
stakeholders such as NGOs and investors, help us monitor and 
rank our environmental risks and opportunities. They are 
reviewed quarterly by the Environmental Checkpoint Committee, 
chaired by the CFO, during the year.

 www.relx.

Our Global Environmental Policy is available on 
com/cr-downloads and applies to all areas of the company and 
states that we must consider, among other risks, those that 
require legislative compliance, have significant cost implications 
for the company and/or may affect our reputation. The Global 
Environment Policy is supported by a global Environmental 
Management System (EMS), certified to the ISO 14001 
environmental standard across the group.

The EMS covers the assessment of existing and emerging 
regulatory requirements related to climate change, including 
carbon pricing, taxes and additional reporting requirements.

It includes transition and physical risks and has informed our TCFD 
report, including transitioning to a lower carbon economy and risks 
related to physical impacts of climate change. For more information 
see page 86.

Green Teams, employee-led environmental groups representing 
53% of employees in 44 key facilities, help us implement our 
EMS and achieve environmental improvements at the local level. 
We are also aided by consistent dialogue with stakeholders 
including employees, government and NGOs. We participate 
in sector initiatives, such as the Book Chain Project, and further 
our understanding through environmental benchmarking 
activities, such as CDP.

2023 PERFORMANCE

Expand climate risk assessment of 
products by the Climate Product 
Working Group

To avoid climate change of more than 1.5°C, we must quickly 
transition to a low carbon future. We aim to support our 
customers in carbon intensive sectors to decarbonise by 
providing products and services that can inform the 
transition to net zero.

We established our Climate Product Working Group 
with representatives from all our business areas to better 
understand climate risks and opportunities in the mix of 
our products and services.

Elsevier continues to focus its content and offerings toward 
scientific breakthroughs in clean energy. In 2023, Elsevier 
launched several new titles covering renewable energy, energy 
efficiency, battery technology, and decarbonisation. Of Elsevier’s 
2,900 journals, four with a traditional hydrocarbon focus were 
repositioned with updated aims to advance the UN’s sustainable 
development goals and promote a pathway to a net zero future.

Likewise, the Books team will only commission content that 
advances the energy transition and the reduction of CO2 
emissions. Among new titles in 2023 were Design and Control of 
Active Power Filters towards the Decarbonisation of Smart Grid 
Networks; Fuel Cells for Transportation: Fundamental Principles 
and Applications; and Battery Technology: From Fundamentals to 
Thermal Behavior and Management. Elsevier remained 
committed to supporting innovation in clean energy and in 2023 
held the Renewable Transformation Challenge, in collaboration 
with the International Solar Energy Society, recognising Solar 
Sister which helps women entrepreneurs in African rural 
communities run their own clean energy distribution initiatives.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

Climate change
Our Climate Change Statement supports the scientific 
community’s opinion that human activity is contributing to 
climate change; we support the Paris Agreement’s intention 
to limit climate change to 1.5°C.

The RELX Climate Change Statement is available at 

  www.relx.com/cr-downloads.

Since 2020, there has been a change in how our office space 
is utilised. This has contributed to decreases in reported 
carbon emissions. To show trends, we report data over 
a longer time sequence.

Emissions from work-related flights are calculated using 
EmeraldSky, a solution developed by Cirium within Risk. This 
innovative methodology combines comprehensive industry 
datasets with Cirium’s proprietary data to accurately determine 
the fuel consumption of individual flights. Unlike distance-based 
methodologies, the Cirium methodology powered by EmeraldSky 
recognises and highlights carbon-efficient carriers and routes, 
enabling businesses to effectively reduce their travel emissions.

See methodology notes for full details on 

 www.relx.com/additional-cr-resources.

Total Scope 1 emissions decreased by 17% in the year due to lower 
fuel consumption. Car fleet emissions have decreased 82% since 
2010 and overall Scope 1 emissions by 68% during the same period.

and maintain our internal carbon pricing scheme, among  
other measures.

We compensated for emissions in Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 
(work-related flights, hotels, cloud computing, home-based 
working and commuting) by purchasing verifiable offsets in 2023 
encompassing REDD+ forestry and peatland projects in Colombia 
and Indonesia. We do not use offsets in our carbon performance 
reporting.

Net Zero Road Map
RELX’s emissions are aligned with the 1.5°C pathway. We aim 
to maintain this performance by pursuing further emissions 
reductions in two primary ways:

1.   Company operations: We set and aim to achieve science-based 
reduction targets that bring us to net zero no later than 2040. 
Read more about our carbon reduction targets and our carbon 
performance on pages 73-81.

2.   Value chain: We will engage with our suppliers on setting and 
attaining their own science-based carbon reduction targets 
and also address emissions from other Scope 3 categories. 
Read more about how we engage with suppliers on pages 69-72.

RELX will continue to advance wider action on climate change 
through:

1.   The continued development of leading-edge products, services 

and events on climate change and net zero transition

Scope 2 (location-based) emissions decreased by 2% in the year 
due to office space consolidations, as well as lower power 
consumption at our data centres.

2.   Industry partnerships such as the Responsible Media Forum’s 
Climate Pact and Net Zero Events, an initiative for the global 
events industry

Scope 3 business travel data covers all our air travel booked and 
collected through our travel partner, BCD, and completed within 
the reporting period. While further resumption of business travel  
in 2023 led to a 7% increase in emissions over 2022, since 2019,  
we have reduced travel emissions by 58%.

Our Net Zero Commitment
As a signatory to the Climate Pledge, we are committed to 
becoming net zero by 2040 at the latest. The main tenets of the 
initiative, a community of more than 450 organisations working to 
address climate change, is measuring and reporting greenhouse 
gas emissions and implementing decarbonisation strategies for 
significant emissions reductions.

Since 2010, we have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 location-based 
carbon emissions by 75%. In 2023, our new carbon target began 
verification by the Science Based Targets Initiative. This aligns 
with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Climate Agreement and will 
require us to continue reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

3.   Climate advocacy supporting responsible climate-related 

initiatives through organisations such as the United Nations 
Global Compact, The Aldersgate Group, and RE100

4.   Sharing climate knowledge broadly through 

offerings such as the free RELX SDG Resource Centre 

 www.sdgresources.relx.com

We will continue to advance our net zero efforts through an 
internal carbon price payable by all business areas for Scope 1, 2 
and select Scope 3 emissions. The 2023 price is $35/tCO2e and 
will increase over time.

Climate objectives are monitored by the RELX CR Forum, 
chaired by the Head of Corporate Affairs, which meets twice  
per year to agree and assess progress on sustainability targets 
and objectives. Read more about CR governance on page 50.  
Executive remuneration is linked to achieving environmental 
targets including our Scope 1 and 2 carbon reduction target.

We compensated for emissions in Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 

climate change; we support the Paris Agreement’s intention 

(work-related flights, hotels, cloud computing, home-based 

to limit climate change to 1.5°C.

The RELX Climate Change Statement is available at 

  www.relx.com/cr-downloads.

Since 2020, there has been a change in how our office space 

is utilised. This has contributed to decreases in reported 

carbon emissions. To show trends, we report data over 

a longer time sequence.

Emissions from work-related flights are calculated using 

EmeraldSky, a solution developed by Cirium within Risk. This 

innovative methodology combines comprehensive industry 

datasets with Cirium’s proprietary data to accurately determine 

the fuel consumption of individual flights. Unlike distance-based 

working and commuting) by purchasing verifiable offsets in 2023 

encompassing REDD+ forestry and peatland projects in Colombia 

and Indonesia. We do not use offsets in our carbon performance 

reporting.

Net Zero Road Map

RELX’s emissions are aligned with the 1.5°C pathway. We aim 

to maintain this performance by pursuing further emissions 

reductions in two primary ways:

1.   Company operations: We set and aim to achieve science-based 

reduction targets that bring us to net zero no later than 2040.

2.   Value chain: We will engage with our suppliers on setting and 

recognises and highlights carbon-efficient carriers and routes, 

attaining their own science-based carbon reduction targets 

enabling businesses to effectively reduce their travel emissions.

and also address emissions from other Scope 3 categories. 

See methodology notes for full details on

collected through our travel partner, BCD, and completed within 

initiatives through organisations such as the United Nations 

the reporting period. While further resumption of business travel  

Global Compact, The Aldersgate Group, and RE100

in 2023 led to a 7% increase in emissions over 2022, since 2019,  

we have reduced travel emissions by 58%.

Our Net Zero Commitment

As a signatory to the Climate Pledge, we are committed to 

becoming net zero by 2040 at the latest. The main tenets of the 

initiative, a community of more than 450 organisations working to 

address climate change, is measuring and reporting greenhouse 

gas emissions and implementing decarbonisation strategies for 

significant emissions reductions.

Since 2010, we have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 location-based 

carbon emissions by 75%. In 2023, our new carbon target began 

verification by the Science Based Targets Initiative. This aligns 

with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Climate Agreement and will 

require us to continue reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

4.   Sharing climate knowledge broadly through 

offerings such as the free RELX SDG Resource Centre 

 www.sdgresources.relx.com

We will continue to advance our net zero efforts through an 

internal carbon price payable by all business areas for Scope 1, 2 

and select Scope 3 emissions. The 2023 price is $35/tCO2e and 

will increase over time.

Climate objectives are monitored by the RELX CR Forum, 

chaired by the Head of Corporate Affairs, which meets twice  

per year to agree and assess progress on sustainability targets 

and objectives. Read more about CR governance on page 50.  

Executive remuneration is linked to achieving environmental 

targets including our Scope 1 and 2 carbon reduction target. 

Read more about executive remuneration on pages 128-148.

Energy
As RELX predominantly occupies leased locations with few 
opportunities for onsite generation, we rely on green tariffs 
and renewable energy certificates (RECs) to purchase 
renewables equal to 100% of our global electricity consumption. 
In 2023, Green-e certified wind RECs were purchased from 
sources in Texas.

Energy consumption at our offices, representing around 50% 
of the total, decreased in 2023 due to ongoing office space 
consolidation. Data centre energy, representing around 40% of 
the total, decreased as we continue to move activity to the cloud.

We are a member of RE100, a global initiative bringing together 
businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity.

61%

Reduction in energy and fuels consumption since 2010

Water
The majority of our sites use water from municipal supply and are 
in developed countries with a high capability for water adaptation 
and mitigation.

Our water usage decreased 9% between 2022 and 2023 due to 
ongoing office space consolidation. 

We engage with internal water experts who produce water-
related content for our customers. In 2023, we offered customers 
24 peer-reviewed journals in water science and technology, 
including Water Research.

71%

Reduction in water use from 2010 to 2023

Scope 3
In 2023, we continued to advance our understanding of our 
Scope 3 emissions beyond business flights, identifying key 
areas, refining our methodology and our engagement with 
suppliers. We used the RELX CO2 Hub, an internal analytics 
platform, to help quantify our Scope 3 emissions.

Supply chain
We have estimated supplier emissions through an improved 
methodology by collecting data on key suppliers to derive 
carbon intensity factors. The factors are then extrapolated by 
spend category to cover our full supply chain. We estimate that 
our share of the Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions of our 
suppliers, excluding business travel (estimated separately), 
cloud computing services (see below) and events (see below), 
is approximately 65,000 tCO2e per annum.

Cloud computing services
While RELX continues to undertake energy efficiency projects 
at its own data centres, some of the energy and carbon 
reductions at these facilities have been achieved by moving 
content to third-party cloud services. With emissions data 
provided by our primary Infrastructure as a Service (laaS) 
cloud providers, we estimated 2023 market-based carbon 
emissions associated with all cloud computing services 
provided to RELX to be 178 tCO2e.

Home-based employees
Using location-specific emissions factors and office attendance 
data, we estimated emissions from home working in the year to 
be 12,498 tCO2e.

Commuting
Through RELX’s Environmental Standards programme, 
locations are encouraged to develop a local travel plan. 
Actions from travel plans include publishing information on 
public transport links, promoting commuter loan schemes 
and encouraging carpooling. Using daily refreshed office 
attendance data, we estimated emissions in 2023 to be 
4,619 tCO2e.

Events
RX has partnered with peers on Net Zero Carbon Events. 
Launched at COP27, the initiative aims to develop 
methodologies to quantify and reduce emissions associated 
with the events industry. While attendance at one of our events 
can replace the need for multiple business trips, we are 
looking to better gather emissions data associated with  
an event’s value chain, which we expect to be a sizeable 
component of our Scope 3 emissions.

RELX Environmental Challenge

2023 marked the thirteenth year of the RELX Environmental 
Challenge, a competitive grant-making scheme focused on 
providing improved and sustainable access to water and 
sanitation where it is presently at risk.

The $50,000 first prize winner was Lombrifiltro by CPlantae, 
a sanitary engineering firm and social enterprise based in 
Mexico that has developed and commercialised prefabricated 
vermifilters for onsite wastewater treatment. 

The $25,000 second prize winner was TU Delft Water For 
Impact that has developed electrocoagulation; a method to 
treat surface water using solar power and removing the need 
for costly and often hard to access chemicals. The pilot project 
will test the approach and effectiveness in providing a more 
sustainable and less chemical intensive solution to 
groundwater treatment challenges in northern Ghana.

The winners were recognised at Pollutec where they were 
invited to participate in the show’s dedicated startup space 
and pitch sessions. 

Waste
Total waste generated by our locations decreased by 27% in 
2023, primarily due to changes in how our office space is utilised. 

Of waste generated at our locations, we estimate 73% was 
recycled and 93% diverted from landfill through recycling, 
composting and energy generation from waste. Of the waste 
produced at our reporting locations, excluding estimated data, 
76% was recycled.

Where reliable measurements are not available, we calculate 
waste based on weight sampling and by counting waste containers 
leaving our premises. Although local municipalities most often 
carry out sorting and recycling, we report all waste as going 
to landfill unless we have robust evidence. For this reason, 
performance against our waste target is linked to our 
reporting locations.

It’s more than just an award; it’s an 
opportunity to make a broader impact. 
The prize money and recognition will help 
us expand our reach, providing safe water 
and sanitation to more communities 
in Mexico.

Cesar Maldonado
Co-founder of CPlantae

We do not produce any material amounts of hazardous waste. 

We continued to work toward our target to reduce waste sent to

from reporting locations, excluding estimated data, decreased 
by 38%.

We work to reduce packaging waste from our physical products. 
In the UK, we provide information on packaging waste in line with 
the UK government’s Producer Responsibility Obligations 
(Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007. As a member of the Biffpack

A new life for old equipment

We dispose of defunct hardware and other electronic 
waste according to local regulations and recycle only 
if equipment cannot be reused.

This year, we continued our partnership with Camara 
Education to donate equipment to provide access to 
computers for students in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and 
Zambia. Camara Education refurbishes our donated 
equipment and uses it, or the proceeds from selling it, 
to set up computer labs, train teachers and provide locally 
relevant educational content. Any equipment that cannot 
be refurbished is appropriately recycled.

In 2023, Camara Education generated around £25,000 
from equipment donated by RELX, enough to fully equip 
three new eLearning centres, impacting more than 2,000 
students. Our donations saved almost 2,000 tCO2e and 
kept more than nine tonnes of waste from going to landfill.

Paper
The quantity of production paper purchased in 2023 decreased 
by 21% over 2022 and by 66% since 2010 as we deliver more of  
our products online, reflecting a circular economy approach to 
conducting our business.

During 2023, we updated the RELX Paper Policy to highlight our 
commitment to avoiding deforestation and other environmental 
impacts through the purchase of sustainably sourced papers.

100% of RELX production papers were graded as known and 
responsible sources or certified to FSC or PEFC. We continue 
to reduce waste and the environmental impact of producing 
our products through measures such as smaller print runs, 
digital over litho printing, print on demand and lighter papers 
where possible.

The ongoing support we receive from 
RELX is hugely appreciated. Camara’s 
mission is to equip students with the 
digital skills they need to enable them 
to secure meaningful employment or 
pursue further education.

Aidan Tallon
CEO, Camara Education

Focus on sustainable paper
We are a founding member of the Bookchain Project’s paper 
module (PREPS) and helped create the PREPS database which 
identifies the pulps and forest sources of papers. Each paper is 
given stars according to sustainability criteria: one (unknown 
or unwanted material), three (known and responsible), or five 
(recycled, Forest Stewardship Council or Programme for the 
Endorsement of Forest Certification certified).

The grading system was initially developed by PREPS 
member Egmont UK Ltd and sustainability consultants 
Carnstone, along with input from Greenpeace and WWF.

The RELX Sustainable Production Paper Policy commits  
us to purchase only sustainable papers – graded three or five 
in Bookchain, or certified to FSC or PEFC.

In 2023, we used approximately 97 tonnes of office paper. 
To reduce paper use at sites with higher consumption levels, 
we have set specific targets.

2023 PERFORMANCE

Review global car fleet policies with the 
aim to move to more fuel-efficient vehicles

The size of the RELX car fleet has decreased by 25% since 2015, 
to less than 500 vehicles across the company. Over this period, 
fleet emissions have reduced by 65% due to the reduction in 
vehicles and improvements in vehicle performance. 

Since 2015, the number of zero or low-emission vehicle models 
in the fleet has more than quadrupled and approximately 7% of 
the fleet is fully electric (up from 0 electric vehicles in 2015).

Fleet emissions account for a minimal share of emissions of 
around 3% of the reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. 

During 2023, we conducted an analysis of approximately 80%  
of fleet vehicles through our primary global lease to better 
understand how we can best accelerate the transition to 
electric vehicles.

A survey of the remaining vehicles highlighted areas of the 
business where low-emission vehicles could be more 
effectively incorporated.

We have reported on all emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 

(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. We have included 

emissions from all RELX operating companies. Environmental data covers 

12 months from December 2022 through November 2023.

We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 

(revised edition) and the data has been assured by an independent third party.

Book donations: supporting education

While print is a relatively small portion of our revenue, we 
must continue to minimise the impact of printed product. 

We focus on techniques such as print on demand or print 
run control to better match production to demand.

We donate excess product to charity partners such as 
Book Aid International and Books for Africa to avoid 
waste and benefit communities.

In 2023, RELX donated over 139,000 books with a value 
of over $11m to our charity partners. 

Book Aid International
RELX has been a Book Aid International partner for over 
30 years through regular book donations, financial support 
and staff fundraising and volunteering. RELX donations of 
medical books are critical to educating the next generation 
of healthcare providers around the world. 

In 2023, we donated 105,109 new higher education and 
medical books, as well as a grant to help Book Aid 
International and partners create an Explorer Library at 
Chiuzira Primary School, a poorly resourced school in a 
heavily populated area in central Malawi. This library will 
help children improve their reading and learning skills 
and give them the confidence to thrive.

For over 30 years RELX and Book Aid 
International have partnered to support 
transformational change in libraries, 
schools and universities across sub-
Saharan Africa and beyond. From much 
needed medical textbooks helping to 
improve patient care to creating brand new 
school libraries like the one at Chiuzira 
Primary school in Malawi, RELX has helped 
us reach thousands of readers. As we 
approach our charity’s 70th anniversary we 
hope that together we will continue to meet 
the need for books around the world.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

CR Disclosure Standards 1
Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)

RELX makes the following disclosures, consistent with the 
recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosure (TCFD) All Sector Guidance as required 
by the UK Listing Rules (Disclosure of Climate-Related Financial 
Information) (No 2) Instrument 2021.

I. Governance
a. Board oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities
This statement has been reviewed and approved by the Board. 

The RELX Board oversees the internal controls and risk 
management practices as described on page 98. In addition, 
climate risk and opportunity is subject to our CR governance 
processes, see page 40. In the year, the Company’s approach to 
managing its climate change risks and opportunities was covered 
by the Board at multiple points including in discussions with and 
papers from the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), responsible to the 
Board for performance against climate targets; the Chief 
Sustainability Officer and Global Head of Corporate Responsibility 
(CSO); and the Head of Group Insurance and Risk, as part of  
the RELX Audit Committee review of the Company’s risk 
management process. 

The result of these undertakings is that the Board has found 
climate change has no material impact on RELX’s business in the 
short term and will be unlikely to have a significant impact in the 
medium and longer term. This is based on the review of RELX’s 
low sector exposure to climate change and consideration of 
climate change by the business in its strategy, activities, policies, 
annual budgets, and business plans, setting and monitoring of 
performance objectives, major capital expenditures, acquisitions 
and divestitures. 

Moreover, this view is predicated on strong climate action by the 
business in 2023 and over time to mitigate the effect of transition 
and physical climate change risks as described in this statement 
and in the Corporate Responsibility Report.

b.  Management’s role in assessing and managing climate-

related risks and opportunities

Management in each business area is responsible for identifying 
customer needs and developing relevant products related to 
climate change. This ranges from launching and advancing 
scientific journals with articles on climate change, energy 
efficiency, and other climate-related topics; providing data and 
analytics that support customers in reducing their environmental 
impact; providing information and analytics on laws and 
regulations related to the environment; and holding exhibitions 
focused on renewable energy and low carbon solutions. 

As RELX’s senior environmental champion, the CFO leads the 
RELX Environmental Checkpoint Group which sets strategy  
and targets for measuring and reducing the group’s own 
environmental impact. The group monitors performance 
throughout the year, tracking emissions across all scopes and 
performance relative to our target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 
(location based) carbon emissions by 46% by 2025 against a 
2015 baseline.

Management in each operational area support our environmental 
goals. They are responsible for ensuring the continuity of the 
group’s operations, including resilience to events caused by 
extreme weather events. The Business Continuity Forum brings 
together specialists from across the group to identify risks, 
assess continuity and incident response plans, learn from 
incidents and spread best practice. 

We recognise climate change intersects with other environmental 
and sustainability issues. For this reason, climate change is also 
considered by the RELX Corporate Responsibility (CR) Forum, 
with oversight by the Head of Corporate Affairs, a member of the 
executive committee, and led by the CSO. The CR Forum meets 
twice per year and comprises more than 100 participants 
including function heads and business area leads from across  
the Company. 

Management is informed about climate-issues through quarterly 
business climate reporting, the certified ISO14001 Environmental 
Management System and by engagement with internal and 
external networks.

II. Strategy
a.  Climate-related risks and opportunities in the short, 

medium, and long term 

While we are in a low carbon intensive sector, the Board and the 
Environmental Checkpoint Committee continued to consider our 
climate-related risks and opportunities based on the scenarios in 
section c below. Examples of our findings for various timeframes 
are outlined below. The long-term time horizon aligns with the 
timeframe of the Paris Climate Agreement and the medium-term 
with our ambition to achieve net zero by 2040.

Short (<10 years) – Transition risks: Policy and legal requirements 
relative to climate change will continue to increase as they have in 
recent years requiring us to ensure adequate disclosure; there 
will be increasing stakeholder pressure requiring us to ensure our 
products and services help accelerate the green transition for our 
customers in carbon intensive and other industries. Physical 
risks: Variability in weather patterns and more frequent extreme 
weather events mean we must advance both mitigation and 
adaptation strategies, including through our business continuity 
planning. See page 86 for further information on TCFD risks.

Medium (10 to 20 years) – Transition risks: There will likely be 
increased pricing of GHG emissions and enhanced reporting 
obligations, particularly in areas like supply chain emissions; 
reputational damage could result if we do not show medium-term 
results for meeting our obligations as a signatory of The Climate 
Pledge and similar initiatives. Physical risks: Gradual increase of 
average temperatures will affect businesses we operate in some 
locations more than others, so we are developing country and 
local response plans; mean temperature rise will likely affect our 
suppliers as well and we will continue our due diligence related to 
exposure in our supply chain.

average temperatures will affect businesses we operate in some 

locations more than others, so we are developing country and 

local response plans; mean temperature rise will likely affect our 

suppliers as well and we will continue our due diligence related to 

exposure in our supply chain.

Long term (20 years +) – Transition risks: Stigmatisation could 
result if our products and services are not seen as part of the 
solution to climate change; this creates an opportunity for us to 
increase offerings that support a lower carbon future. Physical 
risks: Sea level rise will be varying but worse under the business 
as usual scenario which will increase risk of business interruption 
and damage to property; we recognise that this must be part of  
our planning for the places where we will operate.

Risks and opportunities have been identified through the risk 
assessment process, as described in Governance above and 
detailed on pages 98-105, and through working groups such  
as the ESG Product Group, CR Forum and other networks.

Our carbon action hierarchy is to first, reduce our carbon 
emissions; second, to purchase increasing amounts of green 
tariff energy as availability improves in global markets where 
we operate; and third, to purchase certified renewable energy 
certificates where necessary. Our performance reporting is 
based on our gross emissions, and we also purchase high-quality, 
verified offsets for residual emissions. We offset residual 
emissions in Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 (work-related flights, 
hotels, cloud computing, home-based working and commuting) 
purchasing offsets that meet strict criteria, and which are subject 
to certification and reporting requirements. RELX is committed 
to achieving net zero emissions following our carbon action 
hierarchy across all Scopes by 2040 at the latest, including 
through our participation in The Climate Pledge. 

b.  Impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our 

business, strategy, and financial planning

In 2023, energy represented less than 1% of the RELX cost base. 
Although energy costs, and associated carbon costs, may 
increase substantially, the impact on RELX’s financial results is 
likely to remain limited and will not have a material impact on 
RELX financial planning as described in Governance above.

While we do not believe climate risk will have a material impact  
on our revenue, there is careful review within the relevant 
businesses to assess impacts of providing products and services 
that help customers with their energy transition as traditional 
sector activities may not be viable in the longer term.

We are using the climate scenarios we outline below to inform 
strategy and financial planning at both the Board and business 
area level. One example is our work with finance and other teams 
across the business to price carbon, which we raised to $35 tCO2e 
in the year (which will increase over time). Proceeds will be used 
for, among other measures, internal climate action projects 
where possible. In the year, we continued a cross-business review 
of climate-related product risks and opportunities. Printed and 
face-to-face products and events, responsible for 17% of total 
revenue, face more exposure to risks such as weather-related 
logistics disruption than do our digital offerings; see Principal 
Risks on page 98. 

We are factoring climate change into strategy planning for our 
portfolio as our scientific research information, analysis of 
environmental law, tracking of carbon and recycling markets, 
among other products and services, becomes increasingly 
important for our customers, investors and other stakeholders in 
their own responses to climate change. A small proportion of 
customers operate in carbon intensive industries, including 
agriculture and aviation, and we are committed to supporting 
them, and those in other industries, with their energy transition. 

There are no technology-related dependencies in realising 
opportunities to help customers reduce their carbon impact, 
though new opportunities may arise as technology advances.

In Risk, products such as Cirium, which serves the aviation sector,  
is deploying an improved methodology for calculating flight 
emissions; helping airlines better plan and conduct maintenance of 
their fleet to ensure efficient operation; and identifying flight routes 
for maximum occupancy so emissions per passenger are lower.

Elsevier is working to support clean energy. In 2023, it took further 
steps to implement its Energy with Purpose mission statement  
to commission only new book content that advances the energy 
transition and reduction of carbon emissions. Of 2,900 journals, 
four journals relating to hydrocarbon research remain with 
updated scope and aims focused on topics such as renewable 
energy and carbon capture and storage. Environmental science 
journals include a focus on renewable and clean energy. Among 
these are the flagship Cell Press title, One Earth, and Solar 
Compass, launched in conjunction with the International Solar 
Alliance, Joule, and new journal Nexus. The Lancet Countdown 
monitors the impact of climate change on global health.

We also continue to review our editorial boards to ensure they 
include expertise in these areas and a greater representation 
from the global south. The Elsevier Energy Books team likewise 
will only commission new content that advances emissions 
reductions and the energy transition. Elsevier discontinued 
Geofacets, an earth science tool, in 2023 and plans to discontinue 
Gulf Professional Publishing in 2024. 

LexisNexis Legal & Professional provides LexisPSL Environment 
to help clients identify environmental liabilities, understand the 
commercial implications of environmental law and keep track 
of current developments with daily news feeds on new cases, 
legislation, and consultations as well as practice notes, Q&As, 
and legal precedents. 

RX holds World Future Energy Summit, a portfolio of events 
specifically designed to combat climate change, in line with the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 
Paris Agreement. The United Arab Emirates unveiled its logo for 
the 28th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) at 2023 World 
Future Energy Summit. As part of its Net Zero Carbon Events 
commitments requiring signatories to reach net zero by 2050 at 
the latest and to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, RX was 
part of working groups to advance measurement of event-related 
emissions in the year and completed the carbon footprint of ten 
shows to better understand emissions from event energy, waste, 
production inputs and logistics. It published its net zero pathway 
report before the close of the year.

All RELX business areas are contributing content to the RELX SDG 
Resource Centre which provides free access to news, research, 
tools and events on the SDGs, including SDG 7 Clean and 
Affordable Energy and SDG 13 Climate Action. The site also 
incorporates relevant content from key partners, including the 
UN Global Compact (UNGC). In support of COP28, we released 
a climate change special issue on the RELX SDG Resource Centre, 
a curated list of 159 journal articles and book chapters to inspire 
positive environmental action and further climate research.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

c.  Resilience of the organisation’s strategy, taking into 
consideration different climate-related scenarios,  
including a 2°C or lower scenario

We have a threefold strategy to address climate-related risks:

1. Minimising our environmental impact through measures such 
as energy efficiency, renewable energy, reducing waste and 
other measures. This reduces our exposure to future legislation 
and the rising price of carbon

2.  Providing products and services which support customers 

through their transition to a low-carbon economy. We anticipate 
demand for these offerings to continue to increase over time

3.  Supporting wider action on climate change through 

collaboration, partnerships and initiatives such as the Digital 
Impact of Media Project in conjunction with the Responsible 
Media Forum, comprised of industry peers, and Bristol 
University

The Board and the Audit Committee as part of robust risk control 
measures covering our products and operations (including our 
property portfolio and supply chain) ensures management of both 
the transition and physical risks of climate change. The 
Environmental Checkpoint Committee provides data on climate 
change metrics and advice to the Board and also engages people 
throughout the business. We gain and share best practice through 
engagement with the UNGC, the Climate Pledge, Media Climate 
Pact, Net Zero Carbon Events, and the Science-based Targets 
initiative, among others. 

We have considered three possible future scenarios and 
estimated possible timeframes. They are not exact descriptions 
of an expected future, but provide an outline description of each 
based on certain assumptions. In scenarios where extreme 
weather events occur more frequently, we may see increased 
incidents that disrupt our operations, necessitating additional 
measures, with some potential cost, to ensure our operational 
resilience. However, in the context of RELX’s overall cost base, 
we would not expect any such incremental cost to be significant. 
We believe our strategy will be resilient even in the most 
challenging future scenario. 

Scenario 1: Business as usual (RCP 8.5). In this scenario, carbon 
emissions continue to increase at current rates and temperature 
increases exceed 4°C by the year 2100.

Short term: While some policies could be introduced to reduce 
carbon emissions, action is limited. Some countries may price 
carbon emissions and set standards for building and vehicle 
energy efficiency.

Medium term: The availability of renewable energy may grow, 
but the share of energy from fossil fuels will remain sizeable. 
With this level of warming, extreme and severe weather events 
will likely increase. Drought and increased precipitation will 
impact agriculture. Severe storms will interfere with our supply 
chains and logistics. The heightened need for innovation in 
climate adaptation infrastructure may increase demand for 
our environmental products and services for the scientific, 
technical and other communities.

Long term: Rising sea levels will affect land use of coastal 
and low-lying regions where we may have operations, requiring 
investment to protect or relocate key company facilities to 
ensure business continuity. Significant government investment 
will be required to mitigate the impacts, for example in 
strengthening flood and coastal defences or securing reliable 
water supplies, with follow-on effects for places where we and 
future customers operate.

Political instability in some regions may increase as populations 
compete for resources such as fresh water supplies and as large 
numbers of people move from regions most heavily impacted by 
climate change. Global economic uncertainty will likely become 
the norm, with limited growth at best and decline at worst. 
There will likely be significant health impacts as well. As 
impacts become more apparent, public sentiment may favour 
organisations such as RELX that have taken action to limit 
the impact of climate change.

We would continue to pursue measures such as science-based 
carbon reductions, implementation of innovative technological 
solutions, carbon sequestration and (re)forestation, but without 
the catalyst of global government investment in these areas.

Scenario 2: 2°C climate change (RCP 2.6). In this scenario, carbon 
emissions are halved by 2050 and climate change does not exceed 
2°C by the year 2100.

Short term: Countries would introduce more challenging carbon 
targets as they update their Nationally Determined Contributions 
under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. A range of new policies 
would most likely be introduced across many countries to control 
carbon emissions including carbon pricing, higher standards on 
building and vehicle energy efficiency, with increased renewable 
energy generation in global power grids. Such developments will 
be reflected in our policies and procedures, and could increase  
the demand for our climate-related products and services. 

Medium term: There would likely be public and private 
investment in greater carbon sequestration, capture and storage, 
(re)forestation, and other measures – all of which would aid action 
in these areas within our business.

Long term: The frequency of extreme weather events will increase 
but not as much as under Scenario 1. There will still be disruption 
to transport and logistics through storms, but sea level rise will be 
more limited, as will costs we may face associated with adaptation 
and mitigation projects. With reduced climate impacts, political 
and economic instability will be lessened. Climate-related 
migration will still be a factor but to a smaller degree than 
anticipated under Scenario 1.

Scenario 3: 1.5°C climate change (RCP1.9). In this scenario, 
to achieve a 66% chance of avoiding more than 1.5°C warming 
by 2100, inclusive and sustainable development will be a key 
consideration for policy makers with high levels of 
international cooperation.

Short term: Emissions must peak before 2025 to achieve net zero 
emissions by 2050, These ambitious carbon reductions would be 
supported by new policies (with carbon prices reaching as much 
or more than four times the price under the 2°C scenario) and 
strong regulation.

Medium term: Buildings will be subject to tougher standards to 
achieve carbon reductions of nearly three times those under the 
2°C degree scenario. Energy costs and associated carbon costs 
could be higher than in Scenario 1 or 2, but this is unlikely to have  
a major impact for RELX as energy is not a significant part of our 
cost base as indicated above.

The transport sector will see significant change, with the majority 
of vehicles powered by alternative sources. Nature-based 
solutions to climate change, such as forestation, are also likely 
to play an important role. In this scenario, RELX efforts to reduce 
emissions, seek technology-driven carbon solutions and the 
pursuit of nature-based decarbonisation will be magnified.

Environmental Checkpoint Committee provides data on climate 

change metrics and advice to the Board and also engages people 

throughout the business. We gain and share best practice through 

engagement with the UNGC, the Climate Pledge, Media Climate 

Pact, Net Zero Carbon Events, and the Science-based Targets 

initiative, among others.

Short term: Countries would introduce more challenging carbon 

targets as they update their Nationally Determined Contributions 

under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. A range of new policies 

would most likely be introduced across many countries to control 

carbon emissions including carbon pricing, higher standards on 

building and vehicle energy efficiency, with increased renewable 

energy generation in global power grids. Such developments will 

be reflected in our policies and procedures, and could increase  

the demand for our climate-related products and services.

investment in greater carbon sequestration, capture and storage, 

(re)forestation, and other measures – all of which would aid action

and oil will drop to very low levels by 2060, which may impact 
the energy costs paid by RELX. After 2050, technologies such 
as bioenergy and carbon capture and storage will need to be 
widespread to remove excess carbon from the atmosphere 
to ensure emissions are net negative.

III. Risk management
a.  Our processes for identifying and assessing climate-

related risks

The principal and emerging risks facing the business, which have 
been assessed by the Audit Committee and Board, are described 
on pages 98-105. The Directors have considered the risk of climate 
change to the business, including the positive contribution that 
RELX makes through activities such as supporting academic 
research, pricing recyclable materials, and enabling customers 
to access our products electronically.

Climate-related risks are assessed as part of the RELX risk 
management process. Risks are formally reviewed every six 
months. Each risk is assigned a significance based on the potential 
impact to revenue and the likelihood of that risk being realised. 
As part of our Environmental Management System, climate risk 
assessment covers transition and physical risks as described 
above and below, and also includes the assessment of existing 
and emerging regulatory requirements related to climate change. 
These include carbon pricing schemes, taxes and additional 
reporting requirements. 

b.  Our processes for managing climate-related risks
Climate change responsibilities are assigned to key roles, 
including the CFO at the executive level. Performance is 
monitored and evaluated throughout the year by the 
Environmental Checkpoint Group, chaired by the CFO, and 
new programmes are introduced as required to control 
climate-related transition and physical risks. 

On legislative and product trends, we gain insights through our 
Government Affairs teams, external fora such as the Aldersgate 
Group, and ISO 14001 environmental certification of our EMS. We 
speak with experts in the business, our climate-related Employee 
Resource Groups including Green Teams and Elsevier’s Climate 
Board, and learn through industry specific networks such as the 
Responsible Media Forum’s Climate Pact and cross-sector 
networks like the CR and Sustainability Council of the Conference 
Board, where our CSO serves on the Executive Committee. 

The business continuity programme, under the direction of the 
RELX Business Continuity Forum, oversees mitigations of climate 
change physical risks on our operations through business 
continuity plans which include remote working and detailed 
employee information.

We mitigate potential climate-related risks on our supply 
chain through supplier management practices in the Global 
Procurement team, the Supplier Resiliency Working Group, 
the Business Continuity Forum and the Socially Responsible 
Supplier programme, which includes supplier engagement on 
their activities and policies, and a risk-based programme of 
supplier audits and remediation.

High-level net zero roadmap
RELX carbon emissions are in line with the reductions required 
to ensure climate change of no more than 1.5ºC.

To achieve net zero across all Scopes by 2040 at the latest, we 
are following a broad programme of action to achieve further 
reductions. This will include developing products and services 
that support the transition to a net zero economy, alongside 
actions to reduce our emissions.

Short term
 § Continue office space consolidation in line with the working 

preferences of colleagues

 § Migration from owned data centres to more energy efficient 

third party cloud providers

 § Purchase of renewable energy equal to RELX’s global 

electricity consumption

 § Continue to quantify and report on Scope 3 emissions from our 

supply chain and value chain

 § Engage suppliers to adopt 1.5ºC aligned carbon reduction targets

 § Purchase of high quality carbon offsets to equal our residual 

emissions

Medium term
 § Transition company car fleet to zero emission (e.g. electric) 

vehicles

 § RELX renewable energy purchases in more markets

 § Encourage purchase of renewable energy by suppliers

Longer term
 § Purchase of carbon neutralisation offsets for residual 

emissions

IV. Metrics and targets
We aim to provide additional insight into revenue from products 
and services designed for a low carbon economy in subsequent 
disclosures. Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions reduction 
targets and energy reduction targets are set out on page 80 of this 
report. The remuneration of the CEO and the CFO is linked to the 
achievement of environment targets. These included in 2023, 
a key performance objective to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 
(location-based) carbon emissions by 40% against a 2015 
baseline, with 61% achievement and to reduce energy and  
fuel consumption by 27% against a 2015 baseline, with 49% 
achievement. See page 132 for further details. 

In the year, we reported performance against our $3bn committed 
bank facility which has pricing linked to three sustainability 
performance targets. In each year, the cost of the facility is 
reduced if two or more sustainability targets are achieved and 
increased if two or more of the targets are missed. The targets 
relate to carbon emissions reduction, as well as increasing the 
unique users and the amount of content available on the RELX SDG 
Resource Centre. All three targets were achieved. See page 49.

TCFD Risks
We have considered climate-related risk areas detailed in the TCFD guidance as detailed below. While we do not believe climate-related 
risks will have a material impact on our business, we have highlighted risks areas which present the most opportunity for us to support 
the net zero transition.

Increased pricing of GHG 
emissions: The rapid 
transition to a low carbon 
energy system could require 
higher energy prices and a 
higher carbon price to 
disincentivise the use 
of fossil fuels

Enhanced emissions-
reporting obligations: 
An increasing number of 
governments are likely to 
impose requirements on 
business to achieve the low 
carbon transition. New 
requirements are likely to 
include additional reporting 
and transparency 
requirements for 
GHG emissions

Mandates and regulation 
affecting existing products 
and services: New 
regulations may be 
introduced for products to 
support the transition to a 
low-carbon economy

Technology Substitution of existing 

products and services with 
lower emissions options

RELX has low exposure to energy and carbon pricing (less than  
1% of total spend) and has achieved significant reductions in 
energy consumption since 2010. For this reason, moderate to 
significant increases in energy costs will have a limited impact 
on RELX.

RELX has processes in place for carbon reporting and 
disclosure aligned with various best practice frameworks. 
Additional reporting requirements are expected to have 
insignificant financial implications. 

Widespread introduction of different reporting regimes in 
the countries where we operate could increase the risk of 
non-compliance (and therefore the risk of fines). However, 
RELX operates an environmental management system 
certified to ISO 14001 which requires a compliance 
assessment with environmental legislation. This reduces the 
risk of non-compliance with future reporting regulations.

RELX delivers products and service primarily in three ways: i) 
online/digital; ii) printed products; iii) in-person events. Increasing 
regulation on products in these areas could result in an increased 
cost for providing those products and services.

Online/digital: Products served by RELX-owned data centres are 
covered by the purchase of renewable electricity and RELX’s net 
zero commitment. RELX is engaging with Scope 3 suppliers for 
greater transparency on our share of their carbon emissions and 
renewable energy.
Printed products: Revenue from printed products has decreased 
significantly since 2010 as more product offerings are made 
online. Paper used in RELX’s printed products complies with the 
RELX Sustainable Paper Policy which requires all papers are 
from known and sustainable sources and/or certified to a 
recognised standard.
In person: Exhibitions is part of an events industry initiative, 
Net Zero Carbon Events, working to achieve net zero by 2040. 
This commitment requires significant reductions in carbon 
emissions and partnerships with other industries to minimise 
events-related emissions. 
A small proportion of our customers operate in carbon-intensive 
industries, and less than 1% of the journals we produce 
specifically cover content related to hydrocarbon; we continue 
to ensure they focus on supporting relevant customers in their 
energy transition.

RELX has largely transitioned from printed physical products 
to online/digital products and services. This avoids the 
emissions associated with the manufacture and distribution 
of printed products but introduces emissions associated with 
the use of data centres for the digital offerings.
RELX-owned data centres are covered by renewable 
electricity and RELX’s net zero commitment. As described, 
we are engaging with our cloud providers for greater 
transparency on carbon emissions and renewable energy.

There will be an increased need for 
information on energy and carbon 
pricing; research on energy 
transition and zero carbon; and 
events which bring stakeholders 
together to showcase related 
technological innovation are likely 
to increase the demand for 
RELX products and services.

As new regulations are introduced, 
there will be a greater need for 
guidance; this could result in an 
increased demand for our risk, 
science, legal and other products 
and services.

New regulations on products will, 
in many cases, be best addressed 
through industry collaboration. 
Our convening power in the 
markets we serve can support 
such industry collaboration.

Our products, services and events 
aid the low-carbon transition 
benefiting our customers and 
society.

Costs to transition to lower 
emissions technology

The cost implications for transitioning to new technology 
are primarily in our supply chain.

Printed products are manufactured and distributed by 
suppliers on behalf of RELX. RELX engages its suppliers 
through the Socially Responsible Suppliers programme 
and has processes in place for reporting on its supply 
chain-related emissions.

Detailed energy and carbon market 
insights we can provide through our 
products, services and events will 
allow companies to better assess 
the risks and costs of transitioning 
to lower emissions technologies.

Uncertainty in market

Increased cost of 
raw materials: Low-carbon 
requirements on the use, 
and distribution, of raw 
materials could lead to an 
increase in their cost

Reputation Shifts in consumer 

preferences

Significant increases to the cost of air travel due to the 
factoring in of carbon charges may discourage business travel 
in favour of virtual meetings. This could lead to a reduction in 
the number of attendees at in-person events affecting our 
events business. We offer virtual attendance options and 
in-person participation allows exhibitors and attendees to 
hold numerous meetings during one event.

The ability for an exhibitor or event 
attendee to maximise engagement 
by attending one event, for example, 
with customers, prospects, and 
suppliers, can become more 
valuable as the cost of travel 
increases.

As businesses take action to combat climate change, they 
might need to change business models or practices to ensure 
their success in a low-carbon economy. Some of these 
changes may raise questions for investors or other 
stakeholders and reduce visibility of the business’s strategy. 
RELX provides detailed and transparent disclosure on climate 
change to provide clarity to investors and other stakeholders.

RELX does not manufacture products from raw materials. 
An increase in the cost of raw materials would primarily 
impact RELX via higher prices in our supply chain.

Businesses can develop new 
disclosures to effectively 
communicate plans with 
stakeholders. The demand for our 
products which provide company 
and market insights could grow as 
investors’ requirements for reliable 
information and data increases.

Pricing insights in key supply chains 
such as chemicals and plastics are 
provided within our Risk business. 
If cost and price volatility increases, 
there could be a greater demand for 
such products and services.

Business customers may become more aware of 
environmental concerns and expect a high standard of 
performance from companies. Over time, this may lead to a 
decrease in demand for carbon intensive products as 
consumers move to low emission alternatives.

While we do not produce consumer 
products, we do serve a variety of 
industries and can support their 
efforts to decarbonise through our 
products, services and events.

RELX sets environmental targets on a five-year cycle and 
has a Science Based Target aligned carbon reduction target 
which aligns its emissions reductions with those required to 
meet the 1.5°C ambition of the Paris Agreement.

RELX operates a comprehensive business continuity 
programme to ensure colleagues can work remotely and be 
informed should a location be impacted by severe weather 
conditions. This allows the business to function despite the 
impact of the severe weather. As risks associated with 
weather events increases, insurance premiums paid by 
RELX could increase.

Printed products require supply of wood from sustainable 
forest sources. Changes in precipitation and weather patterns 
could disrupt the growth in forest sources known to be 
sustainably managed which could increase the price of 
sustainable paper. RELX has flexibility in the types of paper 
used and the forest sources of these papers which allows 
purchases to be made elsewhere should the need arise.  
As a member of the Book Chain Project, we assess the 
sustainability of a large number of papers, allowing us to 
consider alternatives.

Climate change will affect temperatures differently in 
different locations. This means that, over time, the operation 
of some offices will become less efficient as they may need to 
maintain physical working conditions close to or outside the 
range for which they were designed. This could lead to an 
increase in operational costs as more energy will be required 
for cooling.

If sea levels rise significantly there is increased risk of 
property damage to any RELX locations in low-lying coastal 
regions. This could increase insurance premiums or disrupt 
the working arrangements of colleagues in those locations. 
We have a comprehensive business continuity programme in 
place to mitigate such impacts and consider climate risk in the 
siting of our offices.

Industries which face the greatest 
challenges in decarbonisation will 
need support, information and 
tools. We will continue developing 
new products and services to assist 
these industries in their 
decarbonisation efforts.

Maintaining good environmental 
performance provides a 
reputational benefit with our 
stakeholders, including investors. 
Strong environmental performance 
and commitments may be reflected 
in improved or lower cost financing.

We provide products that help to 
assess and quantify insurance 
perils. As insurance premiums 
increase, demand for these 
products will likely grow as 
insurance providers seek more 
accurate weather-related risk 
assessments.

We offer products that use data 
analytics to help increase the 
efficiency of land use in areas such 
as water consumption. Demand for 
such products could grow as a 
response to decreasing yields due 
to weather.

Rising mean temperatures will 
require government to review, and 
businesses to implement, new 
building standards and guidelines. 
Our business areas would produce 
guidance to assist customers to 
interpret associated new standards 
and planning regimes.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Corporate responsibility

Independent Assurance Statement  
to RELX PLC Management

Scope
We have been engaged by RELX plc (“RELX”) to perform a ‘limited 
assurance engagement,’ as defined by International Standards on 
Assurance Engagements, here after referred to as the “engagement”, 
to report on RELX’s corporate responsibility data indicated with a ‘^’ 
symbol (the “Subject Matter”) contained within RELX’s Annual Report 
for the year ended 31st December 2023 (the “Report”).

This data is reported under the following headings in the Report:

 § People
 § Health and safety (lost time) 
 § Socially Responsible Suppliers (SRS)
 § Environment 
 § Climate change 
 § Paper
 § SDG Resource Centre

 § Cyber security

 § Helping our people pursue the highest ethical standards

Other than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out 
the scope of our engagement, we did not perform assurance 
procedures on the remaining information included in the Report, and 
accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on this information.

Criteria applied by RELX
In preparing the Subject Matter, RELX applied their corporate 
responsibility reporting guidelines, comprising the ‘RELX Reporting 
Guidelines and Methodology 2023’ (Criteria), which is available on the 
RELX website.

RELX’s responsibilities
RELX’s management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for 
presenting the Subject Matter in accordance with that Criteria, in all 
material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and 
maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and 
making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the subject 
matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.

EY’s responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the 
Subject Matter based on the evidence we have obtained.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International 
Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000 (Revised)’) and the 
terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with RELX on 11th 
January 2024.This standard requires that we plan and perform our 
engagement to express a conclusion on whether we are aware of any 
material modifications that need to be made to the Subject Matter in 
order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. 
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on 
our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate  
to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion.

Our Independence and Quality Management
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met 
the requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, 
and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this 
assurance engagement.

EY also applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, 
Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of 
Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
engagements, which requires that we design, implement and operate 
a system of quality management including policies or procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Description of procedures performed 
Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in 
nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable 
assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained 
in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the 
assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain 
a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not 
provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable 
level of assurance.

Although we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal 
controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures,  
our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on 
internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or 
performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation 
of data within IT systems.

A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily 
of persons responsible for preparing the Subject Matter and related 
information, and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures.

Our procedures included:

Performed detailed testing on the ESG Data Sets and carried out the 
following activities to assess the Subject Matter:

a. Conducted interviews with key personnel to understand the process 
for collecting, collating and reporting the Subject Matter during the 
reporting period;

b. Reviewed certain documentation related to guidance and training for 
the Subject Matter, and minutes outlining relevant initiatives;

c. Undertook analytical review procedures to understand the 
appropriateness of the data;

d. Performed testing, on a sample basis, against underlying source 
information to check the accuracy and completeness of the data and the 
appropriate application of the Criteria;

e. Understood global estimation methodology to determine how it 
should be applied correctly and consistently;

f. Assessed the Report for the appropriate presentation of the data, 
including limitations and assumptions.

We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary 
in the circumstances.

Emphasis of matter
RELX reported 100% of its electricity purchased from renewable 
sources for 2023, relying on green tariffs and renewable energy 
certificates (RECs). However, it should be noted that, for 2023, 20% of 
this percentage reported related to US RECs that have been applied to 
countries outside the United States. This means that the location of the 
purchased RECs differs from the location where they have been applied. 
This does not affect our conclusion as set out below.

Conclusion
Based on our procedures and the evidence obtained, we are not aware of 
any material modifications that should be made to the Subject Matter for 
the year ended 31st December 2023 in order for it to be in accordance with 
the Criteria.

Use of Our Assurance Statement 
We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this 
assurance report or its conclusions to any persons other than RELX, or 
for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared. Accordingly, 
we accept no liability whatsoever, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, 
to any third party for any consequences of the use or misuse of this 
assurance report or its conclusions.

RELX uses adjusted and underlying figures as additional performance measures. Adjusted figures primarily exclude the amortisation of acquired intangible 

assets and other items related to acquisitions and disposals, and the associated deferred tax movements. Reconciliations between the reported and adjusted 

figures are set out on pages 222 to 230. Underlying growth rates are calculated at constant currency, excluding the results of acquisitions until 12 months after 

purchase, and excluding the results of disposals and assets held for sale. Underlying revenue growth rates also exclude exhibition cycling. Constant currency 

growth rates are based on 2022 full-year average and hedge exchange rates. 

Acquisition-related costs were £56m (2022: £62m).  

The adjusted tax charge was £553m (2022: £530m). The adjusted

historical tax matters. The adjusted tax charge excludes

Capital expenditure was £477m (2022: £436m), including £447m 
(2022: £400m) in respect of capitalised development costs, 
reflecting sustained investment in new products. Capital 
expenditure was 5.2% of revenue (2022: 5.1%) and excludes pre-
publication costs of £93m (2022: £94m) that were capitalised as 
current assets and principal lease repayments under IFRS 16 of 
£70m (2022: £78m). Depreciation and other amortisation charged 
within adjusted operating profit was £514m (2022: £491m)  
and represented 5.6% of revenue (2022: 5.7%). This includes 
amortisation of internally developed intangible assets of £330m 
(2022: £309m) and depreciation of property, plant and equipment of 
£43m (2022: £47m) which combined represent 4.1% (2022: 4.2%) 
of revenue. 

Interest paid (net) was £294m (2022: £165m), increasing as a result 
of higher interest rates. Tax paid of £619m (2022: £495m) was 
higher than the income statement charge, with the difference 
reflecting timing of tax payments. 

In 2023, the cash outflow relating to Exhibitions exceptional costs 
charged in 2020 was £5m (2022: £25m). Payments made in respect 
of acquisition-related items amounted to £56m (2022: £54m). 

Free cash flow before dividends was £1,988m (2022: £1,970m). 
Ordinary dividends paid to shareholders in the year, being the 2022 
final dividend and 2023 interim dividend, amounted to £1,059m 
(2022: £983m). Free cash flow after dividends was £929m 
(2022: £987m).

Funding 
Debt 
Net debt at 31 December 2023 was £6,446m, a decrease of £158m 
since 31 December 2022. The majority of our borrowings are 
denominated in US dollars and euros, and as sterling was stronger 
against the US dollar and euro at the end of the year, our net 
borrowings decreased when translated into sterling. Excluding 
currency translation effects, net debt increased by £26m. 
Expressed in US dollars, net debt at 31 December 2023 was 
$8,251m, an increase of $260m since 31 December 2022. 

Gross debt of £6,497m (2022: £6,730m) is comprised of bank and 
bond borrowings of £6,356m (2022: £6,548m) and lease liabilities 
under IFRS 16 of £141m (2022: £182m). The fair value of related 
derivative liabilities was £108m (2022: £213m), finance lease 
receivables totalled £4m (2022: £5m) and cash and cash 
equivalents totalled £155m (2022: £334m). In aggregate, these 
give the net debt figure of £6,446m (2022: £6,604m). 

The effective interest rate on gross bank and bond borrowings was 
4.6% in 2023 (2022: 2.9%). Excluding the charge relating to the 
early bond redemption it was 4.2%. As at 31 December 2023, gross 
bank and bond borrowings had a weighted average life remaining 
of 4.1 years and a total of 57% of them were at fixed rates, after 
taking into account interest rate derivatives. The ratio of net debt 
(including pensions) to EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation) was 2.0x (2022: 2.1x), 
calculated in US dollars. 

At 31 December 2023, there was a net negative accounting 
balance (pension assets less pension obligations) of £63m, 
largely unchanged from the net negative position of £55m as  
at 31 December 2022.  

Liquidity 
In June 2023, €750m of euro denominated term debt was issued 
with a coupon of 3.75% and a maturity of eight years. The Group 
has ample liquidity and access to debt capital markets, providing 
the ability to repay or refinance debt as it matures and to fund 
ongoing requirements. This includes access to a $3bn committed 
bank facility which provides security of funding for short-term 
debt, and which is undrawn. In March 2023 the maturity date of the 
facility was extended to April 2026. The facility has pricing linked to 
three ESG performance targets, all of which were achieved in 2023. 

Invested capital and returns 
Net capital employed decreased by £700m to £10,389m at  
31 December 2023 (2022: £11,089m), primarily due to changes  
in exchange rates. The carrying value of goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets decreased by £693m due to the changes in 
exchange rates. An amount of £64m (2022: £125m) was capitalised 
in the year in respect of acquired intangible assets and £68m 
(2022: £269m) was recorded as goodwill.  

These additions were offset by amortisation and impairment of 
acquired intangible assets.

The post-tax return on average invested capital in the year was

+8% 

54.6p     58.8p    

The final dividend proposed by the Board is 41.8p per share. 
This gives total dividends for the year of 58.8p (2022: 54.6p), 8% 
higher than the prior year. 

The dividend policy of RELX PLC is, over the longer term, to 
grow dividends broadly in line with adjusted earnings per share, 
paying out approximately half of adjusted earnings in dividend 
each year. 

During 2023, a total of 30.9m RELX PLC shares were 
repurchased at an average price of 2,588p. Total 
consideration for these repurchases was £800m. A further 
2.0m (2022: 2.2m) shares were purchased by the Employee 
Benefit Trust. As at 31 December 2023, total shares in issue, 
net of shares held in treasury and shares held by the Employee 
Benefit Trust, amounted to 1,881.5m. A further 4.6m shares 
have been repurchased in 2024 as at 14 February. 

Distributable reserves and parent 
company balance sheet 
As at 31 December 2023, RELX PLC had distributable reserves 
of £6.5bn (2022: £6.5bn). In line with UK legislation, distributable 
reserves are derived from the non-consolidated RELX PLC 
balance sheet. The consolidated reserves reflect adjustments 
such as the amortisation of acquired intangible assets that are 
not taken into account when calculating distributable reserves. 

The parent company balance sheet net assets are higher than 
those of the Group due to the investment in RELX Group plc 
being carried at a value of £18.3bn which is not reflected on the 
consolidated balance sheet. The parent company balance sheet 
can be found on page 214. Further information on the 
distributable reserves can be found in the parent company 
financial statements on page 215. 

Alternative performance measures 
RELX uses a range of alternative performance measures 
(APMs) in the reporting of financial information, which are not 
defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
such as IFRS. These APMs are used by the Board and 
management as they believe they provide relevant information 
in assessing the Group’s performance, position and cash flows, 
enable investors to track more clearly the core operational 
performance of the Group, and provide a clear basis for 
assessing RELX’s ability to raise debt and invest in new 
business opportunities. 

Management also uses these financial measures, along  
with IFRS financial measures, in evaluating the operating 
performance of the Group as a whole and of the individual 
business areas. These measures should not be considered  
in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information 
presented in compliance with IFRS. The measures may not  
be directly comparable to similarly reported measures by  
other companies. 

Definitions of alternative performance measures can be found

Accounting policies 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with UK adopted International Accounting 
Standards in conformity with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) following the accounting policies shown 
in the notes to the financial statements on pages 166 to 212.  
The accounting policies and estimates which require the  
most significant judgement relate to the capitalisation of 
development spend and accounting for defined benefit 
pension schemes.  

Further detail is provided in the accounting policies on

Tax Principles 
Taxation is an important issue for us and our stakeholders, 
including our shareholders, governments, customers, 
suppliers, employees and the global communities in which we 
operate. We have set out our approach to tax in our global tax 
strategy. This incorporates our Tax Principles along with 
additional disclosures around where we pay taxes and our 
broader contribution to society. This is all made publicly 
available on our website: 
We maintain an open dialogue with tax authorities, and are 
vigilant in ensuring that we comply with current tax legislation. 
We have clear and consistent tax policies and tax matters are 
dealt with by a professional tax function, supported by external 
advisers. We proactively seek to agree arm’s-length pricing 
with tax authorities to mitigate tax risks of significant cross-
border operations. We actively engage with policy makers, tax 
administrators, industry bodies and international institutions to 
provide informed input on proposed tax measures, so that we 
and they can understand how those proposals would affect our 
business. In addition, we participate in consultations with the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD), European bodies and the United Nations.

The final dividend proposed by the Board is 41.8p per share. 

This gives total dividends for the year of 58.8p (2022: 54.6p), 8% 

higher than the prior year. 

The dividend policy of RELX PLC is, over the longer term, to 

grow dividends broadly in line with adjusted earnings per share, 

paying out approximately half of adjusted earnings in dividend 

each year. 

During 2023, a total of 30.9m RELX PLC shares were 

repurchased at an average price of 2,588p. Total 

consideration for these repurchases was £800m. A further 

2.0m (2022: 2.2m) shares were purchased by the Employee 

Benefit Trust. As at 31 December 2023, total shares in issue, 

net of shares held in treasury and shares held by the Employee 

Benefit Trust, amounted to 1,881.5m. A further 4.6m shares 

have been repurchased in 2024 as at 14 February. 

Distributable reserves and parent 

company balance sheet 

As at 31 December 2023, RELX PLC had distributable reserves 

of £6.5bn (2022: £6.5bn). In line with UK legislation, distributable 

reserves are derived from the non-consolidated RELX PLC 

balance sheet. The consolidated reserves reflect adjustments 

such as the amortisation of acquired intangible assets that are 

not taken into account when calculating distributable reserves. 

The parent company balance sheet net assets are higher than 

those of the Group due to the investment in RELX Group plc 

can be found on page 214. Further information on the 

distributable reserves can be found in the parent company 

financial statements on page 215. 

Alternative performance measures 

RELX uses a range of alternative performance measures 

(APMs) in the reporting of financial information, which are not 

defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 

such as IFRS. These APMs are used by the Board and 

management as they believe they provide relevant information 

in assessing the Group’s performance, position and cash flows, 

enable investors to track more clearly the core operational 

performance of the Group, and provide a clear basis for 

assessing RELX’s ability to raise debt and invest in new 

business opportunities. 

Management also uses these financial measures, along  

with IFRS financial measures, in evaluating the operating 

performance of the Group as a whole and of the individual 

business areas. These measures should not be considered  

in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information 

presented in compliance with IFRS. The measures may not  

be directly comparable to similarly reported measures by  

other companies. 

Definitions of alternative performance measures can be found 

on pages 222 to 230 

Accounting policies 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in 

accordance with UK adopted International Accounting 

Standards in conformity with the requirements of the 

Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting 

Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting 

Standards Board (IASB) following the accounting policies shown 

in the notes to the financial statements on pages 166 to 212.  

The accounting policies and estimates which require the

Treasury policies 
The Board of RELX PLC agrees policies for managing  
treasury risks. The key policies address security of funding 
requirements, the target fixed/floating interest rate exposure 
for debt and foreign currency hedging and place limits on 
counterparty exposures. A more extensive summary of these 
policies is provided in note 17 to the financial statements on 
pages 194 to 200. Financial instruments are used to finance 
the RELX businesses and to hedge transactions. The Group’s 
businesses do not enter into speculative transactions. 

Liquidity management 
The capital structure is managed to support RELX’s objective of 
maximising long-term shareholder value through appropriate 
security of funding, ready access to debt and capital markets, 
cost-effective borrowing and flexibility to fund business and 
acquisition opportunities while maintaining appropriate 
leverage to ensure an efficient capital structure. 

Over the long term, RELX seeks to maintain cash flow 
conversion of 90% or higher and credit rating agency metrics 
that are consistent with a solid investment grade credit rating. 
These metrics, as defined by the rating agencies, include net 
debt to EBITDA and various measures of cash flow as 
a percentage of net debt. Further detail on liquidity 
management is provided on pages 195 and 196. 

Capital management 
RELX uses the cash flow it generates to fund capital 
expenditure required to drive organic growth, to make selective 
acquisitions and to provide a growing dividend to shareholders, 
while retaining balance sheet strength to maintain access to 
cost-effective sources of borrowing. Share repurchases are 
undertaken to maintain an efficient balance sheet. Further 
detail on capital management is provided on pages 194 and 195. 

Corporate responsibility 
Our focus on corporate responsibility continues to underpin 
our activities. This included in 2023, achieving the 
environmental targets we had set for 2025. We continue to 
hold group-wide certification of our Environmental 
Management System.   

To track our environmental progress through the year,  
I led quarterly Environmental Checkpoint meetings with 
senior managers. We have established a working group to 
advance our Net Zero Carbon Events commitments and our 
Exhibitions business has published a net zero roadmap. For 
World Environment Day, I sent a message to all RELX staff 
highlighting our environmental performance and priorities, 
building on the work of Green Teams at 44 locations across 
the group focused on environmental management at the 
local level.  

Our most significant contribution to the environment-related 
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 7, 
Clean And Affordable Energy and SDG 13, Climate Action, 
remains our products and services. In 2023, we deployed the 
EmeraldSky methodology developed by Risk’s global flight 
data business, Cirium, to calculate our Scope 3, business 
flight travel data. At Elsevier, new titles included Fuel Cells for 
Transportation: Fundamental Principles and Applications, and 
in the year, we held the 2023 Renewable Transformation 
Challenge along with the International Solar Energy Society 
(ISES). Legal’s Professional Practical Guidance Journal 
featured a dedicated climate change edition and RX held 
World Future Energy Summit 2023, with over 200 hours of 
expert content. 

We are committed to transparency. You can find more 
information and data in the Corporate Responsibility section  
on pages 38-90, including our Taskforce on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosure (TCFD) on page 82. We are preparing for 
disclosures related to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive for release in next year’s Annual Report.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Financial review

Principal and emerging risks

Risk Identification, evaluation, and 
management

RELX has established a well-embedded risk management 
framework based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework 
(2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the 
Treadway Commission (COSO). Through this framework risks 
are identified, assessed, mitigated, and monitored in an effective 
and consistent way across the businesses. 

RELX uses the 3 Lines of Defence model and aligns its systems of 
risk management and internal control with the COSO framework. 
Business Areas are required to maintain systems of risk 
management and internal control which are appropriate to the 
nature and scale of their activities and address all significant 
strategic, operational, financial, legal and regulatory compliance 
and reputational risks that they face. The RELX PLC Board 
monitors the system of internal control and risk management 
and performs an annual assessment of its effectiveness. 

Consideration of current and emerging risks

Our risk management process considers the likelihood and 
impact of risks, the timeline over which a risk could arise, the 
direction in which risks are trending and the effectiveness of our 
mitigation efforts. In addition to consideration of current risks, 
we also identify emerging risks which could impact our business 
in the next 3-5 years. One example of an emerging risk is the 
emerging regulatory environment with respect to Artificial 
Intelligence. We mitigate this risk by maintaining a dialogue with 
the regulatory authorities, following our Responsible AI Principles 
and ensuring that we maintain a robust data privacy and 
governance structure. Another emerging risk related more 
specifically to generative artificial intelligence is the potential for 
invented content, or hallucinations. We mitigate this risk by 
ensuring subject matter experts are involved in every step of the 
development process, employing a robust testing process and 
providing links to our trusted content through hallucination-free 
citations in our AI generated output. Another set of emerging 
risks are climate related risks which are further described on 
pages 38 to 90 in the Corporate Responsibility section of the 2023 
Annual Report. 

RISK

External Risks

MITIGATION

Data Privacy 
In the course of our business, we process personal data from 
customers, end users, employees and other sources. Certain 
business areas rely extensively upon content that includes 
personal data from public records, governmental authorities, 
publicly available information and media, and other information 
companies, including competitors. Changes in data privacy 
legislation, regulation, and/or enforcement could impact our 
ability to collect and use personal data, potentially affecting the 
availability and effectiveness of our products. Failure or perceived 
failure to comply with requirements for proper collection, use, 
storage, transfer and other processing of personal data may 
damage our reputation, divert time and effort of management and 
other resources, increase cost of operations, and expose us to risk 
of loss, fines and penalties, litigation, and increased regulation.

Intellectual property rights
Our products and services include and utilise intellectual 
property. We rely on trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret 
and other intellectual property laws to establish and protect our 
proprietary rights in this intellectual property. There is a risk that 
our proprietary rights could be challenged, limited, invalidated, 
infringed, or circumvented, including by AI technologies, which 
may impact demand for and pricing of our products and services. 
Copyright laws are subject to national legislative initiatives, 
as well as cross-border initiatives such as those from the 
European Commission and increased judicial scrutiny in several 
jurisdictions in which we operate. This creates additional 
challenges for us in protecting our proprietary rights in content 
delivered through the internet and electronic platforms.

We are guided by the RELX Privacy Principles and have 
implemented governance structures, contractual restrictions, 
technical measures, and other controls to protect personal data 
and meet data privacy requirements across all jurisdictions 
where we operate. We have assurance programmes to monitor 
compliance and conduct training and awareness programmes 
for our employees. 

Our commitment to fair, explainable, and accountable AI 
practices as set out in our Responsible Artificial Intelligence 
Principles helps to ensure that our AI uses of personal data are 
subject to robust privacy governance.

We actively engage in developing and promoting the legal 
protection of intellectual property rights. Our subscription 
contracts with customers contain provisions regarding the 
use of proprietary content including use by large language 
models. We are vigilant as to the use of our intellectual property 
and, as appropriate, take action to challenge illegal content 
distribution sources.

Consideration of current and emerging risks

RISK

MITIGATION

Geopolitical, economic and market conditions
Demand for our products and services, and our ability to operate 
internationally, may be adversely impacted by geopolitical, 
economic and market conditions beyond our control. These 
include acts of war and civil unrest; political conflicts and 
tensions; international sanctions; the impact of the effect of 
changes in inflation and interest rates in major economies; trading 
relations between the United States, Europe, China and other 
major economies; as well as levels of government and private 
funding for our markets.

Payment model evolution
Our Scientific, Technical & Medical (STM) primary research 
content publishing business operates under two payment models: 
‘pay-to-read’, where readers or their institutions, as users of the 
content pay, and authors publish for free, or ‘pay-to-publish’, 
where authors or their institutions or funding bodies prefer 
to pay to publish their research, so it is freely available to read. 
The latter model is commonly referred to as Open Access and 
now represents a significant portion of the volume of primary 
research that we publish. There is continued debate in 
government, academic and library communities, regarding the 
payment models and the extent to which research content should 
be freely available to read, either immediately on publication or in 
some form after a period following publication. Rapid changes in 
customer choice or regulation in this area could impact the mix 
and overall level of revenue generated by our primary research 
publishing business.

Our businesses are focused on professional markets which have 
generally been more resilient in periods of economic downturn. 
We deliver information solutions, many on a subscription and 
recurring revenue basis, which are important to our customers’ 
effectiveness and efficiency. We operate diversified businesses in 
terms of sectors, markets, customers, geographies and products 
and services. We have multi-year contracts in place for much of 
the revenue base, and underlying demand drivers in many areas 
are not directly exposed to economic growth (e.g., scientific 
research, healthcare, fraud risk, financial crime compliance). 
Since the last major global recession after the 2008 financial 
crisis, RELX is significantly less dependent on revenue streams 
that were impacted in that period (e.g., advertising, employment 
screening).We have extended our position in long-term global 
growth markets through organic new launches supported by the 
selective acquisitions. We continuously monitor economic and 
political developments to assess their impact on our strategy 
which is designed to mitigate these risks. In response to specific 
uncertainties, our businesses engage in scenario planning and 
develop contingency plans where relevant and consider exiting 
businesses and markets that no longer fit our strategy. 

We engage extensively with stakeholders in the STM community 
to better understand their needs and deliver value to them. 
We provide both pay-to-read and pay-to-publish models for 
our services as well as combinations of the two to support our 
customers diverse needs and preferences. Both payment models 
are available on a subscription or transactional basis. We focus 
on the integrity and quality of research through the editorial and 
peer review process; we invest in efficient editorial and 
distribution platforms and in innovation in platforms and tools to 
make content and data more accessible and actionable; and we 
develop our research systems to provide capabilities to manage 
different payment models. We ensure vigilance on plagiarism 
and the long-term preservation of research findings. To meet 
changing customer needs, we continue to launch dedicated 
pay-to-publish journals across a range of scientific disciplines.

RISK

Strategic Execution Risks

MITIGATION

Customer acceptance of our products
Our businesses are dependent on the continued demand by our 
customers for our products and services and the value placed  
on them. We operate in highly competitive and dynamic markets, 
and the means of delivery, customer demand for, and the products 
and services themselves, continue to change in response to 
technological innovations, such as the use of artificial intelligence, 
legislative and regulatory changes, the entrance of new 
competitors, and other factors. Failure to anticipate and quickly 
adapt to these changes, or to deliver enhanced value to our 
customers, could impact demand for our products and services 
and consequently adversely affect our revenue or the long-term 
returns from our investment in higher value add information-
based analytics and decision tools. 

Acquisitions
We supplement our organic development with selected 
acquisitions. If we are unable to generate the anticipated 
benefits such as revenue growth and/or cost savings associated 
with these acquisitions, it could adversely affect return on 
invested capital and financial condition or lead to an impairment 
of goodwill or intangibles.

Operational Risks

Cyber security
Our businesses maintain and use online databases and platforms 
delivering our products and services, which we rely on, and 
provide data to third parties, including customers and service 
providers. These databases and information are a target for 
compromise and face a risk of unauthorised access and use by 
unauthorised parties including through cyber, ransomware and 
phishing attacks on us or our third-party service providers.

Our cyber security measures, and the measures used by our 
third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all 
attempts to compromise our systems, which may jeopardise the 
security of the data we maintain or may disrupt our systems. 
Failures of our cyber security measures could result in 
unauthorised access to our systems, misappropriation of our or 
our users’ data, deletion or modification of stored information or 
other interruption to our business operations. As techniques used 
to obtain unauthorised access to or to sabotage systems change 
frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our 
third-party service providers we may be unable to anticipate or 
implement adequate measures to protect against these attacks 
and our service providers and customers may likewise be unable 
to do so. 

Compromises of our or our third-party service providers’ systems 
could adversely affect our financial performance, damage our 
reputation and expose us to risk of loss, fines and penalties, 
litigation and increased regulation.

We are focused on the needs and economics of our customers. 
We gain insights into the markets that we serve, evolving 
customers’ needs, the potential application of new technologies 
and business models, and the actions of competitors and 
disrupters. These insights inform our strategic and operational 
priorities. We continuously invest significant resources in 
our products and services, and the infrastructure to support 
them, and we have a long track record of using artificial 
intelligence. We leverage user centered design and development 
methods and customer analytics and invest in new and enhanced 
technologies to provide content and innovative solutions that help 
them achieve better outcomes and enhance productivity.

Acquisitions are made within the framework of our overall 
strategy, which emphasises organic development. We have 
a well formulated process for reviewing and executing 
acquisitions and for managing the post-acquisition integration. 
This process is underpinned with clear strategic, financial 
and ethical criteria. We closely monitor the integration 
and performance of acquisitions.

We have established security programmes which are constantly 
reviewed and updated to address developments in the threat 
landscape with the aim of ensuring our ability to prevent, respond 
to and recover from a cyber-attack or ransomware attack, that 
data is protected, and our business infrastructures and those of 
our third-party service providers continue to operate. 

We have governance mechanisms in place to design and monitor 
common policies and standards across our businesses. 

We invest in appropriate technological and physical controls 
which are applied across the enterprise in a risk-based security 
programme which operates at the infrastructure, application  
and user levels. These controls include, but are not limited to, 
infrastructure vulnerability management, application scanning 
and penetration testing, network segmentation, encryption and 
logging and monitoring. We provide regular training and 
communication initiatives to establish and maintain awareness of 
risks at all levels of our businesses. We have appropriate incident 
response plans to respond to threats and attacks which include 
procedures to recover and restore data and applications in the 
event of an attack. We maintain appropriate information security 
policies and contractual requirements for our businesses and 
run programmes monitoring the application of our data security 
and resilience policies by third party service providers. We use 
independent internal and third-party auditors to test, evaluate, 
and help enhance our procedures and controls. 

We continuously monitor the global regulatory landscape to 
identify emerging cybersecurity, data protection and privacy 
laws, and, as needed, implement plans to comply with them. 
We procure appropriate cybersecurity insurance to mitigate 
potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident.

Face-to-face events
Face-to-face events are susceptible to economic cycles, 
communicable diseases, severe weather events and other natural 
disasters, terrorism and availability of venues. Each or any of 
these may impact our ability to hold face-to-face events, and 
exhibitors’ and visitors’ desire and ability to travel in person to 
events. These factors each have the potential to reduce revenues, 
increase the costs of organising events and adversely affect cash 
flows and reputation.

Supply chain dependencies
Our organisational and operational structures depend on 
suppliers including outsourced and offshored functions, as well 
as cloud service, software, and large language model providers. 
Poor performance, failure or breach of third parties to whom we 
have contracted could adversely affect our business performance, 
reputation and financial condition.

We source content to enable information solutions for our 
professional customers. The disruption or loss of data sources, 
either because of regulations, or because data suppliers decide 
not to supply them, may impose limits on our collection and use of 
certain kinds of information and our ability to communicate, offer 
or make such information available or useful to our customers.

Technology and business resilience
Our businesses are dependent on electronic platforms and 
networks, primarily the internet, for delivery of our products and 
services. These could be adversely affected if our electronic 
delivery platforms, networks or supporting infrastructure 
experience a significant failure or interruption. Climate change 
may increase the intensity and frequency of severe weather events 
which increases the risk of significant failure.

Talent
The implementation and execution of our strategies and business 
plans depend on our ability to recruit, motivate, develop and retain 
a diverse population of skilled employees and management. We 
compete globally and across business sectors for diverse, 
talented management and skilled individuals, particularly those 
with technology and data analytics capabilities. An inability to 
recruit, motivate or retain such people could adversely affect our 
business performance. 

We operate a large number of events across a wide variety  
of venues in many countries, serving both domestic and 
international exhibitors and attendees. We actively review our 
ability to host events considering the availability of venues and 
national and local regulations including those related to health, 
travel, and security. We operate flexibly, rescheduling or 
re-locating events when necessary. We take appropriate 
measures at our events to ensure the well-being and safety of 
exhibitors, visitors and employees. Our face-to-face events are 
supported by enhanced digital services.

We select our suppliers with care and establish contractual 
service levels that we closely monitor, including through 
key performance indicators and targeted supplier audits. 
We have developed business continuity plans to reduce disruption 
in the event of a major failure by a supplier. We have a formal 
supplier resilience program to identify and manage critical 
suppliers across the business. A risk register is used to document 
any unique supplier risks and associated mitigation plans, due 
diligence is performed annually, regular resilience discussions 
are held, and our contractual terms enable us to audit supplier 
resilience plans/procedures.

We have a multitude of data sources that we use to develop 
solutions for our customers and regularly monitor the market for 
new data sources in order to minimize dependence on any single 
provider. Where content is supplied to us by third parties, we aim 
to have contracts which provide mutual commercial benefit.

We have established procedures for the protection of 
our businesses and technology assets. These include 
the development and testing of business continuity plans, 
including technical resilience plans and back-up delivery 
systems, to reduce business disruption in the event of major 
technology or infrastructure failure, terrorism, or adverse 
weather incidents.

We monitor capability needs and remuneration schemes are 
tailored to attract and motivate the best talent available at an 
appropriate level of cost. We actively seek feedback from 
employees, which feeds into plans to enhance employee 
engagement, motivation, and development. Our focus on an 
inclusive culture results in a diverse workforce and environment 
that respects individuals and their contributions.

We maintain an open dialogue with tax authorities and are vigilant 
in ensuring that we comply with current tax legislation. We have 
clear and consistent tax policies and tax matters are dealt with by 
a professional tax function, supported by external advisers. As 
outlined in the Chief Financial Officer’s report on pages 92 to 97 we 
engage with tax authorities and international organisations. We 
continue to monitor legislative developments in the jurisdictions in 
which we operate and consider the potential impacts of proposed 
regulation changes under various scenarios. The principles we 
adopt in our approach to tax matters can be found on our website 
at

Our approach to capital structure and funding is described in the 
Chief Financial Officer’s report on pages 92 to 97. The approach to 
the management of treasury risks is described in note 17 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

Tax
Our businesses operate globally, and our profits are subject 
to taxation in many different jurisdictions and at differing tax rates. 
Tax laws that currently apply to our businesses may be amended 
by the relevant authorities or interpreted differently by them,  
and these changes could adversely affect our reported results.

Treasury
The RELX PLC consolidated financial statements are expressed in 
pounds sterling and are subject to movements in exchange rates 
on the translation of the financial information of businesses whose 
operational currencies are other than sterling. The United States 
is our most important market and, accordingly, significant 
fluctuations in the US dollar exchange rate could significantly 
affect our reported results. We also earn revenues and incur costs 
in a range of other currencies, including the euro and the yen,  
and significant fluctuations in these exchange rates could also 
significantly impact our reported results. 

Macroeconomic, political and market conditions may adversely 
affect the availability and terms of short and long-term funding, 
volatility of interest rates, the credit quality of our counterparties, 
currency exchange rates and inflation. The majority of our 
outstanding debt instruments are, and any of our future debt 
instruments may be, publicly rated by independent rating 
agencies. Our borrowing costs and access to capital may be 
adversely affected if the credit ratings assigned to our debt 
are downgraded.

Pensions
We operate a number of pension schemes around the world, 
including local versions of the defined benefit type in the United 
Kingdom and the United States. The US scheme is closed to future 
accruals. The UK scheme has been closed to new hires since 2010. 
The members who continue to accrue benefits now represent a 
small and reducing portion of the overall UK based workforce. The 
assets and obligations associated with these pension schemes 
are sensitive to changes in the market values of the scheme’s 
investments and the market-related assumptions used to value 
scheme liabilities. Adverse changes to asset values, discount 
rates, longevity assumptions or inflation could increase 
funding requirements.

Reputational Risks 

Ethics
As a global provider of professional information solutions we, 
our employees and major suppliers are expected to adhere to 
high standards of integrity and ethical conduct, including those 
related to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, fraud, sanctions, 
competition and principled business conduct. A breach of 
generally accepted ethical business standards or applicable 
laws could adversely affect our business performance, 
reputation and financial condition.

We have professional management of our pension schemes and 
we focus on maintaining appropriate asset allocation and plan 
designs. We review our funding requirements on a regular basis 
with the assistance of independent actuaries and ensure that the 
funding plans are appropriate. We seek to manage pension 
liabilities by reviewing pension benefits provided to staff 
as well as the structure of scheme arrangements.

Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is provided to every 
employee and is supported by training and communication. 
It encompasses such topics as competing fairly, prohibiting 
corrupt business practice and fair employment practices 
and encouraging open and principled behaviour. We have 
well-established processes for monitoring, reporting and 
investigating instances of unethical conduct. Our major suppliers 
are required to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Financial review

Viability statement
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires Directors to 
assess the viability of the Group over an appropriate period  
of time. The Directors have made the assessment that given  
the nature of the Group’s business with a high proportion of 
recurring revenue, a typical contract length of three years in 
many of its subscription agreements and a balanced debt 
maturity profile, a viability period of three years, aligned with  
the Group’s annual strategy plan, is suitable to assess the risks 
outlined on pages 98 to 103. 

Assessing the Group’s Prospects
The Group develops information-based analytics and decision 
tools for professional and business customers in the Risk, 
Scientific, Technical & Medical (STM), Legal and Exhibitions 
sectors. The Market Segments section describes each area’s 
business model, strategic priorities, market opportunities and 
competition, showing how the Group is positioned to create 
value for shareholders over the longer term.

The Group’s prospects are assessed annually through the 
strategic planning process which includes a review of 
assumptions made and an assessment of each business area’s 
longer-term plan. The resulting three-year strategy plan forms 
the basis for Group and divisional targets and in-year budgets. 
Objectives are set with consideration given to the economic  
and regulatory environment, and to customer trends, as well  
as incorporating risks and opportunities. The most recent 
three-year strategy business plan was agreed by the Directors 
in September 2023 and updated in February 2024. Separate 
from the annual strategy plan, the Directors periodically receive 
updates from business area management on their operations, 
prospects and risks. Whilst these reviews and discussions 
naturally focus more closely on the more immediate risks facing 
the business within the three-year strategy planning period, 
they also cover the risks described in the principal risks section 
on pages 98 to 103.

Assessing the Group’s Viability 
The three-year strategy plan for our business areas includes 
management’s assessment of the anticipated operational risks 
affecting the business. Management then considered the 
viability of the business in various downside scenarios, the most 
severe of which assumes the simultaneous occurrence of Cyber 
security, Intellectual property rights and Face-to-face events 
risks resulting in a decline of around 30% in adjusted operating 
profit in each of 2024 to 2026, and the closure of the debt capital 
markets preventing the refinancing of scheduled liabilities.  
It is assumed that the second extension option on the Group’s 
undrawn $3bn revolving credit facility will be exercised in April 
2024, taking the maturity to April 2027. The resulting analysis, 
which assumed no share buybacks, modest acquisition activity 
and a growing dividend, determined that the Group would have 
sufficient liquidity to refinance all maturing term debt.

We remain focused on successfully pursuing our strategic 
priority of organically developing increasingly sophisticated 
information-based analytics and decision tools that deliver 
enhanced value to our customers, supplemented by selective 
acquisitions that support our organic growth. We believe the 
combination of compelling structural opportunities combined 
with an appropriate capital structure will continue to drive 
long-term value.

Based on this assessment and the scenario modelling that 
shows sufficient liquidity even with the simultaneous 
occurrence of principal risks and the closure of the debt capital 
markets, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue its operations 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years 
and are not aware of any longer-term operational or strategic 
risks that would result in a different outcome from the 
three-year review.

on pages 98 to 103.

Going concern 
The Directors have adopted the going concern basis in  
preparing these accounts after assessing the potential impact 
on the business of the principal risks over the 18 months to  
30 June 2025 and during the longer period over which the 
Group’s viability has been assessed, as described on page 
104. Management forecasts reflect a downside scenario 
which includes the simultaneous occurrence of principal risks, 
which combined would reduce adjusted operating profit by 
around 30%. We have also assumed an inability to access the 
debt capital markets. Under this scenario, the Group will still 
have substantial liquidity headroom on its undrawn $3bn 
revolving credit facility (which does not contain a financial 
covenant). Having considered this downside scenario, the 
Directors believe that the Group is well-positioned to manage its 
business risks and that adequate resources exist for the Group 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
They therefore consider it is appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the 2023 financial statements.

A commentary on the Group’s cash flows, financial position and 
liquidity for the year ended 31 December 2023 is set out in the 
Chief Financial Officer’s report on pages 92 to 97. This shows that 
after taking account of available cash resources and committed 
bank facilities that back up short-term borrowings, all of the 
Group’s borrowings that mature in the period to 30 June 2025 
can be repaid in full. The Group’s policies on liquidity, capital 
management and management of risks relating to interest 
rate, foreign exchange and credit exposures are set out on 
pages 194 to 200. The principal risks facing the Group are set 
out on pages 98 to 103.

The Strategic Report, as set out on pages 2 to 105 has been approved by the Board of RELX PLC.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Chair’s introduction to corporate governance

Stakeholder engagement and Board decision-making
The views and interests of RELX’s stakeholders are a key element 
of the Board’s decision-making process. We are focussed on 
ensuring that the interests of our stakeholders are duly taken into 
account during Board discussions. Across RELX we engage with 
our stakeholders throughout the year and we rely on this 
engagement to ensure we continue to provide solutions and 
services that meet the evolving needs of our customers and 
continue to effectively support our workforce. 

This is why we actively listen to our investors, employees, 
customers, suppliers and the communities that we serve and in 
which we operate, and we have appropriate mechanisms in place 
to ensure that the outcomes of such engagement are available to 
the Board. Information about our approach to stakeholder 
engagement is on pages 119 to 122.

Regulatory developments
During 2023, the UK Government and other regulatory bodies 
have considered several potential governance reforms. These 
proposals have evolved over the course of the year and we still 
await their finalisation. To ensure the Board is kept apprised of 
developments in this regard, we established a management 
steering committee, reporting to the Audit Committee, tasked 
with assessing the Company’s preparedness to respond to and 
implement any UK regulatory changes should they be adopted. 
The Audit Committee has also attended technical briefings with 
our external advisers on the scope and likely impact of the 
proposed reforms on RELX.

The Board has engaged with management in respect of further 
regulatory changes in the areas of sustainability and ESG 
reporting, which will impact RELX over the coming years. We have 
robust governance processes in place in respect of ESG matters 
and continue to monitor developments in this area, including in 
relation to the European Union Sustainability Reporting 
Standards and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.

Board effectiveness
As Chair, I am responsible for ensuring that the Board operates 
effectively, and that the Board, its Committees and each individual 
Director is evaluated on an annual basis. In 2023, we engaged 
Manchester Square Partners to conduct an externally facilitated 
evaluation.

The outcome of the evaluation confirmed that all of our Directors 
contribute effectively and continue to demonstrate commitment 
to their roles, and that the Board and its Committees continue to 
operate effectively. The evaluation process and its outcomes are 
explained on page 123.

Paul Walker
Chair

14 February 2024

Effective governance policies and 
practices are fundamental to 
RELX’s culture of acting with integrity 
in all that we do.

Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to introduce our Corporate 
Governance Review for the year ended 31 December 2023. The 
following pages provide an overview of our corporate governance 
framework and of the work undertaken by the Board and its 
Committees during the year. 

Together with the reports of the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees, our corporate governance review 
sets out our approach to effective governance and demonstrates 
how we have complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Corporate governance
The Board takes seriously its responsibility for overseeing the 
governance of RELX. We believe that effective governance policies 
and practices are fundamental to RELX’s culture of acting with 
integrity in all that we do and support the Company’s purpose to 
benefit society through its unique contributions (as set out on  
page 45 to 49). 

The Board believes pursuing the highest levels of corporate 
responsibility and delivering excellent financial performance 
should be pursued in tandem, and that doing so will result in 
long-term sustainable shareholder value creation. It also 
provides confidence to our stakeholders that the governance of 
RELX is appropriate for its size and profile as a listed company, 
helps to manage our risks and opportunities, ensures that our key 
stakeholders are appropriately considered in the decisions that 
we make, and maintains our corporate reputation.

Board changes and succession planning
There have been a number of changes to the composition of our 
Board and Committees during the year. Dr Wolfhart Hauser 
retired following the conclusion of our annual general meeting in 
April after serving as a Director since 2013. We thank Dr Hauser 
for his valued contributions to the Board and to the various 
Committees on which he served over the years. Suzanne Wood 
succeeded Dr Hauser as our Senior Independent Director,  
and Robert MacLeod has taken on the role of Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee.

We are pleased to have welcomed Alistair Cox to the Board this 
year. Following his appointment as a Non-Executive Director  
in April, Mr Cox has also joined our Audit, Remuneration and 
Corporate Governance Committees. In December 2023 the 
Company announced that Bianca Tetteroo will be joining the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director, with effect from 1 July 2024, 
subject to her election by shareholders at our AGM in April 2024. 
We look forward to welcoming her to the Board. Further 
information about our Board appointment process is available  
in our Nominations Committee Report on page 127.

The 2024 AGM will mark the retirement of Marike van Lier Lels 
from the Board. Marike joined the RELX PLC Board in 2015.  
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Ms van Lier Lels for  
her valued contributions to RELX.

Chair’s introduction to corporate governance

Corporate governance review

Our governance framework

Board leadership
The Board is responsible for promoting the long-term sustainable success of the Company. To ensure the Board operates 
effectively and efficiently it has established four principal Committees to provide focused oversight, each with delegated authority 
to oversee and report to the Board on material and relevant matters, as appropriate.

The roles and responsibilities of each Committee are set out in their individual terms of reference which are available on the 
Company’s website 

 www.relx.com. A summary of the Committees’ key responsibilities is set out below.

The Board
The Board determines RELX’s purpose and values and sets and oversees delivery of its strategic aims  
and objectives for long-term, sustainable success. The Board monitors and oversees RELX’s governance, risk management  
and internal controls processes and culture.

Audit Committee
Reviews and monitors the 
integrity of financial reporting, 
internal control and risk 
management systems, the 
effectiveness of the internal 
audit process and the 
performance, independence 
and effectiveness of the 
external auditor. 

The Committee comprises only 
independent Non-Executive 
Directors.

Remuneration Committee
Determines, monitors and 
oversees the implementation of 
RELX’s remuneration policy for 
the CEO, CFO, the Chair, and 
Senior Executives below Board 
level. The Committee reviews 
the ongoing appropriateness of 
the remuneration policy. 

The Committee comprises only 
the Chair and Non-Executive 
Directors.

   Further information about 
the work of the Audit 
Committee is in its report 
on pages 149 to 152

   The Directors’

Keeps under review the 
composition of the Board and its 
Committees; ensures orderly 
succession plans are in place for 
the Board and senior 
management and ensures a 
diverse pipeline for such 
succession and procures the 
recruitment of new Directors. 

The Committee comprises only 
the Chair and Non-Executive 
Directors.  

   Further information  
about the work of the 
Nominations Committee 
is in its report on pages 125 
to 127

Corporate Governance 
Committee
Responsible for developing and 
recommending corporate 
governance principles to the 
Board; reviewing ongoing 
developments and best practice 
in corporate governance,  
and monitoring the structure 
and operation of the Board 
Committees. 

The Committee comprises only 
the Chair and Non-Executive 
Directors. 

RELX Senior Executives
To enable efficient day-to-day management of RELX’s business areas, there is a structure of delegated authorities in place from 
the Board to the Chief Executive Officer and a team of Senior Executives (shown on pages 110 to 111). This delegated authority 
framework, which is reviewed and approved by the Board each year, allows the necessary operational and management decisions 
to be taken by the right people, at the appropriate time to execute the company’s strategy. There are appropriate controls in place to 
ensure such decisions remain consistent with the risk appetite, policies and objectives established by the Board.

RELX’s culture of acting with integrity

Introduction

Stakeholder engagement and Board decision-making

The views and interests of RELX’s stakeholders are a key element 

of the Board’s decision-making process. We are focussed on 

ensuring that the interests of our stakeholders are duly taken into 

account during Board discussions. Across RELX we engage with 

our stakeholders throughout the year and we rely on this 

engagement to ensure we continue to provide solutions and 

services that meet the evolving needs of our customers and

Governance structure
RELX’s corporate governance framework consists of leadership 
bodies, processes and supporting documentation to ensure that 
RELX is appropriately directed, led and controlled at all levels, 
with appropriate oversight and involvement by the Board and 
senior management. It is designed to safeguard and enhance the 
creation of long-term, sustainable shareholder value and to 
enable our business areas to operate with the required agility and 
flexibility to address effectively the needs of our customers, while 
taking into account all applicable statutory and regulatory 
requirements. The rights, responsibilities and accountabilities of 
those who work for and on behalf of RELX are clearly established 
through delegated authorities, corporate policies and codes of 
ethics and conduct, which promote the protection of RELX’s 
reputation and our commitment to acting with integrity in all that 
we do. The RELX Operating and Governance Principles set out the 
processes, policies, controls and related assurance activities that 
have been put in place to mitigate risk and serve as a first point of 
reference for management. They also provide our workforce with 
the corporate policies and practices with which they must comply. 

The Principles are regularly reviewed by the Board and are 
updated as required. RELX’s Ethics Code sets out the core 
principles and standards of professional conduct by which RELX 
operates and provides a framework for building and maintaining 
the desired culture of RELX. The Ethics Code provides all those 
who work for RELX with clear guidelines for how to conduct 
themselves in the workplace and across our broader operating 
environments, to inspire trust among all our stakeholders and to 
demonstrate commitment to our core value of ‘Do the Right 
Thing’. There are mechanisms in place to help our workforce 
to understand and comply with their obligations under the 
Ethics Code, which include ongoing training and established 
communication channels to ask questions and report concerns. 
We endeavour to ensure that our workplace policies are 
user-friendly, clear and accessible. The Ethics Code is 
regularly reviewed and approved by the Board and is available  
at, 
 www.relx.com. Internal control and risk management 
arrangements are a central part of our governance framework. 
These are monitored by the Audit Committee and overseen by 
the Board (further information is on pages 124 and 149 to 152).

the Board (further information is on pages 124 and 149 to 152).

Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code

RELX PLC applies the principles and provisions of the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code), a copy of which is 
available on the FRC’s website, 

 www.frc.org.uk. 

For the year ended 31 December 2023, the Board considers 
that the company fully complied with the principles and 
provisions of the Code. 

Board programme

The Board met formally seven times during the year. Five 
meetings were held in person, in the UK and in New York. Through 
a structured programme of scheduled meetings, the Board 
oversees RELX’s financial performance and ensures its systems 
of risk management, internal control and corporate governance 
are fit for purpose and effectively underpin the delivery of its 
strategy. There are processes in place to manage the Board’s 
annual agenda, to ensure that all necessary items are submitted 
for its consideration at the appropriate time with sufficient 
supporting information, and to allow the Board adequate time 
to discuss and challenge strategic proposals. The Board’s annual 
programme and the agendas for the Committees are prepared 
by their respective Chairs with support from the Company 
Secretary. Board Committees are principally supported by 
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal 
Officer and Company Secretary, and the Chief Human Resources 
Officer, and other senior managers are invited to attend meetings 
where appropriate. 

Board discussions are informed through regular reports and 
presentations from senior management at Board and Committee 
meetings, and through deep-dive sessions into individual 
business areas, topics of strategic relevance and future 
developments that may impact RELX. Regular reports are 
provided, covering business area and overall strategies and 
financials, along with relevant regulatory, legislative and 
governance updates. RELX’s annual strategy review process 
comprehensively assesses its strategic position and key strategic 
options, considering opportunities and risks to its future success 
and the long-term sustainability and viability of its business 
model. The Board engaged in a two-day, in-depth strategy session 
in September.

Information and support
There are processes in place to ensure that the Board and its 
Committees receive relevant information at the right time and 
with the appropriate level of detail to inform decision-making and 
enable effective monitoring of management’s progress in 
accordance with agreed strategy. The Directors are provided with 
papers ahead of all scheduled Board and Committee meetings, 
containing management updates, relevant context and market 
information, and other supporting information and reports, 
as appropriate. 

All the Directors have access to the advice of the Company 
Secretary and may also take independent professional advice at 
the company’s expense where they deem this to be necessary 
for the furtherance of their duties to the company. The Company 
Secretary advises the Board on all corporate governance matters 
and ensures that all Board procedures are followed correctly. 
The Directors also have access to other members of RELX’s 
management, staff and external advisers.

Each of the Directors is expected to attend all meetings of the 
Board and of the Committees of which they are a member. 
However, in circumstances where a Director is unable to attend 
a meeting, they are provided with the relevant papers and have 
the opportunity to discuss any matters arising with the respective 
Chair and with their fellow Board and Committee members. 
All Directors are provided with a copy of the minutes of 
each meeting.

Director induction
Following appointment, and as required, all Directors 
receive a full, formal induction, that is tailored to their 
individual requirements, based on existing knowledge and 
experience. The Chair and Company Secretary are responsible 
for ensuring that an effective induction programme takes place 
for all new Directors.

During the year, Alistair Cox (appointed in April 2023) was provided 
with a comprehensive briefing pack including detailed information 
about each of RELX’s business areas, governance and internal 
controls, and recent reporting and investor materials, together 
with access to historical Board papers and minutes. To provide a 
sufficiently in-depth and current understanding of our operations, 
a number of meetings were organised with senior management 
from RELX’s business areas and corporate functions, as well as 
with the external auditor.

Ongoing development
For Directors to effectively discharge their responsibilities, it is 
important that they regularly refresh and update their skills and 
knowledge. The Board’s annual programme is designed with this 
in mind and ensures that the Directors have sufficiently in-depth 
knowledge of RELX’s business areas and operations and are kept 
apprised of relevant events and changes in RELX’s operating 
environment and markets. In 2023, the Directors took part in a 
deep-dive into the Legal and Exhibitions business areas, covering 
financial and operational performance by segment, product 
development and strategic plans. The Audit Committee also 
attended a series of technical deep-dive briefing sessions. 
Further information about the work and activities of the Audit 
Committee is available in the Audit Committee Report 149 to 152.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Purpose, strategy, values and culture

RELX places significant emphasis and importance on the way we do business. We are clear and unequivocal about our commitment to 
do so with integrity and in accordance with the highest ethical standards. 

Purpose
RELX is a provider of information-based analytics and decision 
tools for professional and business customers, enabling 
them to make better decisions, get better results and be 
more productive.

Our purpose is to benefit society by developing products that 
help researchers advance scientific knowledge; doctors and 
nurses improve the lives of patients; lawyers promote the rule 
of law and achieve justice and fair results for their clients; 
businesses and governments prevent fraud; consumers 
access financial services and get fair prices on insurance, and 
customers learn about markets and complete transactions.

data sets and analytics, and assets in high-growth markets that 
support our organic growth strategies and are natural additions 
to our existing business.

By focusing on evolving the fundamentals of our business we 
believe that, over time, we are improving our business profile 
and the quality of our earnings. This strategy has led to more 
predictable revenues through a better asset mix and 
geographic balance; improved returns by focusing on organic 
development with strong cash generation; and a higher growth 
profile as we expand in higher growth segments, exit from 
structurally challenged businesses, and gradually reduce the 
drag from print format declines.

Our purpose guides our actions beyond the products that we 
develop. It defines us as a company. Every day across RELX 
our employees are inspired to undertake initiatives that 
make unique contributions to society and the communities 
in which we operate.

Strategy
Our number one strategic priority is the organic development 
of increasingly sophisticated information-based analytics and 
decision tools that deliver enhanced value to professional and 
business customers. We aim to achieve leading positions in 
long-term global growth markets and leverage our skills, 
assets and resources across RELX, both to build solutions 
for our customers and to pursue cost efficiencies. We are 
systematically migrating all of our information solutions across 
RELX towards higher value-add decision tools, adding broader 
data sets, embedding more sophisticated analytics and 
leveraging more powerful technology, primarily through 
organic development. We are transforming our core business, 
building out new products and expanding into higher growth 
adjacencies and geographies. We are supplementing this 
organic development with selective acquisitions of targeted 

Values
We strive to do business with integrity. Our principle ‘Do the 
Right Thing’ embraces behaviours such as being honest in 
dealing with others, respecting each other, and courageously 
speaking out for what is right; thereby guiding our commitment 
to achieve business goals in an open, honest, ethical, and 
principled way. We ask our suppliers to meet the same 
standards, and provide support for them to do so as necessary.

Culture
As an information-based analytics and decision tool provider, 
our corporate culture is fact-based, data-driven and analytical. 
We are transparent and non-political in our decision-making. 
We are passionate about making a positive impact on society 
through our unique contributions as a business and our 
employees feel a strong sense of engagement with the 
business and its purpose. We focus on improving customer 
outcomes while emphasising corporate responsibility and 
acting with integrity and advancing inclusiveness and 
diversity. Our culture encourages community engagement, 
environmental responsibility and the well-being of our people.

How the Board monitors culture
RELX’s standards and values are defined on a group-wide basis, 
however the Board acknowledges that cultural practices and 
preferred ways of working can vary across the geographies of  
our business areas. The Board helps to build the culture of the 
organisation from the top down, by ensuring that it takes decisions 
that are aligned to RELX’s values. The Board regularly reviews 
RELX’s policies and Ethics Code to ensure the right framework 
is in place for RELX to operate with integrity, and that its working 
practices effectively promote a culture of strong engagement 
with our business and purpose, and with the communities that we 
serve and in which we operate. We strive to continually improve 
customer outcomes through a culture that is fact-based, 
data-driven and analytical. 

The Board has appointed a Non-Executive Workforce Engagement 
Director to engage directly with employee representatives from 
across RELX and to report back to the Board (further information 
about this engagement is on page 120). This provides the Board 
with insights into how culture is embedded across RELX’s 

business areas and functions and any issues that need to be 
addressed. The views of employees are also measured through 
annual employee engagement surveys, and a broader triennial 
opinion survey, designed to gauge how employees feel about the 
organisation, how well they understand its direction, and their 
level of satisfaction and engagement with their work. An analysis 
of the results is presented to the Board. The Board also receives 
regular reports and presentations containing culture-related 
employee data and updates on corporate responsibility activities 
from across each of RELX’s business areas. Such reports  
include progress against our people objectives in areas such  
as well-being, pay equity and reducing inequalities through 
inclusion. This contributes to the Board’s assessment of the 
culture at RELX and provides a context against which the Board 
has taken a number of its principal decisions during the year.

Through the activities of the Audit Committee, the Board receives 
updates on alleged and substantiated violations of the Ethics Code 
and significant matters raised through reporting channels, which 
provide insights into governance and compliance behaviours.

our corporate culture is fact-based, data-driven and analytical.

capital expenditure and areas for potential acquisitions across all four business areas, and robust 
operational plans for delivery across RELX’s business areas for implementation by management.

	§ In June and September, the Directors attended presentations led by business area senior

approval at the 2024 AGM.

	§ Having the right people in leadership roles is an important factor in embedding the desired culture for

Stakeholder engagement

During the year, the Board undertook a review of RELX’s key stakeholders and concluded that they remain unchanged from the previous 
year. The Board received a detailed overview of stakeholder engagement channels and activities and confirmed that it has adequate 
visibility of the views of key stakeholders, which are taken into consideration in its decision-making. Further information about the 
nature and outcomes of the RELX’s engagement with its stakeholders are detailed throughout this Annual Report and examples of 
the Board’s engagement with key stakeholders are set out on the following pages.

Investors

Why effective engagement 
is important

Engagement with our 
investors helps them to 
understand our strategy, 
performance and 
governance arrangements, 
and to make informed 
decisions concerning the 
company. It also makes 
clear our prioritisation of 
the long term in our 
decision-making and focus 
on delivery of consistent 
financial performance. 

Our investors provide us 
with input and feedback 
concerning the 
development and 
implementation of our 
strategy, and we consider 
their views when making 
investment decisions.

How we engage, outcomes and impact

Engagement with our investors is undertaken by members of the Board and at a business level by 
senior management and our Investor Relations, Corporate Responsibility and Treasury teams. 
The Board is updated with feedback and commentary received from investors through business 
engagement, investor roadshows and meetings with institutional shareholders in respect of our 
recent and proposed activities.

The Board receives regular reports on the company’s share price and shareholder return 
performance and a review of analyst commentary in response to the company’s market 
announcements and results publications. Executive Directors and senior management gave a 
number of investor and analyst presentations during the year to provide further detail and context 
to our published results and strategy plans.

During the year: 

	§ Our engagement processes confirmed that investors in the main continue to understand and 

support our organic growth strategy. The Board considered this when approving RELX’s three-year 
strategic plan for 2024 to 2026, which leaves our strategic focus, and our priorities for uses of cash 
generated by RELX, broadly unchanged. 

	§ In response to interest from the investment community, RELX presented a demonstration of  
its new Legal AI tool, Lexis+ AI, at an event attended by over 200 investors and analysts. The 
presentation demonstrated the strategic position of our Legal business in the AI space and the 
Board were provided with the feedback from attendees. Further information about Lexis+ AI is on 
page 10.

	§ Senior management led an investor seminar on our Risk business, with a focus on Insurance 

Services. The presentation demonstrated the continued evolution of Risk, covering its markets, 
customers, growth trajectory and technological capabilities, and included an open Q&A session. 
The presentation is available at 
 www.relx.com/investors

	§ The Company’s AGM in 2023 was a valuable opportunity for Directors to interact directly with 
shareholders, to hear their views and answer questions about the business of the meeting.

	§ RELX’s material communications to investors, including trading updates, the Annual Report 

and Notice of AGM were reviewed and approved by the Board prior to release.

	§ In respect of shareholder returns, the Board considered a range of investor and analyst views, 

balancing the impact of returning capital to shareholders with stakeholder interests in other key 
RELX financial metrics, and subsequently approved the quantum of the company’s share buyback 
programme for 2023 and declared and recommended an interim and final dividend payment during 
the year.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Employees

Why effective engagement 
is important

Our people’s well-being and 
their commitment to the work 
they do are essential to our 
future growth and our aim to 
successfully build long-term 
leading positions in global 
growth markets.

We strive to foster an 
environment in which our 
employees feel a strong sense of 
engagement with our business 
and share a passion for making 
a positive impact on society 
through our unique 
contributions. RELX actively 
seeks feedback from employees 
to understand their key 
challenges and concerns and 
where we can work to address 
these. Hearing their views on 
what we do well, and what we 
can do better, is an important 
driver for improvement and 
enables us to take action to 
retain our best talent.

Effective engagement helps to 
mitigate the risk of not being 
able to recruit, motivate and 
retain skilled employees and 
management, which is 
recognised as a principal 
risk (see page 101).

How we engage, outcomes and impact

Employee engagement routinely takes place at business level and matters of concern are cascaded 
up through our management framework. The Board receives regular management reports  
which cover employee engagement, turnover and demographic analysis, updates on workplace 
initiatives, progress towards I&D objectives, and concerns raised through our Ethics Code 
reporting channels. The Board takes time to review employee engagement and workforce data 
and takes this into consideration during wider discussions.

RELX has a dedicated intranet for employees which is kept updated with financial and performance 
information, news of business developments and workforce initiatives and events (including in I&D) 
and other important messages from senior management. 

The Board has appointed Marike van Lier Lels as our Non-Executive Workforce Engagement 
Director to engage directly with employee representatives from across RELX and to report to 
the Board on the progress of RELX’s workforce initiatives, together with the challenges, concerns 
and priorities of employees. This provides the Board with insight into the culture across RELX, 
how our working practices and initiatives have been received and highlights any issues that need 
to be addressed.

During the year: 

	§ Ms van Lier Lels, met with workforce representatives to learn about the experiences of 

employees while working at RELX. Ms van Lier Lels reported to the Board on the matters 
discussed. These included positive feedback about RELX’s mentorship programmes, which are 
monitored by management to track their impact on employee performance, retention and net 
promoter scores. Further matters included the impact of ongoing hybrid working arrangements 
in different business areas, and RELX’s training programmes and opportunities. 

	§ In 2023 we undertook our annual Pulse employee opinion survey. An analysis of the results of 
the survey was presented to the Board in December and confirmed positive trends across all 
business areas in the key metrics of engagement, satisfaction, commitment and employee net 
promoter scores. 

	§ Board reports from the Chief Human Resources Officer highlighted the steps taken to identify, 
support and develop current and future leaders across the business through Organisational 
Talent Review and Management Development Planning processes. This focus has seen 
increased gender diversity across internal succession pipelines, complemented by targeted 
senior level recruitment. 

	§ The Board endorsed the development of a group-wide leadership framework for management 
and executive leaders, to unify and simplify existing frameworks and ensure leaders across our 
business areas continue to develop the skills and behaviours that drive our strategy, role model 
our values and champion our culture.

	§ The Board reviewed the Board and RELX Inclusion and Diversity Policies and determined that 

these continue to be fit for purpose and effective.

	§ The Board received a presentation from the Head of Corporate Communications on focus areas 
for 2023, which included consideration of the most effective methods to deliver key information 
about the business to the wider workforce, and for continuing to develop understanding of our 
purpose, strategy and values. Employee understanding and engagement with our purpose and 
strategy is monitored through our employee opinion survey scores over time.

	§ Employee involvement in the company’s performance is encouraged through RELX’s employee 
share schemes, which were refreshed and put to shareholders for approval at the 2023 AGM. 
The RELX PLC Employee Share Purchase Plan was also introduced in the US to enable a greater 
proportion of RELX employees the opportunity to purchase ADRs at a discounted price.

purpose, strategy and values. Employee understanding and engagement with our purpose and 

strategy is monitored through our employee opinion survey scores over time.

	§ Employee involvement in the company’s performance is encouraged through RELX’s employee 

share schemes, which were refreshed and put to shareholders for approval at the 2023 AGM. 

The RELX PLC Employee Share Purchase Plan was also introduced in the US to enable a greater 

proportion of RELX employees the opportunity to purchase ADRs at a discounted price. 

Customers

Why effective engagement 
is important

Our goal is to help customers 
make better decisions, get better 
results and be more productive. 
We do this by leveraging a deep 
understanding of their needs 
and views to create innovative 
solutions.

Collaborating closely with our 
customers is crucial for us to 
understand where and how we 
can improve the quality of our 
services and products, and 
enables us to make targeted 
investment decisions, such as 
to develop new or emerging 
technologies or complement 
our existing capabilities through 
acquisition activity.

Suppliers

Why effective engagement 
is important

RELX has a diverse supply 
chain with suppliers located 
in over 150 countries across 
multiple categories, which 
RELX categorises as content 
suppliers and non-content 
suppliers.

Collaboration and two-way 
dialogue with our suppliers 
helps ensure that we are able 
to maintain and improve the 
quality of products and services 
we provide to our customers. 
Effective engagement 
underpins our ability to 
maintain an ethical supply 
chain, giving us visibility of our 
suppliers’ commitment to 
good practices.

How we engage, outcomes and impact

Our engagement with customers takes place at an operational level across our business areas, 
through our dedicated sales and operations teams and through customer training and workshops. 
Material customer issues are cascaded up to the appropriate senior management. The Board 
received presentations during the year from customer-facing employees which detailed the nature 
of our customer engagement and the actions taken by the business areas as a result. In 2023, the 
Board received analysis of customers by sector and geography and data concerning the resilience 
of the markets in which we operate. The Board reviewed customer survey data, Net Promoter 
Scores, and customer usage volumes across our business areas.

During the year: 

	§ The Board continued to monitor current and anticipated future customer demand and market 
activity together with customer feedback, to understand how our product offerings address 
customer requirements. This information informed the areas of focus for product development 
and acquisitions and the level of investment required. RELX made several acquisitions during 
the year that complement its existing product range and enhance value for our customers. 
More information about our acquisitions during the year can be found on pages 9, 15, 27 and 32.

	§ Feedback from our customers informed the Board and management’s assessment of the areas 
in which RELX should build out new products and services, the speed at which this should be 
undertaken, and where it should look to expand into higher growth adjacencies and geographies 
over varying time horizons.

How we engage, outcomes and impact

Engagement with our content suppliers, which include the companies we license content or data 
from, as well as authors, editors, content reviewers and product designers, takes place principally 
through ongoing dialogue with the relevant business area to which the content is provided.  
Content supplier feedback is collected through direct relationships and regular business reviews, 
and presented to the Board through updates from our business area leaders.

Our non-content suppliers represent more typical vendor-type relationships, such as IT 
software and cloud service providers, or third parties to whom we have outsourced support 
function activities. Engagement takes place at various levels throughout RELX. Feedback is 
reported to the Board by business area leaders and the Global Head of Purchasing and Property.

During the year: 

	§ Outcomes of ongoing business engagement with our content suppliers, including Net Promoter 
Scores and the outcomes of business reviews, informed the Board’s discussions during its 
consideration of RELX’s three-year strategy plan for 2023 to 2026, and its assessment of 
mitigations in place for our principal risks of customer acceptance of products and supply 
chain dependencies.

	§ Our Supplier Code of Conduct has been translated into 16 languages for use across RELX.  

The Board continues to support our Socially Responsible Supplier (SRS) programme (further 
details are on pages 69 to 72). The Board also reviewed and approved our Modern Slavery Act 
Statement, available from 
 www.relx.com, which sets out the steps taken by the Company 
and its subsidiaries to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its business and 
supply chain.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Community

Why effective engagement 
is important

Our focus on community 
includes those where we, our 
customers and suppliers work 
around the world, as well as 
the communities we serve, 
including in science, academia, 
risk, law and many other fields.

We prioritise positive dialogue 
with our community 
stakeholders as we believe they, 
collectively, provide our ‘licence 
to operate’. Our efforts are 
informed by our commitment 
to the United Nations Global 
Compact and its ten principles, 
focused on human rights, 
labour, the environment and 
anti-corruption – all issues 
with wide societal impact.

How we engage, outcomes and impact

We engage with our community stakeholders through our unique contributions to society, and 
through our comprehensive global community programme, RELX Cares. The RELX Cares 
mission is the education of disadvantaged young people. Further information about our RELX 
Cares projects and its contributions to the communities in which we operate is on pages 65 to 68.

In accordance with the Business for Societal Impact model, we monitor the short- and long-term 
benefits of our community engagement. We survey RELX Cares volunteers to understand the 
impact of the programme on their personal development and how it affects the way they feel 
about working at RELX.

Relevant ESG considerations are incorporated into business review and strategy papers 
reviewed by the Board.

During the year: 

	§ The Board considered RELX’s environmental performance and supported ongoing initiatives 
for minimising our environmental impact, and continued to endorse our commitment to our 
reaching net zero by 2040. More information is in our Corporate Responsibility Report on 
pages 38 to 90.

	§ The Board received comprehensive updates on community engagement during the year, 

including key metrics, objectives and outcomes. Board feedback and support for community 
engagement shapes the direction of our charitable programmes and future plans.

	§ The Board continued to endorse RELX’s volunteering policy through which RELX employees 

receive two days paid leave each year to undertake community volunteering work.

	§ The Board supported the business areas utilising their unique product offerings to support 

causes in their communities. 

External appointments and Non-Executive Director independence
The Board has in place formal procedures to evaluate and review 
the external commitments of Directors, each of whom are 
required to obtain the Board’s approval prior to accepting new 
significant external appointments. During the year, the Board 
reviewed proposed external appointments of Suzanne Wood and 
Robert MacLeod. It was concluded that these appointments would 
not impact either Director’s ability to effectively perform their 
respective roles on the Board of RELX PLC, and accordingly 
the Board gave its approval in each instance. 

When Directors take up new external appointments, any related 
commercial relationships with RELX are reviewed, and any 
potential conflicts of interest are dealt with following formal 
procedures. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, Directors who are not conflicted may authorise, 
as appropriate, situations where a Director has an interest 
that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with those of RELX, 
and may impose conditions on such authorisations. 

Supported by the Nominations Committee, the Board monitors 
the independence of the Non-Executive Directors in line with  
the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
An annual evaluation, led by the Nominations Committee, 
considered whether length of service or any other factor has or 
may impact the ability of any Non-Executive Director to remain 
independent in character and judgement in the furtherance of his 
or her duties to the Company. The Board determined that each of 
the Non-Executive Directors is considered to be independent of 
management and free from any business or other relationship 
which could materially interfere with their ability to exercise 
independent judgement (with the exception of the Chair, whose 
independence was not assessed, but who was deemed to be 
independent upon appointment).

management and free from any business or other relationship 

which could materially interfere with their ability to exercise 

independent judgement (with the exception of the Chair, whose 

independence was not assessed, but who was deemed to be 

independent upon appointment). 

Board evaluation 

The Directors consider the evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees to be an important aspect of corporate governance. 
The Board undertakes an annual evaluation of its own 
effectiveness and performance, and that of its Committees 
and each individual Director.

Actions from the 2022 Board evaluation
In the 2022 Board evaluation, the Board agreed that it should 
continue to focus on the competitor landscape and on the key risks 
facing RELX, including cyber and data security. It was also noted 
that maintaining effective levels of engagement with RELX’s  
key stakeholders and continuing to promote constructive 
relationships between the Non-Executive Directors and 
management should remain priorities for the Board. As part  
of the 2023 evaluation, the Board members confirmed that these 
actions had been appropriately addressed during 2023, through 
regular reporting, presentations and deep dives provided by 
senior management.

2023 Evaluation process
In 2023, the Board evaluation process was externally facilitated 
by an independent consultancy, Manchester Square Partners, 
and was supported by the Company Secretary. Manchester 
Square Partners has no other connections with the Company 
and the consultants were given full access to the Board and 
Committee papers for the relevant period. 

The evaluation consisted of a questionnaire completed by all 
Directors, one-to-one interviews with each member of the Board, 
a presentation of the final report, and facilitation of a discussion 
around key findings and action points to take forward.

The Directors were asked to provide their feedback and 
commentary on the following areas:

	§ Board composition and effectiveness
	§ Quality of information provided by management
	§ Boardroom culture and dynamics
	§ Effectiveness of the Board’s oversight of strategy 

development, setting and monitoring the RELX’s culture and 
values, financial performance, market developments, 
stakeholder relations (including the Board’s understanding 
and visibility of the views of RELX’s stakeholders and how 
these inform its decision-making process), talent and 
succession, inclusion and diversity, risk and governance

	§ The structure, leadership and overall effectiveness of each 

of the Board’s Committees

Chair’s Assessment
The Directors reported that the transition to a new Chair had been 
very smooth and successful and reported highly positive Board 
dynamics under Mr Walker’s leadership. The Directors felt that 
Mr Walker effectively enabled and encouraged challenge and 
contributions from the Non-Executive Directors. His demonstrably 
strong interest in the business areas and the amount of time he 
invested in preparing for meetings of the Board and in building 
relationships with senior management was highly regarded by  
the others on the Board. 

Individual director performance
The evaluation provided opportunity for reflection on personal 
development and individual Director performance. The findings 
of this evaluation highlighted that each Director continues to 
contribute positively and effectively both within and outside  
Board and Committee meetings and constructively challenges 
management on key issues. Through the evaluation process it 
was also confirmed that each Non-Executive Director remains 
independent and has sufficient time to devote to their respective 
roles on the RELX Board.

Conclusions from the 2023 Board evaluation
In 2023, the externally facilitated Board evaluation concluded that 
the Board continues to promote good governance and oversight 
and provides important challenge, insight and support to 
management, especially around key decisions. Each of the 
Committees is considered to be well-chaired and to be operating 
effectively. Board members who are not a member of a particular 
Committee reported that they feel appropriately informed of 
its activities. 

The overall culture and dynamics of the Board are considered  
to be very positive. There is a high degree of comfort in the 
decision-making process, supported by well-prepared papers, 
that takes into account the questions and input of the Non-
Executive Directors. Board and Committee meetings are 
well-planned, efficiently run and effectively cover the critical 
issues. The RELX strategy session in September was well 
received and the Board’s annual agenda is thought to have an 
appropriate balance of business and governance focus. Business 
and strategy materials from management are of a high quality 
and provide a sound basis for broad ranging debate and input 
from Board members. The Directors thought that the depth and 
breadth of capability and the diversity of thought and experience 
on the Board contributed to highly effective meetings. 

The key findings of the Board evaluation confirmed that the  
Board and its Committees continue to function effectively and 
collaboratively with an appropriate level of engagement with 
management. While there were no specific areas identified where 
significant improvement is required, the Board recognised the 
importance of continued focus on cyber security and its own  
role in the event of a significant incident. It considered that 
opportunities for optimising business growth should continue 
to feature in its future strategy discussions with management.

Audit, risk and internal control

Internal control and risk management  
The Board has overall responsibility for overseeing RELX’s 
systems of risk management and internal control and for 
monitoring the processes for identifying, assessing and managing 
the principal and emerging risks faced by the Company. These 
systems are designed to manage and mitigate, rather than totally 
eliminate, risks to the business. Accordingly, they can provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. These processes were in place throughout 
the year ended 31 December 2023, and up to the date of approval 
of the 2023 Annual Report. Further details of RELX’s risk 
management systems and the principal and emerging risks 
facing the Company, together with our mitigation strategies are 
set out on pages 98 to 103 of this Report. 

Risk management and control procedures are embedded into 
the operations of the business and include the monitoring of 
progress in areas for improvement that come to management 
and Board attention. 

To provide reasonable assurance against material inaccuracies 
or loss, and of the effectiveness of the systems of internal control 
and risk management, RELX has adopted the three lines of 
defence assurance model as set out below.

The report of the external auditor has been included from pages 158 to 165.

RELX operates authorisation and approval processes 
throughout its operations. Access controls exist where 
processes have been automated to ensure the security of data. 
Management information systems have been developed to identify 
risks and enable the assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
control systems.

With the close involvement of operating management and central 
functions, the risk management and control procedures aim to 
ensure that RELX is managing its business risks effectively and in 
a coordinated manner across the business areas with clarity on 
the respective responsibilities and interdependencies. Litigation, 
and other legal and regulatory matters, are managed by legal 
directors in the business areas. 

The Audit Committee has responsibility for monitoring RELX’s 
risk management and internal control procedures and reports to 
the Board, as appropriate. The Audit Committee receives periodic 
updates from RELX’s Chief Compliance Officer on alleged and 
substantiated violations of the Ethics Code, and related training, 
monitoring and communications programmes. Such updates 
covered the volume, type and circumstances surrounding 
substantiated violations, subsequent actions and lessons learnt.

During the year, RELX has continued to implement its inclusion 
strategy to advance progress towards its 2020 to 2025 inclusion 
goals. This covers all aspects of diversity and aims to translate 
the Group I&D Policy into tangible and measurable actions. 
Workforce policies and practices are regularly reviewed to ensure 
RELX is delivering on its inclusion, equity and diversity goals and 
effectively monitoring available diversity data. 

Across our business areas, we are committed to providing regular 
best practice and awareness training in areas such as inclusive 
leadership and unconscious bias and we promote and encourage 
inclusive networking groups and sponsorship and mentoring 
programmes. Details of the strategy and progress towards 
fulfilling our I&D initiatives is set out in our Corporate 
Responsibility Report on pages 54 to 59. 

Data for the diversity characteristics table on page 126 was drawn 
from HR information where consents are in place to use the data 
on an anonymised basis and through a survey with categories 
aligned to those set out in the LRs.

Board and Committee succession
When reviewing the composition of the Board and its Committees, 
the Nominations Committee considers, among other things,  
the length of tenure of each Director and the need for, and benefits 
of, membership being regularly refreshed. The Committee is 
cognisant of the skills and experience required for effective 
leadership and oversight of RELX’s strategy for success in the  
long term, and of the requirements of our Board I&D Policy and the 
UK Listing Rules designed to promote greater female and ethnic 
minority representation. All appointments to the RELX Board,  
and each of its Committees, are based primarily on merit and the 
suitability of an individual for any given role.

Board succession planning and refreshment was a regular 
agenda item at the Committee’s meetings during 2023. 
Dr Wolfhart Hauser retired at the Company’s annual general 
meeting in 2023 at which time he also stepped down as Senior 
Independent Director (SID), Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
and member of the Nominations Committee. The Committee 
recommended to the Board that Suzanne Wood be appointed to 
the role of SID and to membership of the Nominations Committee, 
and that Robert MacLeod succeed Dr Hauser as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. The Committee’s recommendations 
were based on its evaluation of the specific skills and experience 
required for each role, together with the capacity of individual 
directors to take up additional duties, and with regard to our 
diversity objectives.

The Committee also recommended the appointment of two new 
NEDs during the year: Alistair Cox, who joined the Board in  
April 2023, and Bianca Tetteroo who will join the Board in 2024, 
subject to her election by shareholders at the Company’s AGM,  
as announced on 8 December 2023. Marike van Lier Lels will  
retire at the Company’s AGM in 2024, having served on the Board 
since 2015. 

Director appointment process
A rigorous search and appointment process was followed for 
each new NED, starting with the preparation of a search 
specification, based on the Committee’s assessment of the skills 
and composition of the Board and the capabilities and experience 
required going forward. Russell Reynolds Associates was 
engaged to support the search and the Board confirms that 

none of the Directors have any connection with executive search  
firms utilised by the Company. A short-list of potentially suitable 
individuals was considered in detail by the Committee and 
preferred candidates were invited to meet with Board members, 
including the Chair and the Chief Executive Officer, together with 
the Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary. Following 
feedback from these sessions, the Nominations Committee made 
its recommendations to the Board. The Board then had a further 
opportunity to review and discuss the recommendations, and 
subsequently approved the appointments of Alistair Cox and 
Bianca Tetteroo.

The Board may appoint Directors (subject to a maximum upper 
limit) to fill a vacancy at any time, although any Director so 
appointed shall only hold office until the following AGM of the 
Company, at which his or her election shall be voted upon by 
shareholders. Directors are then required to seek re-election  
by shareholders at each subsequent AGM of the Company. As a 
general rule, letters of appointment for NEDs provide that, subject 
to annual re-election by shareholders, individuals will serve for  
an initial period of three years, and are typically expected to be 
available to serve for a second three-year period. If invited to do 
so, they may also serve for a third three-year period. The notice 
period applicable to the NEDs is one month. RELX’s Non-Executive 
Letter of Appointment sets out the time commitment required by 
the Company from its Non-Executive Directors. 

Executive and management succession
The Board is committed to recognising and nurturing talent 
across RELX and overseeing the development of a strong talent 
pipeline to senior leadership and executive roles. The Committee 
received detailed updates during the year from the Chief Executive 
Officer regarding succession plans for senior management roles. 
This included broad views on potential timings and implications for 
diversity. The Committee is satisfied that appropriate succession 
planning arrangements were in place during the year to facilitate 
appropriate and effective succession across senior management 
roles, supported by a strong pipeline of candidates.

Conflicts of interest
The Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which 
they have, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts 
with the interests of the Company and, if potential for such a 
conflict arises, must make such situations known to the Board.  
In accordance with its terms of reference, the Nominations 
Committee considers the circumstances of any such actual or 
potential conflicts of interest and makes a recommendation to the 
Board as to whether to authorise the conflict, as permitted under 
the Company’s Articles. The Committee may recommend that  
the Board imposes certain limits or conditions in respect of the 
conflict. There is a procedure in place for Directors to disclose any 
potential conflict to the Board and each Director is required to 
review and confirm their actual and potential conflicts annually. 
During the year, the Committee conducted a formal review of the 
conflict of interest authorisations granted by the Board to each 
individual Director. 

Committee evaluation
The evaluation of the Committee determined that it was well 
governed and effective in carrying out its role in accordance with 
its Terms of Reference. Details of the Board and Committee 
evaluation process are on page 123.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Directors’ Remuneration Report

The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) in accordance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the UK Listing Rules and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended (the UK Regulations). The Report was approved by the Board. 

I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2023. This is my first report as Chair of the 
Committee, having succeeded Wolfhart Hauser who retired from the Board in April 2023. I would like to thank Wolfhart for his valuable 
contribution and leadership of the Committee over the years.

As you will have seen earlier in the annual report, the Company delivered strong revenue and profit growth in 2023, driven by the ongoing 
shift in business mix towards higher growth information based analytics and decision tools that deliver enhanced value to our 
customers across market segments. We have been able to develop and deploy these tools across the Company for well over a decade 
and we are confident that our ability to leverage artificial intelligence and other technologies, as they evolve, will continue to be an 
important driver of customer value and growth in our business for many years to come. 

Underlying revenue growth was 8%, underlying adjusted operating profit growth was 13% and at constant currency, adjusted EPS 
growth was 11%. We are proposing an increase in the full-year dividend of 8%. Our Total Shareholder Return outperformed the FTSE 100 
over the last three, five and ten year periods as shown on page 138. 

The purpose of RELX is to benefit society by developing products that help researchers advance scientific knowledge; doctors and 
nurses improve the lives of patients; lawyers promote the rule of law and achieve justice and fair results for their clients; businesses and 
governments prevent fraud; consumers access financial services and get fair prices on insurance; and customers learn about markets 
and complete transactions. Our purpose guides our actions beyond the products that we develop. It defines us as a company. Every day 
across RELX our employees are inspired to undertake initiatives that make unique contributions to society and the communities in which 
we operate. We see what we do as a company as being an integral part of our commitment to environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) performance. We have set sustainability objectives which reflect our focus on our unique contributions to society and  
align to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to do our part to advance this ambitious global agenda by 2030.  
We are continuing to reduce our environmental impact to meet our 2025 environmental targets. Our performance was again recognised 
by external rating agencies: RELX achieved a AAA ESG rating with MSCI for an eighth consecutive year, was ranked second in our sector 
by Sustainalytics, maintained fifth place in the Responsibility 100 Index and was a constituent of the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index 
for the fifth consecutive year. More information can be found on pages 38 to 90. 

Remuneration policy and implementation
An updated Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 20 April 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM) with 95.87% in 
favour. I would like to express again my gratitude for the feedback received during the shareholder engagement as we were developing 
the policy and for the high level of support for the policy. The policy, which applies for three years from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM is 
set out on pages 142 to 148 of this report. The first awards under the policy will be granted in the first quarter of 2024. The 2023 awards 
are subject to the policy approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM and can be found on pages 90 to 96 of the 2019 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements, available on relx.com. 

Shareholders will be invited to vote (by way of an advisory vote) on the 2023 Annual Remuneration Report at the 2024 AGM.

Our strategic direction remains unchanged:  to develop increasingly sophisticated information-based analytics and decision tools that 
deliver enhanced value to professional and business customers across market segments.  We are primarily focused on organic growth, 
supported by targeted acquisitions. This should lead to a higher growth profile and a positive impact on society and, when combined with 
our strategy of driving continuous process innovation to manage cost growth below revenue growth, result in strong earnings growth 
and improving returns.

The performance measures in the incentive plans align with the strategy and the financial key performance indicators on page 6 of the 
annual report, by focusing on sustained earnings growth, return on invested capital and shareholder returns in the LTIP. The AIP is 
based on revenue, profit, cash flow and sustainability metrics and focuses on annual objectives and milestones and creates a platform 
for sustainable future performance. 

The performance measures are based on adjusted figures as they provide relevant information in assessing the Company’s 
performance, position and cash flows and we believe they track the core operational performance of RELX and how it contributes 
to shareholder value creation. The Annual Report includes a reconciliation of adjusted measures to IFRS measures.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Directors’ Remuneration Report

129

The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) in accordance with the 

UK Corporate Governance Code, the UK Listing Rules and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 

(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended (the UK Regulations). The Report was approved by the Board. 

2023 outcomes
RELX delivered strong organic revenue and adjusted operating profit growth rates. These results drove an AIP payout of 87% of the 
maximum. Details of our targets and achievements for the year are shown on pages 131 and 132.

I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2023. This is my first report as Chair of the 

Committee, having succeeded Wolfhart Hauser who retired from the Board in April 2023. I would like to thank Wolfhart for his valuable 

Financial and share price performance was very strong over the past three years, with TSR outperforming our UK, US and European 
peer groups. As a result, the LTIP payout is 100% of the maximum. Details of our targets and achievements are shown on page 133. 

In determining the level of payout under the annual and the multi-year incentives, the Committee took into account RELX’s overall 
business performance and value created for shareholders and other relevant factors and determined that the outcomes were fair 
and appropriate and applied no discretion to the payouts.

Broader employee considerations
The Board reviews information on employee metrics and updates on employee related matters including inclusion and diversity, as 
well as outcomes of employee surveys conducted during the year. In addition, our designated Non-Executive Director responsible for 
workforce engagement, Marike van Lier Lels, continued to meet with employee representatives from Europe, US and Asia Pacific during 
2023 and reported back to the Board. Further information on the workforce engagement process is provided in the Governance section 
on page 120. The Committee also reviews annual salary increase guidelines globally. 

When determining the remuneration for Executive Directors and Senior Executives, the Committee considers business and individual 
performance as well as other factors including broader employee reward.

The Committee is satisfied that the overall remuneration for Executive Directors is appropriate and fair having considered external  
and internal relativities.

The Committee is satisfied that the incentive schemes drive the desired behaviours to support the Company’s purpose, values  
and strategy. 

Implementation of the Remuneration Policy in 2024
The Committee has approved 2024 salary increases for the Executive Directors of 2.5%. 

As highlighted in the 2022 report and in accordance with the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM, the level 
of vesting for threshold performance in the LTIP will reduce from 25% of the maximum opportunity to 20% and incentives will be subject 
to broader malus and clawback provisions. 

The Committee also approved a new US clawback policy in compliance with new US listing standards adopted in June 2023, providing for 
the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation by current or former executive officers, in the event the company is 
required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the 
securities laws. Our malus and clawback policy includes broader triggers than the US clawback requirements (see page 144).

Further details regarding the implementation of the policy in 2024 can be found on page 140.

governments prevent fraud; consumers access financial services and get fair prices on insurance; and customers learn about markets 

and complete transactions. Our purpose guides our actions beyond the products that we develop. It defines us as a company. Every day 

across RELX our employees are inspired to undertake initiatives that make unique contributions to society and the communities in which 

we operate. We see what we do as a company as being an integral part of our commitment to environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) performance. We have set sustainability objectives which reflect our focus on our unique contributions to society and  

align to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to do our part to advance this ambitious global agenda by 2030.  

We are continuing to reduce our environmental impact to meet our 2025 environmental targets. Our performance was again recognised 

by external rating agencies: RELX achieved a AAA ESG rating with MSCI for an eighth consecutive year, was ranked second in our sector 

by Sustainalytics, maintained fifth place in the Responsibility 100 Index and was a constituent of the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index 

for the fifth consecutive year. More information can be found on pages 38 to 90. 

Remuneration policy and implementation

An updated Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 20 April 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM) with 95.87% in 

favour. I would like to express again my gratitude for the feedback received during the shareholder engagement as we were developing 

the policy and for the high level of support for the policy. The policy, which applies for three years from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM is 

set out on pages 142 to 148 of this report. The first awards under the policy will be granted in the first quarter of 2024. The 2023 awards 

are subject to the policy approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM and can be found on pages 90 to 96 of the 2019 Annual Report and 

Financial Statements, available on relx.com. 

Shareholders will be invited to vote (by way of an advisory vote) on the 2023 Annual Remuneration Report at the 2024 AGM.

Our strategic direction remains unchanged:  to develop increasingly sophisticated information-based analytics and decision tools that 

deliver enhanced value to professional and business customers across market segments.  We are primarily focused on organic growth, 

supported by targeted acquisitions. This should lead to a higher growth profile and a positive impact on society and, when combined with 

our strategy of driving continuous process innovation to manage cost growth below revenue growth, result in strong earnings growth 

and improving returns.

The performance measures in the incentive plans align with the strategy and the financial key performance indicators on page 6 of the 

annual report, by focusing on sustained earnings growth, return on invested capital and shareholder returns in the LTIP. The AIP is 

based on revenue, profit, cash flow and sustainability metrics and focuses on annual objectives and milestones and creates a platform 

for sustainable future performance. 

The performance measures are based on adjusted figures as they provide relevant information in assessing the Company’s 

performance, position and cash flows and we believe they track the core operational performance of RELX and how it contributes 

to shareholder value creation. The Annual Report includes a reconciliation of adjusted measures to IFRS measures.

(1)  Benefits are typically comprised of a car allowance, private medical/dental insurance and the cost of tax return preparation.

(2)  50% of the AIP is paid in shares deferred for three years. Dividend equivalents accrue on these shares.

(3)  The 2023 figures reflect the vesting of the 2021–2023 cycle of the LTIP. As the LTIP vests after the approval date of this Report, the 

average share price for the last quarter of 2023 has been used to arrive at an estimated figure in respect of these awards, in line with 
the methodology prescribed by the UK Regulations. 

The estimated figures for 2022 disclosed in last year’s Report have been restated to reflect the actual amount of the 2020-2022 
cycle of the LTIP vested and the actual share price, which increased the 2022 disclosed figure by £383k for the CEO and by £188k for 
the CFO. The vesting percentage was determined on 17 February 2023 and was in line with the one disclosed on page 127 of the 2022 
Remuneration Report.

For Erik Engstrom, the amount that directly reflects share price appreciation is £0.8m for 2022 and £3.4m for 2023. For Nick Luff, 
these numbers are £0.4m for 2022 and £1.7m for 2023. 

The awards are due to vest in February 2024 and the 2023 figures will be restated in next year’s report to reflect actual values  
at vesting.

(4)  Erik Engstrom and Nick Luff received cash in lieu of pension of 11% of base salary in 2023. 

 (5)  Total fixed remuneration includes base salary, benefits and pension. Total variable remuneration includes annual incentive 

and share based awards.

Some figures and subtotals add up to different amounts than the totals due to rounding. 

The total remuneration for Directors is set out in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.

The AIP and LTIP performance measures and targets are shown on the following pages.

(1)   Targets are set on an underlying basis for revenue and on a constant currency basis for adjusted net profit, and reflect targeted growth, with cash flow based on the 

targeted cash conversion. Target amounts presented in sterling reflect actual movements in exchange rates relative to their equivalent constant currency amounts. 

(2)   The maximum for each measure is 150% of on target. The overall maximum is 200% of salary.

As highlighted earlier, underlying revenue growth was 8%. Underlying adjusted operating profit growth was 13% and at constant currency, adjusted EPS growth was 11%. 
Some figures add up to different amounts than the totals due to rounding.

50% of the AIP will be paid in cash in Q1 2024 and the remainder is paid in Deferred Shares which will be released in Q1 2027. The release 
of Deferred Shares is not subject to any further performance conditions but is subject to malus and clawback.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Non-financial measures 
We have set sustainability objectives which reflect our focus on our unique contributions to society, as well as sustainability  issues 
more broadly. We align all our objectives to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to do our part to advance this 
ambitious global agenda by 2030. 

We have chosen to include sustainability metrics in the AIP so that we can update these metrics depending on current situation. 

Purchase of renewable electricity is no longer a specific measure this year as the target has been met. We will however continue 
to track this metric and may consider including again if relevant. 

We have replaced the previous metric regarding the number of strategic partners to the RELX SDG Resource centre with a metric 
related to the number of users of the SDG Resource centre. The Universal access to information measure therefore reflects not only 
the Company’s efforts to provide access to information by increasing content on the Resource centre, but also measures the use of 
the centre. 

Our environmental targets align with our 2025 targets. More information can be found on pages 73 to 80.

Non-financial measures represent 10% of the AIP. Of this component, achievements and payouts were as follows:

Payout for carbon reduction was capped at 90% of target in the year in recognition of the changes in office work patterns and business 
travel since the target was set.

Set out below is a summary of performance against each measure of the LTIP cycle 1 January 2021–31 December 2023. 

The targets remained unchanged from when these were set at the beginning of 2021. As noted in the Chair letter, financial performance 
was very strong and significant value was generated for shareholders through share price appreciation and dividends over the 
performance period. RELX’s TSR outperformed the UK, US and European peer groups over the period. The payout is 100% of maximum.

In addition, an intercontinental travel fee of £4,500 was payable to any Non-Executive Director (excluding the Chair) in respect of each 
transatlantic journey made in order to attend a RELX Board or Committee meeting during 2023.

Fees may be reviewed annually, although in practice they have changed on a less frequent basis. Before the changes which took effect 
on 1 January 2024, the Chair fee was last changed in 2018 and the NED base fee was last changed in 2020. The new fees represent a per 
annum increase slightly below the general UK employee salary increase guidelines of 2.5%. Other NED fees were last amended in 2016 
or 2018.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Directors’ Remuneration Report

135

Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and other share interests (audited)
Shareholding requirement 
The Committee believes that a closer alignment of interests can be created between senior management and shareholders if executives 
build and maintain a significant personal stake in RELX. The shareholding requirements applicable to the Executive Directors are set 
out in the table below. Shares that count for this purpose are (i) any type of RELX security of which the Director, their spouse, civil partner 
or dependent child has beneficial ownership of and (ii) AIP deferred shares which are within their three-year deferral period, on a 
notional net (after tax) basis. There has been no change to the interests reported below between 31 December 2023 and the date of this 
Report.

Meeting the shareholding requirement is both a vesting condition for LTIP awards granted and a requirement to maintain eligibility for 
future LTIP awards. On termination of employment, Executive Directors are to maintain their full shareholding requirement (or, if lower, 
their actual level of shareholding at the time of leaving) for two years after leaving employment. 

On 31 December 2023, the Executive Directors’ shareholdings were as follows: 

Erik Engstrom
Nick Luff

Shareholding requirement  
(% of 2023 annual base salary)
450%
300%

Shareholding as at 
31 December 2023 (% of 2023

1217%

(1)   Includes AIP deferred shares which are within their three-year deferral period, on a notional net (after tax) basis (63,845 for Erik Engstrom and 37,596 for Nick Luff).
For disclosure purposes, any PLC ADRs held are included as ordinary shares.

The total remuneration for Directors is set out in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.

N/A. The release of AIP deferred shares in Q1 2026 is not subject to any 
further performance conditions, but is subject to malus and clawback.

(1)   The face value of the LTIP awards and AIP deferred shares granted in February 2023 was calculated using the middle market quotation of a PLC ordinary share (£24.92). 

This share price was used to determine the number of awards granted.

The LTIP awards granted in 2023 are based on ROIC, EPS and TSR weighted 40%:40%:20% respectively and assessed independently. 
The targets and vesting scales applicable to these awards are set out on page 134 of the 2022 Remuneration Report.

We chose Option A as we believe it is the most robust and accurate 
way to identify the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile 
UK employee. 

The Committee is satisfied that the overall picture presented 
by the 2023 pay ratios is consistent with the pay, reward and 
progression policies for the Group’s UK employees.

	§ Salaries for all UK employees, including the Executive 

Directors, are set based on a wide range of factors, including 
market practice, scope and impact of the role and experience. 

	§ The provision of certain benefits and the level of benefit 

provided vary depending on the role and level of seniority. 

	§ Participation in annual incentive plans varies by business and 
reflects the culture and the nature of the business, as well 
as role. 

	§ Whilst none of the comparator employees participate in the 

executive share plans, they do have the opportunity to receive 
company shares via the UK Sharesave Option Plan. A greater 
proportion of performance-related variable pay and share 
based awards applies to more senior executives, including  
the Executive Directors, who have a greater influence over 
performance outcomes.

 Relative importance of spend on pay

employees, as well as the amounts paid in dividends and 
share repurchases.

share based and related remuneration. 

Payments to past Directors and payments for loss of office 
(audited)
There have been no payments for loss of office in 2023.

Comparison of change in Directors’ pay with change  
in employee pay
The UK Regulations require companies to disclose the percentage 
change in remuneration from 2022 to 2023 for each director 
compared with the employees of the listed company, excluding 
directors. RELX PLC has no employees and Executive Directors 
are the only employees of RELX Group PLC. We therefore have 
no data to report but have chosen to continue to report data on 
changes in base salary of the CEO compared with changes in base 
salary of a broader employee population. The salary increase for 
the CEO of 2.5% was below the average increase for the broader 
UK and US workforce, and significantly below the increases for 
our lower paid employees. 

UK pay ratios
The UK Regulations require the disclosure of the ratio of total 
CEO remuneration to median (P50), 25th percentile (P25) and 75th 
percentile (P75) UK employee total remuneration (calculated on 
a full-time equivalent basis). UK employees represent less than 
20% of our global employee population. 

Pay ratios for total remuneration are likely to vary, potentially 
significantly, over time, since the CEO’s total remuneration each 
year is driven largely by performance-related pay outcomes and is 
affected by share price movements. We have therefore also shown 
the UK ratios for the salary component. 

For the purposes of the ratios below, the CEO’s 2023 total 
remuneration is the total single figure and salary as disclosed  
on page 130. The P25, P50 and P75 were selected from the UK 
employee population as at 1 October 2023. Ratios for prior 
years are as disclosed in the respective reports.

Slight differences compared with ratios calculated using data 
shown in the tables are due to rounding.

The ratios are calculated using Option A, meaning that the 
median, 25th and 75th percentiles were determined based on total 
remuneration using the single total figure valuation methodology, 
except for annual incentives (other than sales incentives) which 
are based on estimated payout as individual final payout levels 
are still to be finalised.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Implementation of remuneration policy in 2024
Salary: The Committee has awarded a salary increase of 2.5% to 
each Executive Director, which means that, from 1 January 2024, 
Erik Engstrom’s salary rose to £1,412,974 and Nick Luff’s salary 
to £832,055. 

Benefits: The benefits provided to the Executive Directors are 
unchanged for 2024.

Annual incentive: The AIP payout at target performance is 135% 
of base salary and the maximum 200% of base salary, with 50% 
of the AIP earned deferred into shares. Revenue, adjusted net 
profit after tax and cash flow each have a weight of 30% and 
non-financial a weight of 10%. Non-financial measures are 
focused on sustainability metrics. Details of the 2024 annual 
financial targets and non-financial metrics will be disclosed in 
the 2024 Remuneration Report.

Pension: Erik Engstrom and Nick Luff will receive cash in lieu of 
pension of 11% of their salary. 

Share based awards: As in 2023, we will be granting LTIP awards 
with face values of 450% of salary to Erik Engstrom and 375% 
to Nick Luff in 2024. The awards are subject to a three-year 
performance period and the net (after tax) vested shares are 
to be retained for a further two-year holding period. As highlighted 
earlier, the level of vesting for threshold performance is reduced 
to 20%.

The following metrics, weightings, targets and vesting scales 
apply to LTIP awards granted in 2024 for the 2024–2026 cycle.

The vesting of LTIP awards is dependent on three separate 
performance measures: ROIC, EPS and TSR weighted 
40%:40%:20% respectively and assessed independently.

The TSR measure comprises three comparators (sterling, 
euro and US dollar) reflecting the fact that RELX accesses equity 
capital markets through three exchanges – London, Amsterdam 
and New York – in three currency zones. RELX’s TSR performance 
is measured separately against each comparator group and 
each ranking achieved will produce a payout, if any, in respect 
of one-third of the TSR measure. The proportion of the TSR 
measure that vests will be the sum of the three payouts.

The averaging period applied for TSR measurement purposes is 
the three months before the start of the financial year in which the 
award is granted and the last three months of the third financial 
year of the performance period.

The companies for the TSR comparator groups for the 2024–2026 
LTIP cycle were selected on the following basis (substantially 
unchanged from prior year):

(a)   they were in a relevant market index or were the largest 

listed companies on the relevant exchanges at the end of the 
year before the start of the performance period: the FTSE 100 
for the sterling group; the Euronext100 and Dax40 for the euro 
group; and the S&P 500 for the US dollar group;

(b)  certain companies were then excluded:

	§ those with mainly domestic or single country revenues 

(as they do not reflect the global nature of RELX’s 
customer base);

	§ those engaged in extractive industries (as they are 

exposed to commodity cycles); and

	§ financial services companies (as they have a different 

risk/reward profile).

(c)   the remaining companies were then ranked by market 
capitalisation and, for each comparator group, around 
50 companies with market capitalisations above and 
below that of RELX were taken; and 

(d)   relevant listed global peers operating in businesses similar 
to those of RELX, but not otherwise included, were added.

Remuneration Policy Report

Set out in this section is the Company’s Remuneration Policy for Directors, as approved by shareholders at the 20 April 2023 Annual 
General Meeting, and which is intended to apply for three years from the AGM and to awards granted from the first quarter of 2024.

Remuneration policy table – Executive Directors

ANNUAL BASE SALARY

Purpose and link to strategy
To recruit and retain the best executive talent globally to execute our strategic objectives at appropriate cost.
Operation
Salaries for Executive Directors are set and reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) with changes typically 
taking effect on 1 January. In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may review salaries more frequently.

When reviewing salaries, the Committee considers the executive’s role and sustained value to the Company in terms of skill, experience 
and overall contribution and the Company’s guidelines for salaries for all employees for the year. Periodically, competitiveness with 
companies which are comparable in respect of industry, size, international scope and complexity is also considered in order to ensure 
the Company’s ability to attract and retain executives.

Performance framework
N/A
Maximum value
Salary increases will continue to be aligned with the range of increases for the wider employee population and subject to annual 
all-employee guidelines. However, as for all employees, the Committee has discretion to exceed this to take account of individual 
circumstances such as change in responsibility, increases in scale or complexity of the business or alignment to market level.
Recovery of sums paid
No provision.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Purpose and link to strategy
Retirement plans are part of remuneration packages designed to recruit and retain the best executive talent at appropriate cost.
Operation
Executive Directors receive pension benefits up to the value equivalent to the maximum level of pension benefits provided under the 
Company’s regular defined contribution pension plans as may be in effect or amended from time to time (currently 11% of base salary  
in the UK). The defined contribution pension plans are designed to be competitive and sustainable long-term. Any amount payable may 
be paid wholly or partly as cash in lieu. 
Performance framework
N/A
Maximum value
The maximum value is equivalent to the maximum level of pension benefits provided under the Company’s regular defined contribution 
pension plans as may be in effect or amended from time to time (currently capped at 11% of base salary in the UK).

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Directors’ Remuneration Report

143

Set out in this section is the Company’s Remuneration Policy for Directors, as approved by shareholders at the 20 April 2023 Annual 

General Meeting, and which is intended to apply for three years from the AGM and to awards granted from the first quarter of 2024. 

OTHER BENEFITS
Purpose and link to strategy
To provide competitive benefits at appropriate cost.

Operation
Other benefits, subject to periodic review, may include private medical and dental cover, life assurance, tax return preparation costs, 
car benefits, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, relocation benefits and expatriate allowances and other benefits available to 
employees generally, including, where appropriate, the tax on such benefits.
Performance framework
N/A
Maximum value
The maximum for ongoing benefits for Executive Directors will not normally exceed 10% of salary (excluding any one-off items,  
such as immigration support or relocation benefits, and any tax related charge on benefits which is met by the Company). However,  
the Committee may provide reasonable benefits beyond this amount in exceptional situations, such as a change in the individual’s 
circumstances caused by the Company, or if there is a significant increase in the cost of providing the agreed benefit.

ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN (AIP)
Purpose and link to strategy
The annual incentive provides focus on the delivery of annual financial targets and the achievement of annual objectives and milestones 
which are chosen to align with the Company’s strategy and create a platform for sustainable future performance. The compulsory 
deferral of 50% of any annual incentive earned into RELX shares for three years promotes longer-term alignment of Executive Directors’ 
interests with shareholders’ interests, including an element of post-termination shareholding.
Why performance measures are chosen and how targets are set
Performance measures include a balanced set of financial measures which are appropriately weighted and which support current 
strategy and incentivise the Executive Directors to achieve the desired outcomes without undue risk of focusing on any one financial 
measure. The financial targets are designed to be challenging and are set with reference to the previous year’s performance and 
internal and external forecasts for the following year.

Performance measures may also include non-financial measures, for example linked to sustainability.
Operation
The Committee reviews and sets the financial targets and, if applicable, non-financial targets, annually, taking into account internal 
forecasts and strategic plans. Following year end, the Committee compares actual performance with the financial targets and assesses 
the achievement of any non-financial targets. The targets and outcomes are fully disclosed in the Remuneration Report published after 
year end.

50% of any annual incentive earned is paid in cash to the Executive Director and the remaining 50% is deferred into RELX shares, which 
are released to the Executive Director after three years. Dividend equivalents accrued during the deferral period are payable in respect 
of the shares. On a change in control, the default position is that deferred shares are released to the Executive Director. Alternatively, 
the Committee may determine that deferred shares will instead be exchanged for equivalent share awards in the acquiring company.
Performance framework
The AIP includes financial measures with a weighting of at least 85% and may also include non-financial measures with a weighting of up 
to 15%. Each measure is assessed separately.

	§ The minimum payout is zero.
	§ Each measure is assessed independently and payout for each measure at threshold is 10% of the maximum opportunity for that 

measure. 

	§ Payout for target performance is 135% of salary.

Following an assessment of financial achievement, and scoring of any non-financial measures, the Committee agrees the overall level 
of earned incentive for each Executive Director.

Committee discretion applies.1,2,3
Maximum value
The maximum potential annual incentive is 200% of annual base salary. This includes the deferred share element but excludes dividend 
equivalents payable in respect of the deferred shares.
Recovery of sums paid
Clawback applies.4

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
Purpose and link to strategy
The Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is designed to provide a long-term incentive for Executive Directors to achieve the key performance 
measures that support the Company’s strategy, and to align their interests with shareholders.
Why performance measures are chosen and how targets are set
Our strategic focus is on continuing to transform the core business through organic investment and the build-out of new products into 
adjacent markets and geographies, supplemented by selective portfolio acquisitions and divestments. The performance measures in 
the LTIP are chosen to support this strategy by focusing on sustained earnings growth, return on invested capital and shareholder return.

Targets are set with regard to previous results and internal and external forecasts for the performance period and the strategic plan for 
the business. They are designed to provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance, whilst allowing a reasonable expectation 
that reward at the lower end of the scale is attainable, subject to robust performance.
Operation
Annual awards of performance shares, with vesting subject to:

	§ performance measured over three financial years
	§ continued employment (subject to the provisions set out in the Policy on payments for loss of office section)
	§ meeting shareholding requirements (450% of salary for the CEO and 300% of salary for the CFO)

Executive Directors are to retain their net (after tax) vested shares for a holding period of two years after vesting. Dividend equivalents 
accrued during the performance period are payable in respect of the performance shares that vest.

On a change of control, the default position is that awards vest on a pro-rated basis, subject to an assessment of performance against 
targets at that time. Alternatively, the Committee may determine that the awards will not vest and will instead be exchanged for 
equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
Performance framework
The performance measures are EPS, ROIC and relative TSR, weighted 40%:40%:20% respectively and assessed independently, 
such that a payout can be received under any one of the measures (or, for TSR, in respect of one of the three comparator groups).

	§ The minimum payout is zero.
	§ Each measure is assessed independently and payout for each measure at threshold is 20% of the maximum opportunity for  

that measure. 

	§ Payout in line with expectations is 50% of the maximum award.

Dividend equivalents are not taken into account in the above payout levels. 

Committee discretion applies.1,2,3
Maximum value
The maximum grant in any year is up to 450% of base salary for the CEO and up to 375% of base salary for other Executive Directors 
(not including dividend equivalents).
Recovery of sums paid
Clawback applies.4

Notes to the Remuneration policy table 
(1) 

 Discretion in respect of AIP and LTIP payout levels: In determining the level of payout under the AIP and vesting under the LTIP, the 
Committee takes into account RELX’s overall business performance and value created for shareholders over the period in review 
and other relevant factors. It has discretion to adjust the vesting and payout levels (subject always to the maximum individual limits)  
if it believes this would result in a fairer outcome. This discretion will only be used in exceptional circumstances and the Committee will 
explain in the next Remuneration Report the extent to which it has been exercised and the reasons for doing so.

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

 Discretion to vary performance measures under the AIP and the LTIP: The Committee may vary the financial measures applying to a 
current annual incentive year and performance measures for LTIP awards already granted if a change in circumstances leads it to believe 
that the arrangement is no longer a fair measure of performance. Any new measures will not be materially less, or more, challenging than 
the original ones. 
 Discretion on termination of employment under the AIP and the LTIP: The Committee’s discretion on termination of employment is 
described under the ‘Policy on payments for loss of office’ section.
 Malus and clawback under the AIP and the LTIP: Under the AIP and the LTIP, the Committee has discretion to apply malus and clawback in 
case of material misstatement of results or erroneous calculation in incentive payout; breach of post-termination restrictive covenants; 
misconduct; fraud or conduct which results in (i) significant reputational damage; (ii) material adverse effect on the financial position of the 
Company; or (iii) corporate failure. These apply for three years following the AIP cash payment and five years from the start of each LTIP 
performance period and, in the case of a breach of restrictive covenants, to the end of the restriction period. If a participant is subject to an 
internal investigation regarding a serious breach of any of the above matters, the vesting of their awards and the application of malus and 
clawback may be delayed until the outcome of that investigation.

internal investigation regarding a serious breach of any of the above matters, the vesting of their awards and the application of malus and 

clawback may be delayed until the outcome of that investigation.

(5) 

 Explanation of differences between the Company’s policy on Executive Directors’ remuneration and the policy for other employees: 
A larger percentage of Executive Directors’ remuneration is performance related than that of other employees. All managers participate 
in an annual incentive plan. Participation levels, measures and targets vary according to their role, seniority and local business priorities. 
Senior executives may also participate in multi-year equity plans. Grant levels under the plans vary according to roles and seniority. 
The range and level of retirement and other benefits provided to employees vary according to local market practice.

Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios
The Committee considers the level of remuneration that may be paid in the context of the performance delivered and value added for 
shareholders. The charts below are an illustration of how the CEO’s and CFO’s regular annual remuneration could vary under different 
performance scenarios. The salary, benefits and pension levels are the same in all three scenarios in each chart and are based on 2023 
salary, benefits as shown in the 2022 Single Total Figure table and cash in lieu of pension of 11% of base salary. Annual incentive amounts 
include the portion which is subject to compulsory deferral into RELX shares for three years. The performance assumptions which 
have been used are as follows: Minimum means no AIP payout and no LTIP vesting. In line with expectations means AIP payout at 135% 
of salary (of which 50% is deferred into shares) and LTIP vesting at 50% of the award. Maximum means AIP payout at 200% of salary 
(of which 50% is deferred into shares) and LTIP vesting at 100% of the award. The three bars in each chart assume no share price 
movement. As required by the UK Regulations, assuming maximum performance achievement (as described above) and 50% share 
price growth over the performance period, the CEO’s maximum remuneration would increase to £13.7 m and the CFO’s maximum 
remuneration to £7.1m. Any dividend equivalents payable in respect of the AIP deferred shares and the LTIP are not included.

Shareholding requirement
The Executive Directors are subject to shareholding requirements. These are a minimum of 450% of annual base salary for the CEO and 
300% of annual base salary for other Executive Directors. On joining or promotion to the Board, Executive Directors are given a period of 
time, typically up to five years, to build up to their requirement. On termination of employment, Executive Directors are to maintain their 
full shareholding requirement (or, if lower, their actual level of shareholding at the time of leaving) for two years after leaving employment.

Shares which count for shareholding purposes are shares beneficially owned by the Executive Director, their spouse, civil partner or 
dependent child and AIP deferred shares which are within their three-year deferral period, on a notional net of tax basis.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Approach to recruitment remuneration – Executive Directors
When agreeing the components of a remuneration package on the appointment of a new Executive Director, or an internal promotion 
to the Board, the Committee would seek to align the package with the remuneration policy stated in the policy table.

The Committee’s general principle on recruitment is to offer a competitive remuneration package to attract high-calibre candidates 
from a global talent pool. Basic salary would be set at an appropriate level for the candidate, taking into account all relevant factors.  
As a data analytics and technology-driven business, with over half of its revenue in the US, the Company primarily competes for talent 
with global information and technology companies.

The various components and the Company’s approach are as follows:

REMUNERATION COMPONENTS
The remuneration would include base salary, retirement benefits, other benefits, AIP and LTIP in line with the policy table, taking into 
account the principles set out above.
COMPENSATION FOR FORFEITED ENTITLEMENTS
The Committee may make awards and payments on hiring an external candidate to compensate him or her for entitlements forfeited 
on leaving the previous employer. If such a decision is made, the Committee will attempt to reflect previous entitlements as closely as 
possible using a variety of tools, including cash and share based awards. Malus and clawback provisions will apply where appropriate.  
If necessary to facilitate the grant of awards, the Committee may rely on the one person exemption from shareholder approval in the  
UK Listing Rules.
RELOCATION ALLOWANCES AND EXPENSES
The type and size of relocation allowances and expenses will be determined by the specific circumstances of the new recruit.

Policy on payments for loss of office
In line with the Company’s policy, the service contracts of the existing Executive Directors contain 12-month notice periods.

The circumstances in which an Executive Director’s employment is terminated will affect the Committee’s determination of any payment 
for loss of office, but it expects to apply the principles outlined in the table on the next page. The Committee reserves the right to depart 
from these principles where appropriate in light of any taxation requirements to which the Company or the Executive Director is subject 
(including, without limitation, section 409A of the US Internal Revenue Code), or other legal obligations.

Policy on payments for loss of office (continued)

GENERAL(1)

INCENTIVES

Mutually agreed termination/termination by the Company other than for cause(2)
(includes retirement with customary notice)

The Executive Director would be entitled to salary, benefits  
and other contractual payments in the normal way up to the 
termination date and would be paid for any accrued but 
untaken holiday.

Salary: Payment of up to 12 months’ salary to reflect the notice 
period or payment in lieu of notice.

Other benefits: Where possible, benefits would be continued for 
up to the duration of any unworked period of notice (not exceeding 
the maximum stated in the policy table) or the Executive Director 
would receive a cash payment (not exceeding the cost to the 
Company of providing those benefits).

Pension: Deferred or immediate pension in accordance with 
scheme rules, with a credit in respect of, or payment for up to, 
the full period of any unworked period of notice. There is provision 
under the defined benefit pension scheme for members leaving 
Company service by reason of permanent incapacity to make  
an application to the scheme trustee for early payment of  
their pension.

Other: The Company may pay compensation in respect of any 
statutory employment rights and may make other appropriate 
and customary payments. 

The Company would have due regard to principles of mitigation 
of loss. Reductions would be applied to reflect any portion of the 
notice period that is worked and/or spent on gardening leave.

On injury, disability, ill-health or death, the Committee reserves 
the right to vary the treatment outlined in this section.

Employee instigated resignation
The Executive Director would not receive any payments for 
loss of office. The Executive Director would be entitled to salary, 
benefits and other contractual payments in the normal way up 
to the termination date and would be paid for any accrued but 
untaken holiday.

Pension: A deferred or immediate pension would be payable 
in accordance with the scheme rules.

Dismissal for cause
The Executive Director would be entitled to salary, benefits 
and other contractual payments in the normal way up to the 
termination date and would be paid for any accrued but untaken 
holiday but would not receive any payments for loss of office. 

Pension: A deferred or immediate pension would be payable 
in accordance with the scheme rules.

Annual incentive: Any unpaid annual incentive for the previous year 
and a pro-rata payment in respect of the part of the financial year 
up to the termination date would generally be payable (subject 
to the deferral provisions), with the amount being determined 
by reference to the original performance criteria. However, the 
Committee has discretion to decide otherwise depending on 
the reason for termination and other specific circumstances. 
The Company would not pay any annual incentive in respect of any 
part of the financial year following the termination date (e.g. for 
any unworked period of notice). AIP deferred shares would be 
released to the Executive Directors in full at the end of the deferral 
period. The annual incentive clawback provisions would apply. 

LTIP: The default position is that unvested LTIP awards would be 
pro-rated to reflect time employed and would vest subject to 
performance measured at the end of the relevant performance 
period and subject to the Executive Director continuing to 
meet their full shareholding requirement for two years after the 
termination date. The Committee has discretion to allow unvested 
LTIP awards to vest earlier and to adjust the application of time 
pro-rating and performance conditions, subject to the plan rules. 
The requirement to retain net (after tax) vested LTIP shares for 
a holding period of two years after vesting ceases to apply on 
termination of employment.

Annual incentive: The Executive Director would be entitled to 
receive an annual incentive for a completed previous year (subject 
to the deferral provisions), but not a pro-rated annual incentive 
in respect of a part year up to the termination date, unless the 
Committee decides otherwise in the specific circumstances. Any 
AIP deferred shares would be released to the Executive Director 
in full at the end of the deferral period. Annual incentive clawback 
provisions would apply. 

LTIP: All outstanding LTIP awards would lapse on the date of notice.
Annual incentive: The Executive Director would not receive any 
unpaid annual incentive. Any AIP deferred shares lapse on the  
date of dismissal.

LTIP: All outstanding LTIP awards would lapse on the date  
of dismissal.

(1)   In addition to what is set out in this section, on termination for any reason, Erik Engstrom will be entitled to payment of amounts held in his ‘Retirement Account’. 
(2)   In cases where the approved leaver treatment applies, the AIP and LTIP have a default position as well as giving the Committee discretion to adjust the default treatment 
within certain parameters. The Committee would only expect to exercise such discretion where the Committee believes the personal circumstances of the Executive 
Director so require.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Remuneration policy table – Non-Executive Directors

FEES
Purpose and link to strategy
To enable RELX to recruit Non-Executive Directors with the right balance of personal skills and experience to make a major contribution 
to the Board and Committees of a global business which is listed in London, Amsterdam and New York.
Operation
RELX Chair: Receives an aggregate annual fee with no additional fees, for example, Committee Chair fees. The Committee determines 
the Chair’s fee on the advice of the Senior Independent Director. 

Other Non-Executive Directors: Receive an annual fee with additional fees payable as appropriate for specific roles and duties. 
These additional fees include fees for the Senior Independent Director and Committee Chairs, for membership of Board Committees, 
as well as a workforce engagement fee and international travel fees. In future, other fees may be payable, for example attendance fees. 
The Board determines the level of fees, subject to applicable law.

Fees may be reviewed annually, although in practice they have changed on a less frequent basis. When reviewing fees, consideration is 
given to the time commitment required, the complexity of the role and the calibre of the individual. Periodically, comparative market data 
is also reviewed, the primary source for which is the practice of FTSE 30 companies.
Maximum value
The aggregate annual fee limit for fees paid to the Chair and the Non-Executive Directors is £2m. Additional fees for membership of or 
chairing Board Committees and assuming additional responsibilities such as acting as Senior Independent Director, are not subject to 
this maximum limit.

OTHER BENEFITS
Purpose and link to strategy
To provide competitive benefits at appropriate cost.
Operation
Other benefits for Non-Executive Directors are reviewed periodically and may include private medical cover, tax return preparation 
costs, secretarial benefits, car benefits, travel and related subsistence costs, including, where appropriate, the tax on such benefits.
Maximum value
There is no prescribed maximum amount.

Approach to recruitment remuneration – Non-Executive 
Directors
Following recruitment, a new Non-Executive Director will 
be entitled to fees and other benefits in accordance with the 
Company’s remuneration policy. No additional remuneration 
is paid on recruitment. However, any reasonable expenses 
incurred during the recruitment process will be reimbursed.

Policy on payments for loss of office – Non-Executive Directors 
In addition to unpaid accrued fees, the Non-Executive Directors 
are entitled to receive one month’s fees for loss of office if their 
appointment is terminated before the end of its term.

Service contracts and letters of appointment
There are no further obligations in the Directors’ service contracts 
and letters of appointment which are not otherwise disclosed in 
this Report which could give rise to a remuneration payment or 
loss of office payment. All Directors’ service contracts and letters 
of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office. The Executive Directors’ service contracts do 
not have a fixed expiry date.

Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Company 
When the Committee reviews the Executive Directors’ salaries 
annually, it takes into account the Company’s guidelines for 
salaries for all employees in the Company’s major operating 
locations for the forthcoming year. The Committee also considers 
market practice in the FTSE 30 as well as pay practices of other 
global information and technology companies when determining 
the quantum and structure of Directors’ pay.

The Committee annually reviews various aspects of workforce 
remuneration and related policies in order to deepen its 
understanding of pay structures throughout the organisation.

Our designated Non-Executive Director responsible for workforce 
engagement meets with employees representing our global 
employee population in order to understand a wide range of 
employee views on a variety of topics. The feedback is reported 
back to the Board at least once per year and forms part of the 
Board’s discussions and decision making. As part of this process, 
the Non-Executive Director explains how executive remuneration 
aligns with wider pay policy.

Consideration of shareholder views
Our practice is to consult shareholders and consider their views 
when formulating, or changing, our policy. The Committee took 
into account feedback received from shareholders since the prior 
policy was approved when reviewing the current policy. 

Previous remuneration policies and prior commitments
Any payments which are still to be made under arrangements 
made and awards granted under previous remuneration policies 
will be made consistent with the applicable policy. The provisions 
of the previous policies which relate to arrangements and awards 
granted under those previous policies will therefore continue to 
apply until all payments in relation to those arrangements and 
awards have been made. The Committee also reserves the right  
to make any remuneration or loss of office payments if the terms 
were agreed prior to the approval of the 2013 or 2016 policy or 
prior to an individual being appointed as a Director.

Minor amendments
The Committee may make minor amendments for regulatory, 
tax or administrative purpose.

AREAS OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT AND ESTIMATION 

    NOTE AND PAGE 
REFERENCE  
IN ANNUAL REPORT 

Specific areas of significant accounting judgement and estimation, as set out in note 1 on page 171, reviewed and 
challenged by the Committee were: 

  Capitalisation of internally developed intangible assets: The capitalisation of costs related to the development 
of new products and business infrastructure, together with the useful economic lives applied to the resulting 
assets, requires the exercise of judgement. The Committee received reports from the Group Financial 
Controller on the amounts capitalised and asset lives selected for major projects and outcome of impairment 
assessment performed.

OTHER AREAS OF FOCUS 
Other areas discussed by the Committee during the year were: 

   PAGE REFERENCE  
IN ANNUAL REPORT 

  Taxation: The valuation of provisions in relation to uncertain tax positions involves estimation. The Committee 
received and discussed reports from the Head of Tax on the potential liabilities identified and assumptions used. 

  182-185 

  Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets: The judgements and estimates in respect of asset carrying 

values relate to the assumptions underlying the value in use calculations such as discount rates and  
long-term growth assumptions. The Committee received and discussed reports from the Group Financial 
Controller on the methodology, the basis of assumptions used and headroom resulting from the annual 
impairment assessment 

190-192 

  Acquired intangible assets: The identification of separate intangible assets on acquisition requires judgement. 
Estimation is required in determining the future cash flows and discount rates used to value these assets.  
The Committee received and discussed reports from the Group Financial Controller on the methodology and 
the basis of the assumptions used 

  190-192 

  Financing: Judgement is required in assessing the sufficiency and adequacy of current and future liquidity and 
funding requirements of the Group. The Committee received and discussed reports from the Group Treasurer 
on the Group’s financing including the issue of €750m euro-denominated term debt with a coupon of 3.75% 
and maturity of eight years, extension of the maturity date on the $3bn revolving credit facility to April 2026 
and redemption of a $200m bond and related swap maturing in August 2027. See below for further information 
in respect of the Committee’s review of the going concern and viability assessments and related disclosure 

  194-198 

The Committee was satisfied that all the above items had been appropriately considered and presented in the 
Annual Report.

  38-89 

This includes disclosures in respect of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
recommendations 

The Committee was satisfied that all relevant disclosures have been appropriately made. 

FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE 
The Committee considered whether the 2023 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable. In making this assessment,  
the Committee considered the following areas: 

  The process for preparing the Annual Report, including the contributors, the internal review process and how feedback is 

addressed throughout the process

Risk management and internal controls 
With respect to their oversight of risk management and internal 
controls, the Committee has: 

  Committee meetings 

  received and discussed regular reports summarising  
the status of the Group’s risk management activities, 
identification of emerging risks and actions to mitigate risks, 
and the findings from internal audits and status of actions 
agreed with management. Areas of focus in 2023 included: 
cyber security (including the ability to prevent, respond to and 
recover from a cyber-attack or ransomware attack); data 
privacy; the operational, financial and IT control environment; 
the use of technology including machine learning; regulatory 
compliance; business continuity and resilience (including 
supplier resilience and plans for extreme weather events); 
the ability to adapt to geopolitical, economic and market 
conditions; integrity of published Corporate Responsibility 
data; and continued compliance with the requirements of 
Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act relating to the 
documentation and testing of internal controls over  
financial reporting  

  received regular updates from the Group Financial Controller 
and Group Treasurer on the Group’s financial position including 
on liquidity, extension of maturity of the revolving credit 
facility to April 2026, bond issue, early redemption of a bond, 
credit ratings and ability to access debt capital markets, 
changes to the regulatory reporting landscape including  
the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, risk 
management and compliance with treasury policies, and 
pension arrangements and funding 

  received presentations from the Head of Tax on tax matters 

and the Group’s tax principles 

  reviewed and approved the internal audit plan for 2024 and 
monitored execution of the 2023 plan, including progress in 
respect of actions agreed 

  received presentations from the Chief Compliance Officer  
on the compliance programmes, including the operation  
of the RELX Code of Conduct, training programmes and 
whistleblowing arrangements 

  received presentations from the Chief Legal Officer on legal 

issues and claims 

  received an update from the Group Financial Controller in 
respect of the ‘Audit Committees and the External Audit: 
Minimum Standard’ published by the Financial Reporting 
Council in May 2023. The RELX Audit Committee, as it 
currently operates, already aligns with most of the 
requirements and will continue to monitor future 
developments in this area with respect to disclosures  
to be included in future reports by the Audit Committee  
on a ‘comply or explain basis’  

  participated in a series of ‘deep dive’ briefing sessions with 
senior management from each of the Business Areas on a 
range of topics 

  received comprehensive briefings from the external  

auditor and RELX management on the UK Government’s 
proposed measures on Corporate Reform and the Financial 
Reporting Council’s proposed revisions to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and other regulatory matters 

The Committee met four times during 2023. The Audit 
Committee meetings are typically attended by the Board Chair, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Group Financial Controller, the Chief Legal Officer, the Head of 
Internal Audit & Assurance (IAA), and audit partners from the 
external auditors. 

External audit effectiveness and independence 
The Group has a well-established policy on audit effectiveness 
and independence of auditors that sets out among other things: 
the responsibilities of the Audit Committee in the selection of 
auditors to be proposed for appointment or re-appointment 
and for agreement on the terms of their engagement, scope 
and remuneration; the auditor independence requirements and 
the policy on the provision of non-audit services; the rotation of 
audit partners and staff; and the conduct of meetings between 
the auditors and the Audit Committee. 

The Committee’s policy on the use of the external auditor to 
provide non-audit services is in accordance with applicable 
laws and takes into account the relevant ethical guidance for 
auditors. Any permissible non-audit services must be pre-
approved by the Chief Financial Officer and above £50,000,  
by the Chair of the Audit Committee. All non-audit services 
provided and fees are presented to the Committee on a  
regular basis. 

The policy is available on the website, 

 www.relx.com. 

The Committee has conducted its review of the performance  
of the external auditors and effectiveness of the external  
audit process for the year ended 31 December 2023.  
The review included: 

  an assessment of the quality of the auditor’s reporting to 

and interaction with the Audit Committee 

  review of the completion of the audit plan and changes to 

risks identified or work performed 

  a discussion with EY on data analytics tools used in the audit; 
  consideration of public reports by regulatory authorities on 
key EY member firms and their view on the effectiveness of 
EY’s audits 

  a survey of key stakeholders across RELX evaluating the 

performance of each audit team 

The Audit Committee holds private meetings with the  
external auditor to encourage open and transparent feedback. 
The Chair of the Committee also met with the external auditors 
outside of Committee meetings supporting effective and  
timely communication. 

Based on this review, the Audit Committee was satisfied with 
the performance of the auditors and the effectiveness of the 
audit process. The external auditors have confirmed their 
independence and compliance with the policy on auditor 
independence to the Audit Committee.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

RELX   Annual Report 2023  |  Governance 

Non-audit services 
The external auditors are precluded from engaging in non-audit 
services that would compromise their independence or violate 
any professional requirements or regulations affecting their 
appointment as auditors. The auditors may, however, provide 
non-audit services which do not conflict with their independence. 

The Committee has reviewed and agreed the non-audit services 
provided in 2023 together with the associated fees. The non-
audit services provided in 2023 were very limited and, in line 
with the latest FRC guidance, linked to audit work such as a 
bond issue and corporate responsibility data assurance. 

The total fees payable to EY for the year ended 31 December 
2023 were £9.1m of which £0.7m related to non-audit work. 
Further details are provided in note 4 to the financial statements. 

The non-audit fees remain below the 70% threshold as per the 
most recent FRC guidance. 

Auditor appointment 
EY were first appointed auditor of RELX PLC for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2016. The auditor is required to rotate 
the lead audit partner responsible for the engagement every  
five years. The year ended 31 December 2023 was the third year 
for the lead audit partner, Colin Brown. The Audit Committee 
confirms that they were in compliance with the provisions of  
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 during the 
financial year ended 31 December 2023. In accordance with  
the terms of this Order, RELX anticipates that it will conduct  
a competitive tender process during 2024 with respect to the 
audit for the year ended 31 December 2026. The Committee 
believes this approach is in the best interests of shareholders 
and will provide sufficient time to allow for an orderly transition 
in the event of a change in auditor.  

Having considered the summary set out above relating to the 
effectiveness and independence of EY, the Committee was 
satisfied and has recommended to the Board that a Resolution 
to re-appoint EY as auditors for the year ending 31 December 
2024 be proposed at the 2024 AGM which the Board has 
accepted and endorsed. 

Internal audit 
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference requires an annual 
review of internal audit effectiveness. RELX has an established 
Internal Audit function governed by a formal charter which 
requires an external assessment at least once every five years 
to consider and report on conformance with the Institute of 
Internal Auditors International Professional Practices 
Framework (IPPF) and UK Chartered Institute of Internal 
Auditors Internal Audit Code of Practice (CoP). 

An external assessment of internal audit was carried out in 
2022. The assessment identified areas of enhancement related 
to strategy, planning, operational excellence, and talent.  
All recommendations have been implemented.     

The Audit Committee annually receives and considers a report 
from the Head of IAA on: the independence of the internal audit 
activity; a review of the IAA Charter; conformance with the 
mandatory elements of the IPPF and CoP; and the results  
of its quality assurance and improvement programme. 

Audit Committee effectiveness 
The effectiveness of the Audit Committee was reviewed as part 
of the 2023 evaluation of the Board which confirmed that the 
Committee continues to function effectively. Details of the 
evaluation are set out on page 112.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Authority to purchase own shares
At the Company’s 2023 AGM, shareholders passed a resolution 
authorising the purchase of up to 193,584,144 ordinary shares  
in the Company (representing approximately 10% of the issued 
ordinary shares) by way of market purchase. This authority  
will expire at the 2024 AGM, when a resolution to renew  
the authority to purchase Company shares will be submitted  
to shareholders. During the year, 30,912,126 ordinary shares  
of 14 51⁄116 p each (representing 1.6% of the ordinary shares in issue 
at 31 December 2023) were purchased by the Company for a total 
consideration of £800m, including expenses, and subsequently 
transferred to be held in treasury. A further 4,627,481 shares were 
purchased between 2 January 2024 and the date of this report.  
On 7 December 2023, the Company cancelled 31m ordinary shares 
held in treasury. Therefore, as at 31 December 2023 there were 
19,712,193 ordinary shares held in treasury, representing 1% of  
the ordinary shares in issue. The purpose of the share buyback 
programme is to reduce the capital of the Company.

Share issuance
At the 2023 AGM, shareholders passed a resolution authorising 
the Directors to issue shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis 
up to a nominal value of £13,784,103, representing approximately 
5% of the Company’s issued share capital, and authorising the 
Directors to issue up to an additional 5% of the issued share  
capital for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis in connection with  
an acquisition or specified investment. Since the 2023 AGM, no 
shares have been issued under this authority. The shareholder 
authority also permits the Directors to issue shares in order to 
satisfy entitlements under employee share plans and details of 
such allotments are described below.

During the year, 3,027,517 ordinary shares in the Company were 
issued in order to satisfy entitlements under employee share 
plans as follows: 669,028 under the UK SAYE Share Option Scheme 
at prices between 1,178p and 1,976p per share; 153,166 under the 
legacy Dutch Debenture Scheme at prices between 9.561 EUR and 
19.39 EUR , which is satisfied by way of Company shares; and 
2,205,323 under executive share option schemes at prices 
between 734.5p and 2,492p per share.

arrangements between the Company and its Directors or 
employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs specifically because of a takeover, 
merger or amalgamation with the exception of provisions in the 
Company’s share plans which could result in options or awards 
vesting or becoming exercisable on a change of control. No 
contract existed during the year in relation to the Company’s 
business in which any Director was materially interested.

on behalf of the Board, to determine the external auditor’s 
remuneration, will be put to shareholders at the Company’s  
2024 AGM.

Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the directors in office as at the date of this Annual Report 
confirms that:

	§ so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 

information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and

	§ he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken 
as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
have prepared consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with International Accounting Standards (IAS) in conformity with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Directors 
have elected to prepare the individual Company financial 
statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 

Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit 
or loss of the Company and of the Group for that period.

In preparing the individual Company’s financial statements,  
the Directors are required to: 

	§ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 

consistently;

	§ make judgements and accounting estimates that are 

reasonable and prudent; 

	§ state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework has been followed, subject to any 
material departures being disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and

	§ prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.

In preparing the Group financial statements, IAS 1 requires  
that Directors: 

	§ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 

consistently; 

	§ properly select and apply accounting policies; present 
information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;

	§ provide additional disclosures when compliance  

with the specific requirements of IFRS are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions or other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance; and

	§ make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as 

a going concern.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the Annual Report and financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

The Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic report, 
Directors’ report, Annual report on remuneration, and Corporate 
governance report in compliance with applicable  
laws and regulations. The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Each of the Directors confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:

	§ the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with UK-adopted IAS in conformity with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group;

	§ the individual Company financial statements, prepared in 

accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101), gives a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company;

	§ the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal and emerging risks 
and uncertainties that it faces; and

	§ the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy.

■  Verifying the credit facilities available to the Group including, inspection of the one year extension of the $3bn revolving credit 

facility to April 2026, which was concluded in March 2023. Additionally, we obtained independent external confirmation that the 
$3bn revolving credit facility remains undrawn with no financial covenants in place.   

■  Reviewing management’s reverse stress testing to assess the likelihood of factors that would lead to the Group running out of 

all available liquidity during the going concern period.   

■  Reviewing the Group’s going concern disclosures included in the annual report to assess that the disclosures are consistent 

with the basis upon which the Board have concluded, and in conformity with the reporting standards. 

In management’s base case and stress case scenarios, there is significant headroom without taking into consideration the benefit 
of any identified controllable mitigations.  

Within management’s stress case scenario, which assumes no access to the capital markets, the Group would still have liquidity on 
its undrawn $3bn revolving credit facility which does not contain any financial covenants. 

We have not identified going concern to be a key audit matter.  

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for  
a period of 18 months from the balance sheet date to 30 June 2025.  

In relation to the group and parent company’s reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the 
directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting. 

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections  
of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH 

Audit scope 

■  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of five components and audit procedures on 
specific balances for a further one component. We also instructed one additional component to perform 
specified audit procedures on specific balances. 

■  The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 71% of Profit before 

tax on an absolute basis, 73% of Revenue and 87% of Total Assets. 

Key audit matters 

■  Uncertain tax positions – risk that the tax provisions may be incorrectly quantified, including the trigger for 

recognition or release, impacting the provision and the effective tax rate.  

■  Revenue recognition – there is a fraud risk to misstate revenue through manual adjustments or override of 

controls by management.  

Materiality 

■  Overall Group materiality of £115m which represents 5% of profit before tax. 

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF THE PARENT COMPANY AND GROUP AUDITS  
Tailoring the scope 
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the 
business environment, the potential impact of climate change and other factors such as recent internal audit results when 
assessing the level of work to be performed at each component. 

The Group has centralised processes for key judgements and determination of accounting policies. One key audit matter,  
namely revenue recognition, reflects more decentralised processes delineated by business area. We have tailored our response 
accordingly and procedures were performed by the component teams with oversight from the primary audit team. 

In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, we selected 7 components covering entities primarily within the UK, 
Netherlands and US, which represent the principal business units within the Group. 

Of the 7 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 5 components (“full scope 
components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.  

For 1 component (“specific scope component”), we performed full audit procedures on specific accounts within that component 
that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because 
of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.  

For 1 further component (“specified procedures component”), we performed certain audit procedures on specific accounts within 
that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements 
either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. These procedures included revenue procedures as detailed in the 
Key audit matters section, obtaining bank confirmations for significant bank accounts and testing the carrying value of intangible 
assets and joint ventures as well as key IT general controls.

Of the other remaining components that together represent 23% of the Group’s profit before tax on an absolute basis, none are 
individually greater than 1.5% of the Group’s profit before tax on an absolute basis. For these components, we performed other 
procedures, including analytical review, review of internal audit reports, testing of entity level and group wide controls, testing  
of IT general controls supporting certain IT applications, testing of consolidation journals, intercompany eliminations and foreign 
currency translation recalculations and review for evidence of material contracts that would require testing at the group level to 
respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.

1. 2 of the 5 full scope components (Risk US and Legal US) are audited by a component audit team based in the US, with 1 full scope component (STM) audited 
by a component audit team in the Netherlands and the remaining 2 full scope components (Risk UK and Legal UK) audited by UK component audit teams.  
2. The specific scope component relates to finance and corporate entities. The primary audit team performed full audit procedures on specific accounts across 
a range of significant accounts selected. The audit procedures did not include testing of all significant accounts of this component but will have contributed 
to the coverage of significant accounts selected for testing by the group audit team. 

3. The specified procedures component represents the Exhibitions business. The procedures were performed by a separate UK component audit team.  

The audit scope of this component may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of 
significant accounts selected for testing by the group audit team.

*  Coverage of profit before tax measure on an absolute basis for each component (components with a loss would be added to both the numerator and 

denominator) 

Changes from the prior year  
We have made the following changes to our audit approach this year: 

1.  In the prior year, the Exhibitions component in the UK was designated as a full scope component and those in the USA, Japan and 
France were designated as specific scope components. On the basis that no individual component within the Exhibitions business 
contributes more than 2.5% of absolute profit before tax, and due to the predictability of the business, we have adopted a centralised 
approach to our work this year. We have performed certain audit procedures over the entire Exhibitions business, which has 
incorporated a level of unpredictability to our work, for example, selecting a sample of revenue contracts across the entire Exhibitions 
business, rather than within specific entities. 

2.  Legal France has been reassessed as an ‘other remaining component’ this year, compared to a specific scope component in the prior 
year. Legal France now contributes less than 1.5% of revenue, absolute profit before tax and assets to the Group. On the basis that the 
likelihood of material misstatement is low, we have not identified any areas of concern in the previous years’ audits and there are no 
significant internal audit findings, we have decided to remove this as a specific scope component. 

3.  In the prior year, specified procedures were performed over a revenue stream which has, in the current year, been split between 

components, a portion of which falls within our Risk US and Risk UK full scope components. 

Involvement with component teams  
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating 
under our instruction. Of the 5 full scope components and 1 specific scope component, audit procedures were performed on 2 of 
the full scope components and the specific scope component directly by the primary and UK component audit teams. For the other 
3 components, where the work was performed by overseas component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement 
to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole. 

The primary audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior 
Statutory Auditor or another Group audit partner, visit all full scope and specific scope locations over a one year cycle. During the 
current year’s audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the primary audit team to the component teams in the UK, the US and the 
Netherlands. These visits involved meetings with local management and discussions with the component team on the audit 
approach and any issues arising from their work. The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams, where 
appropriate, during various stages of the audit, reviewed relevant working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction 
of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements. 

CLIMATE CHANGE  
Stakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact companies. The Group has determined that the  
most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be from global warming and extreme weather events.  
These are explained on pages 82-89 in the Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures, which form part of the “Other 
information,” rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted 
solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on “Other information”.

opinion on the Group financial statements. 

CLIMATE CHANGE  

Stakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact companies. The Group has determined that the  

most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be from global warming and extreme weather events.  

These are explained on pages 82-89 in the Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures, which form part of the “Other 

information,” rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted 

solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 

course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on “Other information”.   

In planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group’s business and any 
consequential material impact on its financial statements.  

The Group has explained in Note 1, Basis of Preparation, how they have assessed assets with indefinite and long lives which could 
be impacted by measures taken to address global warming. Management concluded that the Group’s operations and the use of 
Group’s products have a relatively low environmental impact, and no issues were identified by management that would impact the 
carrying value of such assets or have any other material impact on the financial statements.  

Our audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating management’s 
assessment of the impact of climate risk, physical and transition and their climate commitments. This included evaluation, with the 
support of our climate change internal specialists, of management’s assessment of the risk of impairment due to climate change 
did not constitute a significant judgement or estimate. We also performed a risk assessment to determine whether there were 
other risks of material misstatement from climate change in the financial statements which needed to be considered in our audit.   

We also challenged the Directors’ considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability and 
associated disclosures.   

Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to 
impact a key audit matter.  

Key audit matters  
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 

KEY OBSERVATIONS 
COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT 
COMMITTEE  
We reported to the Audit 
Committee that we 
challenged the robustness  
of the key management 
judgements around the 
trigger for recognition or 
release impacting the 
provision and the effective 
tax rate. We confirmed that 
we were satisfied that 
management’s judgements 
in relation to the quantum of 
provisions for uncertain tax 
positions are appropriate and 
in accordance with IAS 12: 
Income Taxes. We also 
consider the tax disclosures to 
be sufficient and appropriate. 

RISK 
Uncertain tax positions  
As described in note 9 to the consolidated 
financial statements, note 1 in the 
accounting policies and in the audit 
committee report (page 143), the Group is 
subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions.  
Provisions related to uncertain tax 
positions totalled £173m as at  
31 December 2023 (2022: £239m).  
The Group’s operational structure  
gives rise to potential tax exposures  
that require management  
to exercise judgement in making 
determinations as to the amount of  
tax that is payable. The Group reports 
cross-border transactions undertaken 
between subsidiaries on an arm’s-length 
basis in tax returns in accordance with 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) guidelines. 
Transfer pricing relies on the exercise of 
judgement and it is reasonably possible 
for there to be a significant range of 
potential outcomes.  
As a result, the Group has recognised 
provisions for uncertain tax positions, the 
valuation of which requires judgement,  
as described in note 9.   

We focused on this area due to the 
complexity and the subjectivity in the 
quantification of the provision and the 
judgement around the trigger for 
recognition or release impacting the 
provision and the effective tax rate.   

OUR RESPONSE TO THE RISK 
Our procedures included obtaining an understanding  
of the tax provisioning processes and evaluating the 
design of, as well as testing, internal controls over  
the tax provisioning process. We tested controls over 
management’s review of the uncertain tax position 
provisions recorded, including the review of significant 
assumptions and judgements.  

Our procedures on the uncertain tax positions were 
performed centrally by the primary team and supported 
by overseas teams including professionals with 
specialised skills.  Procedures included: 

(i)   meeting with members of management responsible 
for tax to understand the Group’s cross-border 
transactions, status of significant provisions, and any 
changes to management’s judgements in the year;  

(ii)  reading correspondence with tax authorities and 

external advisors and obtaining an understanding  
of all matters considered by management to inform 
our assessment of recorded estimates and evaluate 
the completeness of the provisions recorded;  
(iii) independently assessing management’s significant 
assumptions and judgements to record, release  
or re-measure provisions following tax audits, 
settlements and the expiry of timeframes with 
reference to other similar tax positions the Group 
has historically held and our knowledge of 
developments in the jurisdictions in which RELX 
maintain tax provisions;  

(iv)  testing the underlying schedules for arithmetic 

accuracy, as well as with reference to applicable  
tax laws; and  

(v)  evaluating the adequacy of disclosures related to 

uncertain tax positions.

RISK 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue recognition is described in  
note 2 to the consolidated financial 
statements. The Group recognises 
revenue (£9.2bn recorded in 2023, 
compared to £8.6bn recorded in 2022) 
from a variety of sources among the 
different business areas, including 
annual subscriptions, transactional 
usage and exhibition fees. 

We recognise that revenue is a key 
metric upon which the Group is judged, 
that the Group has annual internal 
targets, and that the Group has incentive 
schemes that are partially impacted by 
revenue growth.  

We have determined that there is a  
fraud risk to misstate revenue through 
manual adjustments or override of 
controls by management.  

OUR RESPONSE TO THE RISK 
We performed full scope audit procedures over revenue 
in 5 components, which covered 73% of revenue  
and performed revenue procedures at 1 specified 
procedures component which covered 11% of revenue. 
We performed procedures to address the specific risk  
in each business area.  

Procedures at full scope components included: 

(i)   assessing the processes and testing controls over 

each significant revenue stream;  

(ii)  evaluating the appropriateness of journal entries 
impacting revenue, as well as other adjustments  
made in the preparation of the financial statements; 

(iii) evaluating management’s controls over such 

adjustments;  

(iv)  inspecting a sample of customer contracts to check 
that revenue recognition was in accordance with the 
contract terms and the Group’s revenue recognition 
policies, which is in line with IFRS 15; 

(v)   testing a sample of transactions around period  
end to test that revenue was recorded in the  
correct period; 

(vi)  for revenue streams that have judgemental 

elements, evaluating management’s assumptions  
and critically challenging these assumptions  
against contractual terms and underlying  
financial information; 

(vii) obtaining audit evidence through the execution  

of data analytics procedures, including correlation 
analyses from revenue to cash. 

Procedures at the specified procedures component 
included: 

(i)  substantive analytical review; 

(ii)  inspecting a sample of customer contracts to check 
that revenue recognition was in accordance with the 
contract terms and the Group’s revenue recognition 
policies, which is in line with IFRS 15; 

(iii) evaluating the appropriateness of consolidation 

journal entries impacting revenue at the component 
level, as well as other adjustments made in the 
preparation of the component level financial 
statements. 

The procedures we performed over the remaining 16%  
of revenue included:  

(i)   testing of entity level and group wide controls;  

(ii)  analytical review of year over year movements in 

revenue;  

(iii) review for evidence of material contracts that would 

require further testing.

OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY  
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the 
audit and in forming our audit opinion.   

Materiality 
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures.  

We determined materiality for the Group to be £115 million (2022: £100 million), which is 5% (2022: 4.73%) of profit before tax.  
We believe that profit before tax provides us with the most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the entity and 
therefore have determined materiality based on this number.   

We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be £115 million (2022: £100 million), which is 0.6% (2022: 0.5%) of equity.   

Performance materiality 
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality. 

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement 
was that performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £86m (2022: £75m). We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage due to our assessment of the control environment and the historic lack of significant 
audit findings. 

Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based 
on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that 
component.  In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £26m to £86m (2022: £15m  
to £75m).  

Reporting threshold 
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial. 

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £6m (2022: £5m), 
which is set at 5% (2022: 5%) of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.   

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. 

Other information  
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1-155, including the Strategic 
Report and the Governance report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are 
responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.  

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated  
in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. 

We have nothing to report in this regard. 

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 

■  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 

are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and  

■  the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

RELX   Annual report 2023 | Financial Statements and other information  

Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. 

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 

■  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 

received from branches not visited by us; or 

■  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 

with the accounting records and returns; or 

■  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 

■  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit 

Corporate Governance Statement 
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the group and company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review by the Listing Rules. 

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 
Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit: 

■  Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 

uncertainties identified set out on page 105; 

■  Directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period 

is appropriate set out on page 105; 

■  Director’s statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meets 

its liabilities set out on page 105; 

■  Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 150; 

■  Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 98; 

■  The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set 

out on page 124; and; 

The section describing the work of the audit committee set out on page 149. 

Responsibilities of directors 
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 155, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as 
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.  

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so. 

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.   

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud  
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with  
our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement  
due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by,  
for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of 
detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. 

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the 
company and management.  

■  We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most 
significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IASB, IFRS, UK adopted International Accounting Standards, FRS 101,  
the Companies Act 2006, UK Corporate Governance Code, the US Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the Listing Rules of the UK 
Listing Authority) and relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates and the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR).

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 

high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material

aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud  

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with  

our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement  

due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by,  

for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of 

detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. 

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the 

company and management.  

■  We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most 

significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IASB, IFRS, UK adopted International Accounting Standards, FRS 101,  

the Companies Act 2006, UK Corporate Governance Code, the US Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the Listing Rules of the UK 

Listing Authority) and relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates and the EU General Data 

Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

■  We understood how RELX PLC is complying with those frameworks by making inquiries of management, internal audit, those 

responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of 
Board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee, observations in Audit Committee meetings, as well as consideration of the 
results of our audit procedures across the Group. 

■  We assessed the susceptibility of the group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by 

meeting the finance and operational management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was 
susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to 
manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that 
otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was 
considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included those on 
revenue recognition referred to in the Key audit matters section and testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements were free from material fraud or error. 

■  Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our 

procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large or unusual 
transactions based on our understanding of the business; and enquiries of legal counsel, Group management, internal audit and 
business area management at all full and specific scope locations. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance 
of the disclosures in the annual report and accounts with all applicable requirements. 

Any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations were communicated by/to components and considered in our audit 
approach, if applicable.  

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. 

OTHER MATTERS WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS  
■  Following the recommendation from the audit committee we were appointed by the company on 21 April 2016 to audit the financial 

statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 and subsequent financial periods. 

The period of uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is eight years, covering the years ending 2016 
to 2023.  

■  The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee. 

USE OF OUR REPORT 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.

The consolidated financial statements include other areas of judgement and accounting estimates. These include: 

■  Taxation: The valuation of provisions related to uncertain tax positions involves estimation (see note 9) 
■  Goodwill: The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill requires management judgement and estimation to determine the  

value in use of the businesses (see note 14). 

■  Acquired intangible assets: Judgement is involved in identification of separate intangible assets on acquisition and estimation is 

required to determine future cashflows and discount rates used in valuation (see note 14).

2 Revenue, operating profit and segment analysis 

Accounting policy 
The Group’s reported segments are based on the internal reporting structure and financial information provided to the Board. 

Adjusted operating profit is the key segmental profit measure used by the Group in assessing performance. Adjusted operating 
profit is reconciled to operating profit on page 175. 

Revenue arises from the provision of products and services under contracts with customers. In all cases, revenue is 
recognised to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to 
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and is recognised when the customer obtains 
control of the goods or service. 

Revenue is stated at the transaction price, which includes allowance for anticipated discounts and returns and excludes 
customer sales taxes and other amounts to be collected on behalf of third-parties. 

Where the goods or services promised within a contract are distinct, they are identified as separate performance obligations 
and are accounted for separately. 

Where separate performance obligations are identified, total revenue is allocated on the basis of relative standalone selling 
prices or management’s best estimate of relative value where standalone selling prices do not exist. Management estimates 
may include a cost-plus method or comparable product approach, but must be supported by objective evidence. A residual 
approach may be applied where it is not possible to derive a reliable management estimate for a specific component. 

Our subscription and exhibition related revenue streams generally require payment in advance of the service being provided. 
Payment terms offered to customers are in line with the standard in the markets and geographies we operate in, and contracts 
do not contain significant financing components. Contracts for our transactional electronic revenue streams generally have 
payments that vary with volume of usage. Other than that, our contracts do not involve variable consideration. 

Revenue is recognised for the various categories as follows: 

■  Subscriptions – revenue comprises income derived from the periodic distribution or update of a product. Subscription 

revenue is generally invoiced in advance and recognised systematically over the period of the subscription. Recognition is 
either on a straight-line basis where the transaction involves the transfer of goods and services to the customer in a 
consistent manner over a specific period of time; or based on the value received by the customer where the goods and 
services are not delivered in a consistent manner 

■  Transactional – revenue is recognised when control of the product is passed to the customer or the service has been 

performed. For exhibitions, revenue primarily comprises income from exhibitors and attendees at exhibitions. Exhibition 
revenue is recognised on occurrence of the exhibition

The share of post-tax results of joint ventures and associates included in operating profit was £46m (2022: £19m; 2021: £29m). This 
comprised of profit/(loss) relating to Risk £(1)m (2022: £2m; 2021: £4m), Legal £10m (2022: £7m; 2021: £6m) and Exhibitions £37m 
(2022: £10m; 2021: £19m). 

In 2022, unallocated central costs and other operating items includes a charge of £24m relating to STM incurred from exchange 
rate movements from the translation of working capital items such as accounts receivable and payable, and intercompany 
balances, into relevant functional currencies and the outcome of STM’s hedging programme. The net effect of these amounts was 
higher in 2022 due to the extent and timing of exchange rate movements in the year and such amounts were insignificant in 2023 
and 2021. In 2021, unallocated central costs and other operating items includes a £35m one-off charge relating to reductions in our 
corporate real estate footprint.

*  Europe includes revenue of £602m from the United Kingdom (2022: £544m; 2021: £476m). 

Over half of RELX’s revenue comes from subscription arrangements, and revenue for these is generally recognised on a straight-
line basis over the time period covered by the agreement, in line with the provision of services. 

There are a number of multi-year contracts, mainly in Risk, where revenue is recognised on the achievement of delivery 
milestones or other specified performance obligations. As at 31 December 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price of 
such contracts which relates to performance obligations which have not yet been delivered was approximately £83m (2022: £100m). 
It is expected that revenue will be recognised in relation to this amount over the next four years.

Amounts payable to the auditors of the Group’s subsidiaries include amounts for the audit of internal controls over financial 
reporting in accordance with the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The decrease in the 2023 audit fee is mainly due to changes in scope and 
foreign exchange movements. The previously reported 2022 fees paid to EY for audit services have been revised to include final 
fees for statutory audits which took place subsequent to the audit of the RELX consolidated accounts.

Accounting policy 
Share based remuneration 
The fair value of share based remuneration is determined at the date of grant and recognised as an expense in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, taking account of the estimated number of shares that are expected 
to vest. Market based performance criteria are taken into account when determining the fair value at the date of grant. Non-
market based performance criteria are taken into account when estimating the number of shares expected to vest. The fair 
value of share based remuneration is determined by use of a binomial or Monte Carlo simulation model as appropriate. All of 
the Group’s share based remuneration is equity settled.

Staff costs above exclude cost of contractors and employer costs of benefits provided to employees but include amounts that are 
capitalised. The Group provides a number of share based remuneration schemes to directors and employees. The principal share 
based remuneration schemes are the Executive Share Option Schemes (ESOS), the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the 
Retention Share Plan (RSP). Share options granted under ESOS are exercisable after three years and up to ten years from the date

are exercisable after three years for nil consideration if conditions are met. Other awards principally relate to all employee share 
based saving schemes in the UK, the US and the Netherlands. Further details are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 128

6 Pension schemes 

Accounting policy 
The expense of defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement employee benefits is determined using the 
projected unit credit method and charged in the income statement as an operating expense, based on actuarial assumptions 
reflecting market conditions at the beginning of the financial year. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. 

Past service costs and credits are recognised immediately at the earlier of when plan amendments or curtailments occur and 
when related restructuring costs or termination benefits are recognised. Settlements are recognised when they occur. 

Net pension obligations in respect of defined benefit schemes are included in the statement of financial position at the present 
value of scheme liabilities, less the fair value of scheme assets. Where schemes are in surplus, i.e. assets exceed liabilities, 
the net pension assets are separately included in the statement of financial position. Any net pension asset is limited to the 
extent that the asset is recoverable.  

The expense of defined contribution pension schemes and other employee benefits is charged in the income statement as incurred. 

At 31 December 2023, the Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and the US. These schemes require 
management to exercise judgement in: estimating the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits, especially given 
the length of each scheme’s liabilities and; for funded schemes in an accounting surplus position, whether the surplus can  
be recognised. 

Key source of estimation uncertainty 
Accounting for defined benefit pension schemes involves judgement and estimation about uncertain events, including the life 
expectancy of the members, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted. Estimates for these 
factors are used in determining the pension cost and liabilities reported in the financial statements. The estimates made 
around future developments of each of the critical assumptions are made in conjunction with independent actuaries. Each 
scheme is subject to a periodic review by independent actuaries. The discount rate, inflation rate and mortality assumptions 
may have a material effect in determining the defined benefit pension obligation and costs which are reported in the financial 
statements. Information regarding the more significant assumptions used for valuation is provided below, together with a 
sensitivity analysis. 

A number of pension schemes are operated around the world. The largest funded defined benefit schemes as at 31 December 2023 
were in the UK and the US, and are summarised below. In addition, there are a number of smaller unfunded schemes in the UK 
and the US. 

Major defined benefit schemes in place at 31 December 2023 
The UK scheme is a final salary scheme and is closed to new hires. Members accrue a portion of their final pensionable earnings 
based on the number of years of service. The US scheme is a cash balance scheme and is closed to future accruals effective  
1 January 2019. 

Each of the major defined benefit schemes is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group. The trustees of  
the pension funds in the UK and plan fiduciaries of the US scheme are required by law to act in the interest of the funds’ beneficiaries.  

In the UK, the trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. The 
board of trustees consists of an equal number of company-appointed and member-nominated Directors. In the US, the fiduciary 
duties for the scheme are allocated between committees which are staffed by senior employees of the Group; the investment 
committee has the primary responsibility for the investment and management of plan assets. The funding of the Group’s major 
schemes reflects the different rules within each jurisdiction. 

In the UK, the level of funding is determined by statutory triennial actuarial valuations in accordance with pensions legislation. 
Where the scheme falls below 100% funded status, the Group and the scheme trustees must agree on how the deficit is to be 
remedied. The UK Pensions Regulator has significant powers and sets out in codes and guidance the parameters for scheme 
funding. As a result of the 2021 triennial valuation, the Group’s final deficit funding contribution to the scheme during 2024 is £26m. 
RELX provides a guarantee in respect of scheme liabilities up to a maximum amount whereby debt is calculated under Section 75 
of the Pensions Act 1995. No liability has been recognised in respect of this guarantee as any possibility of triggering Section 75 is 
considered remote and RELX expect the scheme to continue operating with more than sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities as they 
fall due for the foreseeable future.  

The US scheme has an annual statutory valuation which forms the basis for establishing the employer contribution each year (subject 
to ERISA and IRS minimums). Should the statutory funded status fall to below 100%, the US Pension Protection Act requires the deficit 
to be rectified with additional contributions over a seven-year period. The US scheme’s funded status is in excess of 100%. 

Employer cash contributions to defined benefit pension schemes in respect of 2024 are expected to be approximately £35m 
including a £26m pension deficit funding contribution relating to the UK scheme recovery plan. 

The pension expense (excluding interest amounts) recognised in the income statement consists of: 

Defined benefit pension expense 
Defined contribution pension expense 
Total 

All of the pension expense is recognised within operating profit.

Net interest on net defined benefit pension scheme liabilities is presented within net finance costs in the income statement. The 
net defined benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31 December of the 
prior year.  

The significant valuation assumptions, determined for each major scheme in conjunction with the respective independent 
actuaries, are presented below.

Discount rates are set by reference to high-quality corporate bond yields of a currency and a term consistent with the Group’s 
pension schemes. High quality corporate bonds are those for which at least one of the main ratings agencies in a given region 
considers to be AA-rated (or equivalent). 

For the UK, future price inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI), has been derived with regard to the term of pension 
liabilities, the inflation implied by redemption yields on fixed interest and index-linked gilts and allowing for inflation risk premium. 
The price inflation assumptions allow for the expected impact of RPI reform, in particular expectations that future levels of RPI and 
CPI will be broadly aligned after 2030. For the US, inflation is based on the statutory limits on compensation and benefits. 

Mortality assumptions make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable 
mortality statistics. Future improvements for the 2023 year-end for the UK are in line with the CMI 2022 Core Projections Model, 
with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25 per cent p.a., and for the US are in line with the Mortality Improvements Scale MP-

As at 31 December 2023, the defined benefit obligations comprised £3,626m (2022: £3,569m) in relation to funded schemes and 
£180m (2022: £183m) in relation to unfunded schemes. 

The weighted average duration of defined benefit scheme liabilities is 14 years in the UK (2022: 15 years) and 9 years in the US  
(2022: 9 years). Net deferred tax assets of £16m (2022: £14m) are recognised in respect of the net pension balance. 

A net pension asset has been recognised in relation to the UK and US funded schemes after considering the guidance in IAS 19 – 
Employee Benefits and IFRIC 14. The UK funded scheme moved into a surplus position for the first time at the interim reporting 
date of 30 June 2022. The split between net pension obligations and net pension assets is as follows:

(1)  Assets are held in unquoted funds which invest in equities with quoted prices 
(2)  Within the UK scheme are asset backed securities totalling £247m (2022: £375m), other credit assets of £452m (2022: £199m), forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts of £4m (2022: £3m) and government bonds totalling £1,962m (2022: £1,721m) offset by interest rate swaps of £4m (2022: £115m) and 
short-term sale and repurchase agreements totalling £910m (2022; £1,284m) whereby the UK scheme funds the purchase of government bonds using 
existing bonds as security. In the US, the assets primarily relate to government bonds, corporate bonds and interest rate swaps. Of the gross assets, 
£2,169m (2022: £1,945m) are assets with quoted prices in active markets. 

(3)  Assets without quoted prices in active markets 
(4)  Includes £83m (2022: £220m) of assets with quoted prices in an active market. The remainder are held in funds which do not have quoted prices 

Assets and obligations associated with the schemes are sensitive to changes in the market values of assets and the market-
related assumptions used to value scheme liabilities. In particular, adverse changes to asset values, discount rates or inflation 
could increase future pension costs and funding requirements. 

Typically, the Group’s schemes are exposed to: investment risks, whereby actual rates of return on plan assets may be below those 
rates used to determine the defined benefit obligations; and interest rate risks, whereby scheme deficits may increase if bond 
yields in the UK and the US decline and are not offset by returns in liability matching and other assets. The schemes are also 
exposed to other risks, such as unanticipated future increases in member longevity patterns and inflation, all potentially leading to 
an increase in scheme liabilities. 

Investment policies of each scheme are intended to ensure continuous payment of defined benefit pensions in the short term and 
long term. Efforts are made to limit risks on marketable securities by adopting investment policies that diversify assets across 
geographies and among equities, liability matching assets, property funds, cash and other assets. Asset allocations are dependent 
on a variety of factors including the duration of scheme liabilities and the funded position of the plan. The primary UK scheme uses 
a liability driven investment (LDI) approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds so that the value of 
scheme assets change in the same way as the scheme’s liabilities and achieve a matching effect for the most significant plan 
liability assumptions of interest rates and inflation rates.

6 Pension schemes (continued) 

Sensitivity analysis 
The valuation of the Group’s pension scheme liabilities involves significant actuarial assumptions, being the life expectancy of the 
members, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted. Differences arising from actual experience 
or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges. In particular, changes in assumptions for discount 
rates, inflation and life expectancies that are reasonably possible would have the following approximate effects on the defined 
benefit pension obligations: 

Increase/decrease of 0.5% in discount rate 
Increase/decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate 
Increase/decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy 

£m

The above analysis has been calculated on the same basis used to determine the defined benefit obligation recognised in the 
statement of financial position. There has been no change in the methods used to prepare the analysis compared with prior years. 
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that 
changes in the above assumptions would occur in isolation as some of the assumptions may be correlated. 

7 Net finance costs

Losses of £2m (2022: gains of £2m; 2021: losses of £1m) on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges were recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedge reserve, and may be reclassified to the income statement in future periods. 
Losses of £1m (2022: £1m; 2021: nil) in total were transferred from the hedge reserve in the period. 

The interest charge on term debt includes a charge of £26m in respect of the early redemption of bonds that were due to be repaid in 
August 2027.  

8 Disposals and other non-operating items 

Accounting policy 
Assets of businesses that are available for immediate sale in their current condition and for which a sales process is 
considered highly probable to complete are classified as assets held for sale and are carried at the lower of carrying value and 
fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is based on anticipated disposal proceeds, typically derived from firm or indicative offers 
from potential acquirers. Non-current assets are not amortised or depreciated following their classification as held for sale. 
Liabilities of businesses held for sale are also separately classified on the statement of financial position.  

Fair value movements in the venture capital portfolio are reported within disposals and other items. See note 15 for further details.

9 Taxation 

Accounting policy 
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement 
except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, 
outside the income statement (either in other comprehensive income, directly in equity, or through a business combination), 
in which case the tax appears in the same statement as the transaction that gave rise to it. 

Current tax is the amount of corporate income taxes expected to be payable or recoverable based on the profit for the period 
as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible, and is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or 
substantively enacted at the date of the statement of financial position. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in 
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. Provisions are established 
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 

Current tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions when management expects that, upon examination 
of the uncertainty by a tax authority in possession of all relevant knowledge, it is more likely than not that an economic outflow 
will occur. Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these provisions are reassessed at the date of each statement of 
financial position, and the provisions are remeasured as required to reflect current information. 

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the statement of financial position. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences but not recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the reversal of the temporary difference 
can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised, and are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. The 
availability of suitable taxable profit is considered probable when an entity has taxable temporary differences (i.e. deferred tax 
liabilities) relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, that are expected to reverse in the same period 
as the deductible temporary difference or unused tax losses or credit. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of temporary differences that arise on initial recognition of 
assets and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination. Deferred tax is not discounted. 

When the acquisition of an asset qualifies to be accounted for as a business combination, deferred tax is generally required to 
be recognised on the difference between the tax base and the book base of the assets and liabilities acquired and assumed. 
The assets acquired often include identifiable intangible assets as well as goodwill. In many jurisdictions, the manner in which 
a business combination is effected will impact the tax deductibility and therefore the deferred tax recognised in relation to such 
intangibles and goodwill. 

In an ‘asset acquisition’, where the buyer acquires the trade and assets of a business, there is often a tax deduction available 
for the amortisation of the identifiable intangible assets and sometimes for the goodwill. In this situation, deferred tax is 
recognised on the difference between the tax base and the book base of the assets. 

In a ‘share acquisition’, where the buyer acquires the share capital of a legal entity that continues to own the trade and assets, 
tax deductions for amortisation are usually not available. Intangibles which do not qualify for tax deductions therefore give rise 
to a deferred tax liability. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary differences that arise from goodwill 
where that is not deductible for tax purposes. 

Other areas of accounting judgement 
In 2023 the valuation of provisions in relation to uncertain tax positions was no longer considered to be a key source of 
estimation uncertainty which could give rise to a risk of material adjustment in the next 12 months, given the overall level of 
risk is now significantly lower than in previous years. 

The Group is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions, giving rise to complex tax issues. As a multinational enterprise, our tax returns 
in the countries in which we operate are subject to tax authority audits as a matter of routine. While the Group is confident that tax 
returns are appropriately prepared and filed, amounts are provided in respect of uncertain tax positions that reflect the risk with 
respect to tax matters under active discussion with tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty. 

The valuation of provisions required in relation to uncertain tax positions involves estimation. Provisions against uncertain tax 
positions are measured using one of the following methods, depending on which of the methods management expects will 
better predict the amount it will pay over to the tax authority: 

■  The Single Best Estimate – where there is a single outcome that is more likely than not to occur. This will happen, for 

example, where the tax outcome is binary (such as whether an entity can deduct an item of expenditure) or the range of 
possible outcomes is narrow or concentrated on a single value. The most likely outcome may be that no tax is expected to 
be payable, in which case the provision is nil; or 

■  A Probability-Weighted Expected Value – where, on the balance of probabilities, something will be paid to the tax authority 
but the possible outcomes are widely dispersed with low individual probabilities (i.e. there is no single outcome more likely 
than not to occur). In this case, the provision is the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in the range.

9 Taxation (continued) 

In assessing provisions against uncertain tax positions, management uses in-house tax experts, professional firms and 
previous experience to inform the evaluation of risk. However, it remains possible that uncertainties will ultimately be resolved 
at amounts greater or smaller than the liabilities recorded. 

In particular, although we report cross-border transactions undertaken between Group subsidiaries on an arm’s-length basis 
in tax returns in accordance with OECD guidelines, transfer pricing relies on the exercise of judgement and it is frequently 
possible for there to be a range of legitimate and reasonable views. This means that it is impossible to be certain that the 
returns basis will be sustained on examination. Discussions with tax authorities relating to cross-border transactions and 
other matters are ongoing in a number of our major trading jurisdictions. Although the timing and amount of final resolution of 
these uncertain tax positions cannot be reliably predicted, no significant impact on the results of the Group is expected in the 
next year or foreseeable future. 

Estimation of income taxes also includes assessments of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, consistent with the Group’s 
forecasts and annual strategy plan used in the preparation of the annual report and accounts. Deferred tax assets are only 
recognised to the extent that they are considered recoverable based on existing tax laws and forecasts of future taxable profits 
against which the underlying tax deductions can be utilised. The recoverability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each 
reporting period, and changes in recognition of deferred tax assets will affect the tax liability in the period of that reassessment.

The UK current tax charge was £157m (2022: £102m; 2021: £46m). Cash tax paid (net) in the year was £619m (2022: £495m; 2021: 
£342m), which is different to the tax expense for the year set out above. 

There are a number of reasons why the cash tax payments in a particular year will be different from the tax expense in the accounts: 

■  Tax payments relating to a particular year’s profits are typically due partly in the year and partly in the following year. 
■  Tax expense includes deferred tax, an accounting adjustment where an item is included in the income statement in one year but 
is taxed in another year. The acquisition of intangible assets often results in deferred tax liabilities, the unwind of which does 
not result in tax payments. 

■  Current tax expense is the best estimate at the end of the period of cash tax expected to be paid. To the extent the final tax 

liability is different, any cash tax impact will occur in a later period. 

■  Some of the benefits of tax deductions related to share based payments, pensions and hedging are credited to equity or other 

comprehensive income rather than to tax expense. 

Set out below is a reconciliation of the difference between tax expense for the period and the theoretical expense calculated by 
multiplying accounting profit by the applicable tax rate. 

We believe the most meaningful applicable rate is that obtained by multiplying the accounting profits and losses of all consolidated 
entities by the applicable domestic rate in each of those entities’ jurisdictions. 

The net tax expense charged on profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average 
of tax rates applicable to accounting profits and losses of the consolidated entities, as follows:

9 Taxation (continued) 
The weighted average applicable tax rate for the year was 24.9% (2022: 23.6%; 2021: 23.3%), reflecting the applicable rates in the 
countries where the Group operates. The Group’s future tax charge will be sensitive to the geographic mix of profits and losses and 
the tax rates and laws in force in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. 

The BEPS Pillar Two Minimum Tax legislation was enacted in July 2023 in the UK with effect from 2024. The Group has applied the 
temporary exception under IAS 12 in relation to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the Pillar Two 
rules. The new rules are not expected to have a significant impact on the tax charge for the Group. 

In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in August 2022 introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax. This is not expected 
to have any significant impact on the Group. The Group will continue to monitor developments. 

In the UK, an increase in the corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% from April 2023 was enacted in 2021. In the Netherlands, an 
increase in the corporation tax rate from 25% to 25.8% from 2022 and changes to loss recognition rules were also enacted in 2021. 
In total, the deferred tax effect of changes in tax rates for the year was a tax credit of nil (2022: £3m; 2021: £8m) in the income statement. 

The effective tax rate of 22.1% (2022: 22.8%; 2021: 18.1%) was lower than the weighted average applicable rate of 24.9%. Income 
not taxable and expenses not deductible include a credit of £21m (2022: £13m; 2021: £15m) relating to research and development. 
In 2023 and 2021, there were tax credits arising from the substantial resolution of prior year tax matters. In 2021, the change in 
recognition and measurement of deferred tax includes the deferred tax effect of tax rate increases in the UK and the Netherlands 
of £8m and changes to loss recognition rules in the Netherlands of £15m. In 2021, there was a tax credit of £7m relating to the 
revaluation of a put and call option arrangement. 

The following tax has been recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity during the year: 

Tax on items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss 
Tax on actuarial movements on defined benefit pension schemes 

Tax on items that may be reclassified to profit or loss 
Tax on fair value movements on cash flow hedges 

Net tax (charge)/credit recognised in other comprehensive income

Current tax assets and liabilities are net amounts in countries where there is a legally enforceable right to offset assets and 
liabilities on a net basis. 

The Group maintained provisions for uncertain tax positions. The total carrying amount of these provisions of £173m (2022: £239m) 
is comprised of a number of individually immaterial amounts. It is not expected that any resolution of the matters to which the 
provisions relate, or changes in assumptions relating to the provisions, will have a material impact on the Group’s financial results 
in the next year.

The closing deferred tax liability balance of other temporary differences includes those relating to capitalised development 
costs of £120m (2022: £165m) and pension surplus of £30m (2022: £32m). The closing deferred tax asset balance of other 
temporary differences includes those relating to accruals and provisions of £128m (2022: £118m), share based remuneration 
provisions of £59m (2022: £41m) and intercompany interest of £21m (2022: £14m). 

As a result of exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and capital gains on disposal there are no significant taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint arrangements. 

While a number of entities in Exhibitions suffered losses due to the impact of Covid-19 over the last few years, in no individual 
country were they material. Following the return to profitability in the Exhibitions business, the remaining trading losses were 
substantially utilised this year. Other deferred tax assets have been recognised including for losses in the US and Netherlands, 
the majority of which are expected to have been utilised by 2029. 

Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses and other deductible temporary differences have only been recognised to the extent 
that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow the asset to be recovered.

10 Earnings per share 

Accounting policy 
Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by taking the reported net profit attributable to shareholders and dividing this by the 
total weighted average number of shares. 

The diluted figures are calculated after taking account of potential additional ordinary shares arising from share options and 
conditional shares. The dilutive impact is calculated as the weighted average of all potentially dilutive shares. 

Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted net profit attributable to RELX PLC shareholders by the total 
weighted average number of shares.

12 Acquisitions 

Accounting policy 
Goodwill, being the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, represents benefits which 
do not qualify for recognition as intangible assets, including: the ability of a business to generate higher returns than individual 
assets; skilled workforces; and acquisition synergies that are specific to the Group. In addition, goodwill arises on the 
recognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions. 

During the year, a number of acquisitions were made. The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value 
to the Group. The fair values of the consideration given and of the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below.

During 2023, RELX completed several acquisitions for total consideration of £130m (2022: £443m), or £126m (2022: £437m) 
adjusted for cash acquired. In 2022, this included the acquisition of investments in joint ventures and associates of £61m. Refer to 
note 15 for further details. Total cash spent on acquisitions was £124m (2022: £394m), excluding nil borrowings (2022: £3m of 
borrowings) in acquired businesses and including deferred consideration of £16m (2022: £21m) on past acquisitions. 

The businesses acquired in 2023 contributed £15m to revenue, decreased adjusted operating profit by £3m, decreased net profit by 
£20m (after charging £17m of integration costs and amortisation of acquired intangibles) and decreased net cash inflow from 
operating activities by £7m for the part year under the Group’s ownership and before taking account of acquisition financing costs. 
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a pro forma basis the Group revenues, adjusted operating profit 
and net profit attributable to RELX PLC shareholders for the year would have been £9,168m, £3,026m and £1,777m respectively, 
before taking account of acquisition financing costs.

Ordinary dividends declared and paid in the year ended 31 December 2023, in amounts per ordinary share, comprise: a final 
dividend for 2022 of 38.9p (2022: final dividend for 2021 of 35.5p; 2021: final dividend for 2020 of 33.4p) and a 2023 interim dividend 
for 2023 of 17.0p (2022: 15.7p; 2021: 14.3p), giving a total of 55.9p (2022: 51.2p; 2021: 47.7p). 

The Directors of RELX PLC have proposed a final dividend for 2023 of 41.8p per ordinary share (2022: 38.9p; 2021: 35.5p), giving a 
total for the financial year of 58.8p per ordinary share (2022: 54.6p; 2021: 49.8p). The total cost of funding the proposed final 
dividend is expected to be £786m, for which no liability has been recognised at the statement of financial position date. 

The Employee Benefit Trust has currently waived the right to receive dividends on RELX PLC shares. This waiver has been applied 
to dividends paid in 2021, 2022 and 2023.

14 Intangible assets 

Accounting policy 
On acquisition of a subsidiary or business, the purchase consideration is allocated between the net tangible and intangible 
assets other than goodwill on a fair value basis, with any excess purchase consideration representing goodwill. Goodwill is 
carried at fair value as at the date of acquisition less impairment charges. Acquired intangible assets are carried at their fair 
value as at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation (including impairment). On disposal of a subsidiary or business, 
the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss recognised in the income statement. 

Management judgement is required to identify intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations which comprise: 
market-related assets (e.g. trademarks, imprints, brands); customer-related assets (e.g. subscription bases, customer lists, 
customer relationships); editorial content; software and systems (e.g. application infrastructure, product delivery platforms, 
in-process research and development); and other intangible assets mainly comprising contract and rights-related assets.  

The valuation of acquired intangible assets represents the estimated economic value in use, using standard valuation 
methodologies, including as appropriate, discounted cash flow and comparable market transactions. Judgements involved in 
estimating valuation of the intangible assets include growth in cash flows over the forecast period, the long-term growth rate 
assumed thereafter and the discount rate applied to the forecast cash flows.  

The selection of appropriate amortisation periods for acquired intangible assets requires management to assess the longevity 
of brands and imprints, the strength and stability of customer relationships, the market positions of the acquired intangible 
assets and the technological and competitive risks that they face. Certain intangible assets are in relation to acquired science 
and medical publishing businesses that have been determined to have indefinite lives. The longevity of these assets is 
evidenced by their long- established and well regarded journal titles, and their characteristically stable market positions. 
Intangible assets, other than journal titles determined to have indefinite lives, are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets with finite lives are: 

■  Market-related assets – 1 to 40 years 
■  Customer-related assets – 1 to 20 years 
■  Editorial content – 1 to 40 years 
■  Software and systems – 1 to 10 years 
■  Other – 3 to 20 years 

Journal titles determined to have indefinite lives are not amortised and are subject to impairment review at least annually, 
including a review of events and circumstances to ensure that they continue to support an indefinite useful life. 

Internally developed intangible assets (development spend) typically comprise software and systems development where an 
identifiable asset is created that is probable to generate future economic benefits and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Internally developed intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives  
of three to 10 years. Impairment reviews are carried out at least annually or where indicators of impairment are identified. 

Impairment reviews 
Goodwill and acquired intangible assets with an indefinite life are allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) and tested for 
impairment at least annually or when there is an indicator that the asset may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised in 
the income statement in administration and other expenses to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its recoverable 
amount and not subsequently reversed. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
The carrying amounts of all other intangible assets are reviewed where there are indications of possible impairment. 

An impairment review involves a comparison of the carrying value of the asset with estimated values in use based on the  
latest management cash flow projections, approved by the Board. Key areas of judgement in estimating the values in use  
of businesses are the growth in cash flows over a forecast period of up to five years, the long-term growth rate assumed 
thereafter and the discount rate applied to the forecast cash flows. These calculations require the use of estimates in respect 
of forecast cash flows and discount rates. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, value in use estimates are made based on the cash flows of the CGU to which the asset belongs. 

Critical judgement 
Development spend 
Development spend encompasses investment in new products and other initiatives, ranging from the building of online delivery 
platforms, to launch costs of new services, to building new infrastructure and applications. Launch costs and other ongoing 
operating expenses of new products and services are expensed as incurred. The costs of building product applications, 
platforms and infrastructure are capitalised as internally generated intangible assets, where the investment they represent 
has demonstrable value and the technical and commercial feasibility is assured. Costs eligible for capitalisation must be 
incremental, clearly identified and directly attributable to a particular project. The resulting assets are amortised over their 
estimated useful lives. Judgement is required in the assessment of the potential value of a development project, the identification 
of costs eligible for capitalisation and the selection of appropriate asset lives. In the impairment reviews carried out at least 
annually or where indicators of impairment are identified, estimates relating to the future cash flows and discount rates used 
in calculating the value in use of the intangible asset may have a material effect on the reported amounts of intangible assets.

The carrying amount of goodwill is shown after cumulative amortisation of £1,199m (2022: £1,253m), which was charged prior to 
the adoption of IFRS, and £9m (2022: £9m) of subsequent impairment charges recorded in prior years. 

The Legal business area has £636m (2022: £735m) of capitalised development costs associated with platforms and infrastructure, 
with a remaining amortisation period of up to ten years. 

Included in market-related intangible assets are £119m (2022: £125m) of journal titles relating to Scientific, Technical & Medical 
determined to have indefinite lives based on an assessment of their historical longevity and stable market positions. 

Impairment review 
There were no charges for impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets in 2023 (2022: nil) identified during the 
annual impairment review. 

Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are compiled and assessed among groups of CGUs, which represent the lowest level 
at which goodwill is monitored by management. Typically, acquisitions are integrated into existing business areas, and the goodwill 
arising is allocated to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. As the business areas 
have become increasingly integrated and globalised, the current CGU allocation reflects the global leverage of assets, skills, 
knowledge and technology platforms, and the monitoring of goodwill by management.

The pre–tax discount rates used are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect a risk premium 
specific to each business. A post-tax discount rate was applied to post-tax cash flows. The equivalent pre-tax discount rate has 
been estimated by grossing up the post-tax rate. The Group’s weighted average cost of capital is derived from a risk free rate, a 
market risk premium, a risk adjustment (beta) and a cost of debt adjustment. The discount rates and the cash flow projections are 
in nominal terms and therefore, take into account the impact of inflation. The Group’s weighted average cost of capital was calculated 
as at 30 September 2023 when the impairment review was performed, and there were no indicators of impairment in the intervening 
period to 31 December 2023.  

The key assumptions within the forecast growth in the cash flows over a forecast period of up to five years are revenue growth, 
operating margin and cash conversion. Revenue growth and operating profit margin forecasts for each CGU are derived from past 
results adjusted by management based on salient current and future considerations. Cash conversion rates for each CGU are 
based on historical cash conversion rates. Nominal long-term market growth rates, which are applied after the forecast period  
of up to five years, are broadly in line with the long-term average growth prospects for the sectors and territories in which the 
businesses operate.  

A sensitivity analysis has been performed based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by 
management: an increase in the discount rate of 1.5%; a decrease in the compound annual growth rate for cash flow in the five-
year forecast period of 2%; a decrease in the nominal long-term market growth rates of 1%; and a combined increase in discount 
rate of 1% and a decrease in the nominal long-term market growth rates of 1%. These sensitivity analyses show that no 
impairment charges would result from these scenarios.  

15 Investments 

Accounting policy 
Investments, other than investments in joint arrangements and associates, are stated in the statement of financial position at 
fair value. Changes in the fair value of investments held as part of the venture capital portfolio are reported in disposals and 
other non-operating items in the income statement. All items recognised in the income statement relating to investments, 
other than investments in joint arrangements and associates, are reported as disposals and other non-operating items. 

Venture capital investments represent interests in listed and unlisted securities. The fair value of listed securities is based on 
quoted prices in active markets. The fair value of unlisted securities is based on management’s estimate of fair value based on 
standard valuation techniques, including market comparisons and discounts of future cash flows, having regard to maximising 
the use of observable inputs and adjusting for risk. Advice from valuation experts is used as appropriate. Refer to note 17 for 
further information. 

All joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures because the Group shares joint control and has rights to the net assets 
of the arrangements. Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method and stated in the 
statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets, less any 
impairment in value.

17 Financial instruments 

Accounting policy 
Financial instruments comprise investments (other than investments in joint ventures or associates), trade receivables,  
cash and cash equivalents, payables and accruals, borrowings and derivative financial instruments. 

Investments (other than investments in joint ventures and associates) are described in note 15. The fair value of such 
investments is based on standard valuation techniques, including market comparisons and discounts of future cash flows, 
having regard to maximising the use of observable inputs and adjusting for risk. (These investments are typically classified as 
either Level 1 or 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.) 

Trade receivables are carried in the statement of financial position at invoiced value less allowance for expected credit losses. 
Expected credit losses are based on the ageing of trade receivables, experience and circumstance. Borrowings and payables 
are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost (other than fixed rate borrowings in designated 
hedging relationships for which the carrying amount of the hedged portion of the borrowings is subsequently adjusted for the 
gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk). 

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Where an effective hedge is in 
place against changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings, the hedged borrowings are adjusted for changes in fair value 
attributable to the risk being hedged with a corresponding income or expense included in the income statement within finance 
costs. The offsetting gains or losses from remeasuring the fair value of the related derivatives are also recognised in the 
income statement within finance costs. When the related derivative expires, is sold or terminated, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged borrowing is amortised in the income statement over the 
period to maturity of the borrowing using the effective interest method. 

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows 
are recognised (net of tax) in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedge reserve. The fair value amounts 
relating to foreign currency basis spreads are recorded in a separate component of equity in the cost of hedging reserve.  
If a hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then,  
at the time that the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been 
recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that  
do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in the hedge reserve are recognised in the income 
statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of hedges is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 

Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other 
comprehensive income is either retained in the hedge reserve until the firm commitment or forecasted transaction occurs, or, 
where a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, is immediately credited or expensed in the income statement. 

Derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the statement of financial 
position at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. 

The fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the replacement costs calculated using observable market rates 
of interest and exchange. The fair value of long-term borrowings is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at 
observable market rates. (These instruments are accordingly classified as Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.) 

The main financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk, market risk – comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange 
risk – and credit risk. Financial instruments are used to finance the Group’s businesses and to manage interest rate and foreign 
exchange risks. The Group’s businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions. Details of financial instruments 
subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.

subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.

Liquidity risk 
The Group maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements at competitive rates. 

The balance of long-term debt, short-term debt and committed bank facilities is managed to provide security of funding, taking into 
account the cash generation cycle of the business and the uncertain size and timing of acquisition spend. To accommodate the 
significant free cash flow generated by the Group and to capitalise on an inexpensive source of funding, a meaningful portion of the 
overall debt portfolio is typically kept short term as long as there exists acceptable liquidity in the commercial paper markets and 
sufficient capacity under committed credit lines. The Group’s treasury policies ensure adequate liquidity by requiring that (a) no 
more than $2bn of term debt matures in any 12-month period, (b) the sum of term debt maturing over the ensuing 12 months plus 
short-term borrowings is less than the sum of available cash plus committed facilities and (c) minimum levels of borrowing with 
maturities over three and five years are maintained. 

The treasury policies ensure debt efficiency by (a) targeting certain levels of short-term borrowings across a given year, 
(b) maintaining a weighted average maturity of the gross debt portfolio of approximately five years and (c) minimising surplus cash 
balances. From time to time, based on cash flow and market conditions, the Group may redeem term debt early or repurchase 
outstanding debt in the open market. 

Debt is issued to meet the funding requirements of various jurisdictions and in the currencies that are needed. It is recognised  
that debt can act as a natural translation hedge of earnings, net assets and net cash flow in currencies other than the reporting 
currency. For this reason, the majority of the Group’s net debt is denominated in US dollars and euros, reflecting the Group’s 
largest geographical markets. There were no changes to the Group’s long-term approach to capital and liquidity management 
during the year. The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table 
below. The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash flows and includes contractual gross cash flows to be exchanged 
as part of cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set-off.

The carrying amount of derivative financial liabilities comprises £130m (2022: £215m) in relation to fair value hedges, £14m (2022: 
£32m) in relation to cash flow hedges and £3m (2022: £22m) not designated as hedging instruments, totalling £147m (2022: 
£269m), of which £16m (2022: £33m) have been classified as current and £131m (2022: £236m) as non-current liabilities in the 
statement of financial position. The carrying amount of derivative financial assets comprises £19m (2022: nil) in relation to fair 
value hedges, £53m (2022: £24m) in relation to cash flow hedges and £9m (2022: £8m) not designated as hedging instruments, 
totalling £81m (2022: £32m), of which £34m (2022: £21m) have been classified as current and £47m (2022: £11m) as non-current 
assets in the statement of financial position. 

The Group has ample liquidity and access to debt capital markets, providing the ability to repay or refinance borrowings as they 
mature and to fund ongoing requirements. At 31 December 2023, the Group had access to a $3.0bn committed bank facility maturing 
in April 2026, which was undrawn. This facility backs up short-term borrowings, and has pricing linked to three ESG performance 
targets, all of which were achieved in 2023. All borrowings that mature within the next two years can be covered by the facility and by 
utilising available cash resources. The committed bank facility is not subject to a financial covenant and there are no financial 
covenants in any outstanding public bonds. 

Market risk 
The Group’s primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements. Derivatives are used to manage the 
risks associated with interest rate and exchange rate movements and the Group does not enter into speculative derivatives. Where 
the impact of derivatives on the income statement and the statement of financial position could be significant, hedge accounting is 
applied (subject to satisfying the required criteria) as described in ‘Hedge accounting’ below. Derivatives used by the Group for 
hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources. The Group is also exposed to 
changes in the market value of its venture capital investments as described in note 15. The impact of market risks on net post-
employment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis. 

Interest rate exposure management 
The Group’s interest rate exposure management policy aims to minimise interest costs with an acceptable level of year-on-year 
volatility. To achieve this, the Group uses fixed rate term debt and interest rate swaps to give a target mix of fixed rate and floating 
rate borrowings. Interest rate derivatives are used only to hedge an underlying risk and no net market positions are held. 

At 31 December 2023, including the effect of interest rate swaps, 57% of gross bank and bond borrowings were at fixed rates.  
A 100 basis point reduction in short-term interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in annual net finance costs of £26m 
(2022: £25m), based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial 
paper borrowings at 31 December 2023. A 100 basis point rise in short-term interest rates would result in an estimated increase 
in net finance costs of £26m (2022: £25m). 

The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2023 is restricted to the change in carrying 
value of floating rate to fixed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash flow hedge relationship and undesignated interest 
rate derivatives. A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net equity of nil (2022: nil) 
and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase net equity by an estimated amount of nil (2022: nil). The impact of a 
change in interest rates on the carrying value of fixed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset 
by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative. Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging 
relationship are carried at amortised cost.

relationship are carried at amortised cost. 

17 Financial instruments (continued) 
The Group has assessed the ongoing impact of the Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) reform and there has been no significant impact 
on the financial statements. The Group is primarily exposed to IBOR through its derivatives which swap fixed rate bond issuances 
to a floating rate of interest and which are designated in fair value hedge relationships. The table on page 198 details these interest 
rate derivatives which, at the year end, swap £1,112m of bonds with weighted average maturity of 4.0 years to a floating rate of 
interest previously referencing US dollar LIBOR (3 months) and swap £1,083m of bonds with weighted average maturity of 4.6 years 
to a floating rate of interest referencing Euribor (3 months). The Group has adopted the ISDA fallback protocol in respect of these 
derivatives and the fair value hedge designations are expected to remain highly effective throughout the transition to alternative 
risk free rates. The interest rate derivatives which referenced US dollar LIBOR have been transitioned to US dollar SOFR since 
30 June 2023 with the floating rates shown in the table on page 198 updated accordingly. 

Foreign currency exposure management 
Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of individual businesses whose operational currencies are other than 
sterling. Some of these exposures are offset by denominating borrowings in US dollars, euros and other currencies. Currency 
exposures on transactions denominated in a foreign currency are generally hedged using forward contracts. In addition, recurring 
transactions and future investment exposures may be hedged, in advance of becoming contractual. The precise policy differs 
according to the specific circumstances of the individual businesses. Highly predictable future cash flows may be covered for 
transactions expected to occur during the next 24 months (50 months for the Scientific, Technical & Medical subscription 
businesses) within limits defined according to the period before the transaction is expected to become contractual. Cover takes the 
form of foreign exchange forward contracts. Further information is provided in ‘Cash flow hedges’ below. 

A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2023 would decrease the carrying value of net 
assets, excluding net borrowings, by £835m (2022: £892m). This would be offset to a degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 
£716m (2022: £671m). A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2023 would increase the carrying 
value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by £835m (2022: £892m) and increase net borrowings by £716m (2022: £671m). 

A retranslation of the Group’s net profit for the year, assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but 
excluding transactional exposures, would reduce net profit by £145m (2022: £126m). A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies 
against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by £145m (2022: £126m). 

Credit risk 
The Group seeks to manage interest rate risk and limit foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments 
and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which 
are unsecured. The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount 
being hedged. The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents. 
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and 
investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them. 

The Group has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow 
significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than A-/A3 by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. 
At 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents totalled £155m (2022: £334m), of which 91% (2022: 96%) was held with banks rated 
A-/A3 or better. 

The Group also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers, which include national and state 
governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including insurance companies, law firms and life science 
companies. The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base. Trade 
receivable exposures are managed locally in the business areas where they arise. Where appropriate, business areas seek to 
minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms. Expected credit losses are based 
on management’s assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, 
recorded in the statement of financial position. 

Included within trade receivables are the following amounts which are past due, after considering loss allowance: 

Up to one month 
2 to 3 months 
4 to 6 months

Hedge accounting 
The hedging relationships that are designated under IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments are described below. 

Fair value hedges 
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the 
fair value of fixed rate borrowings due to interest rate and foreign currency movements which could affect the income statement. 
The table below details the designated fair value hedge relationships that were in place at 31 December 2023, swapping fixed rate 
term debt issues denominated in US dollars (USD) and euros to floating rate USD and euro debt respectively for the whole or part 
of their term, together with the related fixed and floating rates.

All fair value hedges were highly effective throughout the three years ended 31 December 2023. 

$200m of bonds that were due to be repaid in August 2027 were redeemed early in December 2023. These bonds had been 
swapped to floating rate in a fair value hedge relationship as described above, and on the early redemption the fair value 
adjustment to the bonds of £16m was expensed in full to the income statement as part of finance costs. The related derivatives 
were closed out with a cash outflow of £16m. Gross borrowings as at 31 December 2023 included £1m (2022: £10m) in relation to 
fair value adjustments to borrowings previously designated in a fair value hedge relationship which were de-designated in 2008. 
The related derivatives were closed out on de-designation with a cash inflow of £62m. £9m (2022: £3m) of these fair value 
adjustments were amortised in the year as a reduction to finance costs, including £6m in relation to the early redemption of the 
2027 bonds. 

Cash flow hedges 
As part of the Group’s interest rate exposure management, it has entered into certain cross-currency interest rate derivatives, 
individual components of which have been accounted for as cash flow hedges (with the remaining components accounted for as 
fair value hedges, as described above). These comprised interest rate derivatives which swapped a fixed rate €600m bond, issued 
in May 2015 and maturing in May 2025, to floating rate USD debt for the whole of its term. The component relating to the swap of 
the euro credit margin to USD is being accounted for as a cash flow hedge under IFRS 9, with the amount associated with foreign 
currency basis spreads recorded in the cost of hedging reserve. 

As part of the Group’s foreign currency exposure management, it has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts which fix 
the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the businesses for up to 50 months. 
These have been accounted for as cash flow hedges under IFRS 9 of the forecast foreign currency revenues, with gains and losses 
on the forward contracts deferred in the hedge reserve until the related revenue is recognised, at which time the accumulated 
gains and losses are reclassified to the income statement.

All cash flow hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2023. 

A deferred tax debit of £9m (2022: credit of £3m) in respect of the above gains and losses at 31 December 2023 was also deferred 
in the hedge reserve. 

Of the amounts recognised in the income statement in the year, losses of £17m (2022: gains of £18m) were recognised in revenue, 
and losses of £1m (2022: £1m) were recognised in finance costs. A tax credit of £4m (2022: debit of £4m) was recognised in relation 
to these items. 

The deferred gains and losses on foreign currency cash flow hedges at 31 December 2023 are currently expected to be recognised 
in the income statement in future years as shown in the table below, together with the principal amount of hedges relating to 
each year and their total carrying values included within derivative assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position:

The cash flows for these hedges are expected to occur in line with the recognition of the gains and losses in the income statement, 
or in the preceding year. These cash flows are included in the table on page 196. 

18 Inventories and pre-publication costs 

Accounting policy 
Inventories and pre-publication costs are stated at the lower of cost, including appropriate attributable overhead, and 
estimated net realisable value. Such costs typically comprise direct internal labour costs and externally commissioned 
editorial and other fees. 

Pre-publication costs, representing costs incurred in the origination of content prior to publication, are expensed systematically 
reflecting the expected sales profile over the estimated economic lives of the related products, generally up to five years. 

Annual reviews are carried out to assess the recoverability of carrying amounts.

19 Trade and other receivables 

Accounting policy 

Trade receivables are stated net of a loss allowance for expected credit losses. 

Trade receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing and their carrying amounts approximate to their fair value. 

The movements in the loss allowance during the year were as follows:

Prepayments and accrued income 

Current tax receivable 

Net finance lease receivable

Accounting policy 

Deferred income is recognised when either a customer has paid consideration, or RELX has an unconditional right to an 

amount of consideration, in advance of the goods and services being delivered. 

Trade payables, accruals and other payables are predominantly non-interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal values. 

Trade and other payables are predominantly non-interest bearing and their carrying amounts approximate to their fair value.  

Materially all of the opening deferred income balance has been recognised in the reporting period. 

Borrowings are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost, other than fixed rate borrowings in 

designated hedging relationships for which the carrying amount of the hedged portion of the borrowings is subsequently 

adjusted for the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk. When the related derivative in such a hedging relationship expires, 

is sold or terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged borrowing 

is amortised in the income statement over the period to maturity of the borrowing using the effective interest method.

22 Lease arrangements 

Accounting policy 
All leases where RELX is the lessee (with the exception of short-term and low-value leases) are recognised in the statement of 
financial position. A lease liability is recognised based on the present value of the future lease payments, and a corresponding 
right-of-use asset is recognised. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of 
the asset. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the lease liability. 

Low-value items and short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognised on the balance 
sheet and payments made in relation to these leases are recognised on a straight-line basis in the income statement. 

The leases held by the Group can be split into two categories: property and non-property. The Group leases various properties, 
principally offices, which have varying terms and renewal rights that are typical to the territory in which they are located. 

Non-property includes all other leases, such as cars and printers.

Interest expense on the lease liabilities recognised within finance costs was £6m (2022: £6m; 2021: £8m). 

As at 31 December 2023, RELX was committed to leases with future cash outflows totalling £6m (31 December 2022: £32m) which 
had not yet commenced and as such are not accounted for as a liability as at 31 December 2023. A liability and corresponding 
right-of-use asset will be recognised for these leases at the lease commencement date. 

RELX subleases vacant space available within its leased properties. IFRS 16 specifies conditions whereby a sublease is classed as 
a finance lease for the sub-lessor. The finance lease receivable balance held is as follows:

The closing balance of other reserves in the consolidated statement of changes in equity of £1,788m (2022: £1,717m) is comprised 
of the hedge reserve (£27m; 2022: £(8)m) and other reserves (£1,761m; 2022: £1,725m). 

Other reserves principally comprise retained earnings and the share based remuneration reserve. Movements in reserves during 
the period includes the effects of profits generated during the period, share repurchases, changes in exchange rates and other 
items. Dividends paid during 2023 were £1,059m (2022: £983m). Refer to note 13 for further details. 

31m (2022: 52m) RELX PLC ordinary shares held in treasury were cancelled resulting in a transfer of £673m between other 
reserves and shares held in treasury.   

The decrease of £285m in the translation reserve is due to the net effect of changes in exchange rates during the period which 
decreased net debt by £184m and assets (net of other liabilities) by £469m.

ahead of Company meetings and update their personal contact 
details. Shareview Dealing provides a share purchase and sale 
facility. Equiniti’s contact details are shown on page 234.

How to avoid share fraud and boiler room scams 
The FCA has issued some guidance on how to recognise and avoid 
investment fraud:

	§ Legitimate firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact 

you unexpectedly with an offer to buy or sell shares
	§ If you receive an unsolicited phone call, do not get into a 
conversation, note the name of the person and firm 
contacting you and then end the call

	§ Check the Financial Services Register available at 

 register.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting 

you is authorised by the FCA. If you wish to call the person or 
firm back, only use the contact details listed on the Register
	§ Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have any 

contact details on the Register, or if you are told that they are 
out of date

	§ Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at  

 www.fca.org.uk/consumers/unauthorised-firms-

individuals#list

	§ If you do buy or sell shares through an unauthorised firm,  

you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service 
or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme

	§ Consider obtaining independent financial and professional 
advice before you hand over any money. If it sounds too good  
to be true, it probably is

How to report a scam 
If you are approached by fraudsters, please tell the FCA using 
the share fraud reporting form at 
consumers/report-scam-unauthorised-firm, where you  
can find out more about investment scams. You can also call  
the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.

 www.fca.org.uk/

If you have already paid money to share fraudsters, you should 
contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or use its online tool: 

 www.actionfraud.police.uk/report_fraud

Share dealing service 
A telephone and internet dealing service is available through 
Equiniti, which provides a simple way for UK resident shareholders 
to buy or sell their shares. For telephone dealing call +44 (0)345 
603 7037 between 8.30am and 5.30pm (UK time), Monday to Friday 
(excluding public holidays in England and Wales), and for  
internet dealing log on to 
 www.shareview.co.uk/dealing. 
You will need your shareholder reference number as shown on 
your dividend confirmation.

ShareGift 
The Orr Mackintosh Foundation operates a scheme for 
shareholders with small shareholdings, that may be too small  
to sell economically, to make donations of shares. Details of  
the scheme can be obtained from the ShareGift website at 
 www.sharegift.org, or by telephoning ShareGift  

on +44 (0)20 7930 3737.

Sub-division of ordinary shares and share consolidation 
On 28 July 1986, each RELX PLC ordinary share of £1 nominal 
value was sub-divided into four ordinary shares of 25p each.  
On 2 May 1997, each 25p ordinary share was sub-divided into two 
ordinary shares of 12.5p each. On 7 January 2008, the ordinary 
shares of 12.5p each were consolidated on the basis of 58 new 
ordinary shares of 1451⁄116p nominal value for every 67 ordinary 
shares of 12.5p each held.

Capital gains tax 
The mid-market price of RELX PLC’s £1 ordinary shares on 
31 March 1982 was 282p. Adjusting for the sub-divisions and 
share consolidation referred to above results in an equivalent 
mid-market price of 40.72p for each existing ordinary share of 
1451⁄116p nominal value.

Warning to shareholders – unsolicited 
investment advice
	§ From time to time shareholders may receive unsolicited calls 

from fraudsters

	§ Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure 
investors into scams, sometimes known as boiler room scams

	§ They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or 
non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for 
an upfront payment

	§ While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this 

way you will probably lose your money

	§ Thousands of people contact the Financial Conduct Authority 

(FCA) about investment fraud each year
