RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Chair’s introduction to corporate governance

Stakeholder engagement and Board decision-making
The views and interests of RELX’s stakeholders are a key element 
of the Board’s decision-making process. We are focussed on 
ensuring that the interests of our stakeholders are duly taken into 
account during Board discussions. Across RELX we engage with 
our stakeholders throughout the year and we rely on this 
engagement to ensure we continue to provide solutions and 
services that meet the evolving needs of our customers and 
continue to effectively support our workforce. 

This is why we actively listen to our investors, employees, 
customers, suppliers and the communities that we serve and in 
which we operate, and we have appropriate mechanisms in place 
to ensure that the outcomes of such engagement are available to 
the Board. Information about our approach to stakeholder 
engagement is on pages 119 to 122.

Regulatory developments
During 2023, the UK Government and other regulatory bodies 
have considered several potential governance reforms. These 
proposals have evolved over the course of the year and we still 
await their finalisation. To ensure the Board is kept apprised of 
developments in this regard, we established a management 
steering committee, reporting to the Audit Committee, tasked 
with assessing the Company’s preparedness to respond to and 
implement any UK regulatory changes should they be adopted. 
The Audit Committee has also attended technical briefings with 
our external advisers on the scope and likely impact of the 
proposed reforms on RELX.

The Board has engaged with management in respect of further 
regulatory changes in the areas of sustainability and ESG 
reporting, which will impact RELX over the coming years. We have 
robust governance processes in place in respect of ESG matters 
and continue to monitor developments in this area, including in 
relation to the European Union Sustainability Reporting 
Standards and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.

Board effectiveness
As Chair, I am responsible for ensuring that the Board operates 
effectively, and that the Board, its Committees and each individual 
Director is evaluated on an annual basis. In 2023, we engaged 
Manchester Square Partners to conduct an externally facilitated 
evaluation.

The outcome of the evaluation confirmed that all of our Directors 
contribute effectively and continue to demonstrate commitment 
to their roles, and that the Board and its Committees continue to 
operate effectively. The evaluation process and its outcomes are 
explained on page 123.

Paul Walker
Chair

14 February 2024

Effective governance policies and 
practices are fundamental to 
RELX’s culture of acting with integrity 
in all that we do.

Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to introduce our Corporate 
Governance Review for the year ended 31 December 2023. The 
following pages provide an overview of our corporate governance 
framework and of the work undertaken by the Board and its 
Committees during the year. 

Together with the reports of the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees, our corporate governance review 
sets out our approach to effective governance and demonstrates 
how we have complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Corporate governance
The Board takes seriously its responsibility for overseeing the 
governance of RELX. We believe that effective governance policies 
and practices are fundamental to RELX’s culture of acting with 
integrity in all that we do and support the Company’s purpose to 
benefit society through its unique contributions (as set out on  
page 45 to 49). 

The Board believes pursuing the highest levels of corporate 
responsibility and delivering excellent financial performance 
should be pursued in tandem, and that doing so will result in 
long-term sustainable shareholder value creation. It also 
provides confidence to our stakeholders that the governance of 
RELX is appropriate for its size and profile as a listed company, 
helps to manage our risks and opportunities, ensures that our key 
stakeholders are appropriately considered in the decisions that 
we make, and maintains our corporate reputation.

Board changes and succession planning
There have been a number of changes to the composition of our 
Board and Committees during the year. Dr Wolfhart Hauser 
retired following the conclusion of our annual general meeting in 
April after serving as a Director since 2013. We thank Dr Hauser 
for his valued contributions to the Board and to the various 
Committees on which he served over the years. Suzanne Wood 
succeeded Dr Hauser as our Senior Independent Director,  
and Robert MacLeod has taken on the role of Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee.

We are pleased to have welcomed Alistair Cox to the Board this 
year. Following his appointment as a Non-Executive Director  
in April, Mr Cox has also joined our Audit, Remuneration and 
Corporate Governance Committees. In December 2023 the 
Company announced that Bianca Tetteroo will be joining the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director, with effect from 1 July 2024, 
subject to her election by shareholders at our AGM in April 2024. 
We look forward to welcoming her to the Board. Further 
information about our Board appointment process is available  
in our Nominations Committee Report on page 127.

The 2024 AGM will mark the retirement of Marike van Lier Lels 
from the Board. Marike joined the RELX PLC Board in 2015.  
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Ms van Lier Lels for  
her valued contributions to RELX.

Corporate governance review

Our governance framework

Board leadership
The Board is responsible for promoting the long-term sustainable success of the Company. To ensure the Board operates 
effectively and efficiently it has established four principal Committees to provide focused oversight, each with delegated authority 
to oversee and report to the Board on material and relevant matters, as appropriate.

The roles and responsibilities of each Committee are set out in their individual terms of reference which are available on the 
Company’s website 

 www.relx.com. A summary of the Committees’ key responsibilities is set out below.

The Board
The Board determines RELX’s purpose and values and sets and oversees delivery of its strategic aims  
and objectives for long-term, sustainable success. The Board monitors and oversees RELX’s governance, risk management  
and internal controls processes and culture.

Audit Committee
Reviews and monitors the 
integrity of financial reporting, 
internal control and risk 
management systems, the 
effectiveness of the internal 
audit process and the 
performance, independence 
and effectiveness of the 
external auditor. 

The Committee comprises only 
independent Non-Executive 
Directors.

Remuneration Committee
Determines, monitors and 
oversees the implementation of 
RELX’s remuneration policy for 
the CEO, CFO, the Chair, and 
Senior Executives below Board 
level. The Committee reviews 
the ongoing appropriateness of 
the remuneration policy. 

The Committee comprises only 
the Chair and Non-Executive 
Directors.

Committees. 

The Committee comprises only 
the Chair and Non-Executive

RELX Senior Executives
To enable efficient day-to-day management of RELX’s business areas, there is a structure of delegated authorities in place from 
the Board to the Chief Executive Officer and a team of Senior Executives (shown on pages 110 to 111). This delegated authority 
framework, which is reviewed and approved by the Board each year, allows the necessary operational and management decisions 
to be taken by the right people, at the appropriate time to execute the company’s strategy. There are appropriate controls in place to 
ensure such decisions remain consistent with the risk appetite, policies and objectives established by the Board.

Governance structure
RELX’s corporate governance framework consists of leadership 
bodies, processes and supporting documentation to ensure that 
RELX is appropriately directed, led and controlled at all levels, 
with appropriate oversight and involvement by the Board and 
senior management. It is designed to safeguard and enhance the 
creation of long-term, sustainable shareholder value and to 
enable our business areas to operate with the required agility and 
flexibility to address effectively the needs of our customers, while 
taking into account all applicable statutory and regulatory 
requirements. The rights, responsibilities and accountabilities of 
those who work for and on behalf of RELX are clearly established 
through delegated authorities, corporate policies and codes of 
ethics and conduct, which promote the protection of RELX’s 
reputation and our commitment to acting with integrity in all that 
we do. The RELX Operating and Governance Principles set out the 
processes, policies, controls and related assurance activities that 
have been put in place to mitigate risk and serve as a first point of 
reference for management. They also provide our workforce with 
the corporate policies and practices with which they must comply. 

The Principles are regularly reviewed by the Board and are 
updated as required. RELX’s Ethics Code sets out the core 
principles and standards of professional conduct by which RELX 
operates and provides a framework for building and maintaining 
the desired culture of RELX. The Ethics Code provides all those 
who work for RELX with clear guidelines for how to conduct 
themselves in the workplace and across our broader operating 
environments, to inspire trust among all our stakeholders and to 
demonstrate commitment to our core value of ‘Do the Right 
Thing’. There are mechanisms in place to help our workforce 
to understand and comply with their obligations under the 
Ethics Code, which include ongoing training and established 
communication channels to ask questions and report concerns. 
We endeavour to ensure that our workplace policies are 
user-friendly, clear and accessible. The Ethics Code is 
regularly reviewed and approved by the Board and is available  
at, 
 www.relx.com. Internal control and risk management 
arrangements are a central part of our governance framework. 
These are monitored by the Audit Committee and overseen by 
the Board (further information is on pages 124 and 149 to 152).

the Board (further information is on pages 124 and 149 to 152).

Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code

RELX PLC applies the principles and provisions of the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code), a copy of which is 
available on the FRC’s website, 

 www.frc.org.uk. 

For the year ended 31 December 2023, the Board considers 
that the company fully complied with the principles and 
provisions of the Code. 

Board programme

The Board met formally seven times during the year. Five 
meetings were held in person, in the UK and in New York. Through 
a structured programme of scheduled meetings, the Board 
oversees RELX’s financial performance and ensures its systems 
of risk management, internal control and corporate governance 
are fit for purpose and effectively underpin the delivery of its 
strategy. There are processes in place to manage the Board’s 
annual agenda, to ensure that all necessary items are submitted 
for its consideration at the appropriate time with sufficient 
supporting information, and to allow the Board adequate time 
to discuss and challenge strategic proposals. The Board’s annual 
programme and the agendas for the Committees are prepared 
by their respective Chairs with support from the Company 
Secretary. Board Committees are principally supported by 
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal 
Officer and Company Secretary, and the Chief Human Resources 
Officer, and other senior managers are invited to attend meetings 
where appropriate. 

Board discussions are informed through regular reports and 
presentations from senior management at Board and Committee 
meetings, and through deep-dive sessions into individual 
business areas, topics of strategic relevance and future 
developments that may impact RELX. Regular reports are 
provided, covering business area and overall strategies and 
financials, along with relevant regulatory, legislative and 
governance updates. RELX’s annual strategy review process 
comprehensively assesses its strategic position and key strategic 
options, considering opportunities and risks to its future success 
and the long-term sustainability and viability of its business 
model. The Board engaged in a two-day, in-depth strategy session 
in September.

Information and support
There are processes in place to ensure that the Board and its 
Committees receive relevant information at the right time and 
with the appropriate level of detail to inform decision-making and 
enable effective monitoring of management’s progress in 
accordance with agreed strategy. The Directors are provided with 
papers ahead of all scheduled Board and Committee meetings, 
containing management updates, relevant context and market 
information, and other supporting information and reports, 
as appropriate. 

All the Directors have access to the advice of the Company 
Secretary and may also take independent professional advice at 
the company’s expense where they deem this to be necessary 
for the furtherance of their duties to the company. The Company 
Secretary advises the Board on all corporate governance matters 
and ensures that all Board procedures are followed correctly. 
The Directors also have access to other members of RELX’s 
management, staff and external advisers.

Each of the Directors is expected to attend all meetings of the 
Board and of the Committees of which they are a member. 
However, in circumstances where a Director is unable to attend 
a meeting, they are provided with the relevant papers and have 
the opportunity to discuss any matters arising with the respective 
Chair and with their fellow Board and Committee members. 
All Directors are provided with a copy of the minutes of 
each meeting.

Director induction
Following appointment, and as required, all Directors 
receive a full, formal induction, that is tailored to their 
individual requirements, based on existing knowledge and 
experience. The Chair and Company Secretary are responsible 
for ensuring that an effective induction programme takes place 
for all new Directors.

During the year, Alistair Cox (appointed in April 2023) was provided 
with a comprehensive briefing pack including detailed information 
about each of RELX’s business areas, governance and internal 
controls, and recent reporting and investor materials, together 
with access to historical Board papers and minutes. To provide a 
sufficiently in-depth and current understanding of our operations, 
a number of meetings were organised with senior management 
from RELX’s business areas and corporate functions, as well as 
with the external auditor.

Ongoing development
For Directors to effectively discharge their responsibilities, it is 
important that they regularly refresh and update their skills and 
knowledge. The Board’s annual programme is designed with this 
in mind and ensures that the Directors have sufficiently in-depth 
knowledge of RELX’s business areas and operations and are kept 
apprised of relevant events and changes in RELX’s operating 
environment and markets. In 2023, the Directors took part in a 
deep-dive into the Legal and Exhibitions business areas, covering 
financial and operational performance by segment, product 
development and strategic plans. The Audit Committee also 
attended a series of technical deep-dive briefing sessions. 
Further information about the work and activities of the Audit 
Committee is available in the Audit Committee Report 149 to 152.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Purpose, strategy, values and culture

RELX places significant emphasis and importance on the way we do business. We are clear and unequivocal about our commitment to 
do so with integrity and in accordance with the highest ethical standards. 

Purpose
RELX is a provider of information-based analytics and decision 
tools for professional and business customers, enabling 
them to make better decisions, get better results and be 
more productive.

Our purpose is to benefit society by developing products that 
help researchers advance scientific knowledge; doctors and 
nurses improve the lives of patients; lawyers promote the rule 
of law and achieve justice and fair results for their clients; 
businesses and governments prevent fraud; consumers 
access financial services and get fair prices on insurance, and 
customers learn about markets and complete transactions.

data sets and analytics, and assets in high-growth markets that 
support our organic growth strategies and are natural additions 
to our existing business.

By focusing on evolving the fundamentals of our business we 
believe that, over time, we are improving our business profile 
and the quality of our earnings. This strategy has led to more 
predictable revenues through a better asset mix and 
geographic balance; improved returns by focusing on organic 
development with strong cash generation; and a higher growth 
profile as we expand in higher growth segments, exit from 
structurally challenged businesses, and gradually reduce the 
drag from print format declines.

Our purpose guides our actions beyond the products that we 
develop. It defines us as a company. Every day across RELX 
our employees are inspired to undertake initiatives that 
make unique contributions to society and the communities 
in which we operate.

Strategy
Our number one strategic priority is the organic development 
of increasingly sophisticated information-based analytics and 
decision tools that deliver enhanced value to professional and 
business customers. We aim to achieve leading positions in 
long-term global growth markets and leverage our skills, 
assets and resources across RELX, both to build solutions 
for our customers and to pursue cost efficiencies. We are 
systematically migrating all of our information solutions across 
RELX towards higher value-add decision tools, adding broader 
data sets, embedding more sophisticated analytics and 
leveraging more powerful technology, primarily through 
organic development. We are transforming our core business, 
building out new products and expanding into higher growth 
adjacencies and geographies. We are supplementing this 
organic development with selective acquisitions of targeted 

Values
We strive to do business with integrity. Our principle ‘Do the 
Right Thing’ embraces behaviours such as being honest in 
dealing with others, respecting each other, and courageously 
speaking out for what is right; thereby guiding our commitment 
to achieve business goals in an open, honest, ethical, and 
principled way. We ask our suppliers to meet the same 
standards, and provide support for them to do so as necessary.

Culture
As an information-based analytics and decision tool provider, 
our corporate culture is fact-based, data-driven and analytical. 
We are transparent and non-political in our decision-making. 
We are passionate about making a positive impact on society 
through our unique contributions as a business and our 
employees feel a strong sense of engagement with the 
business and its purpose. We focus on improving customer 
outcomes while emphasising corporate responsibility and 
acting with integrity and advancing inclusiveness and 
diversity. Our culture encourages community engagement, 
environmental responsibility and the well-being of our people.

How the Board monitors culture
RELX’s standards and values are defined on a group-wide basis, 
however the Board acknowledges that cultural practices and 
preferred ways of working can vary across the geographies of  
our business areas. The Board helps to build the culture of the 
organisation from the top down, by ensuring that it takes decisions 
that are aligned to RELX’s values. The Board regularly reviews 
RELX’s policies and Ethics Code to ensure the right framework 
is in place for RELX to operate with integrity, and that its working 
practices effectively promote a culture of strong engagement 
with our business and purpose, and with the communities that we 
serve and in which we operate. We strive to continually improve 
customer outcomes through a culture that is fact-based, 
data-driven and analytical. 

The Board has appointed a Non-Executive Workforce Engagement 
Director to engage directly with employee representatives from 
across RELX and to report back to the Board (further information 
about this engagement is on page 120). This provides the Board 
with insights into how culture is embedded across RELX’s 

business areas and functions and any issues that need to be 
addressed. The views of employees are also measured through 
annual employee engagement surveys, and a broader triennial 
opinion survey, designed to gauge how employees feel about the 
organisation, how well they understand its direction, and their 
level of satisfaction and engagement with their work. An analysis 
of the results is presented to the Board. The Board also receives 
regular reports and presentations containing culture-related 
employee data and updates on corporate responsibility activities 
from across each of RELX’s business areas. Such reports  
include progress against our people objectives in areas such  
as well-being, pay equity and reducing inequalities through 
inclusion. This contributes to the Board’s assessment of the 
culture at RELX and provides a context against which the Board 
has taken a number of its principal decisions during the year.

Through the activities of the Audit Committee, the Board receives 
updates on alleged and substantiated violations of the Ethics Code 
and significant matters raised through reporting channels, which 
provide insights into governance and compliance behaviours.

model on pages 5 to 11

	§ At a two-day strategy session in September, the Board discussed strategic initiatives for RELX and 
debated and approved RELX’s three year strategic plan for 2024 to 2026. RELX’s strategic priority 
continues to be the promotion of organic growth. The Board reviewed RELX’s value creation,  
capital expenditure and areas for potential acquisitions across all four business areas, and robust 
operational plans for delivery across RELX’s business areas for implementation by management.

	§ In June and September, the Directors attended presentations led by business area senior 

management. These included updates on strategy supplemented by presentations from subject 
matter experts on key products, innovations and areas of focus, and a final session for the Board 
to provide their feedback to senior management.

	§ The Board conducted reviews of RELX’s invested capital and capital structure during the year, 

including financial performance, potential and completed acquisitions, net debt, returns on invested 
capital, credit ratings, forecasts and financial market conditions and approved the annual budget.

	§ The Board reviewed the company’s purpose, strategy, values and culture statement and confirmed 

that it continues to represent why and how RELX operates and the standards to which those who work 
for and who represent RELX are held in the course of conducting our business and operations.

	§ The Board oversaw Director succession planning arrangements during the year. On the 

recommendation of the Nominations Committee, the Board approved the appointment of Bianca 
Tetteroo who will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2024, subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2024 AGM.

	§ Having the right people in leadership roles is an important factor in embedding the desired culture for 
RELX. The Nominations Committee and the Board were updated on the ongoing leadership talent 
reviews undertaken by management and plans for talent development across RELX’s business and 
functional areas.

	§ The RELX and Board Inclusion and Diversity policies were reviewed by the Board to ensure they 
remain fit for purpose and continue to align with our desired culture and effectively support our 
purpose and strategy. 

	§ The Board considered the results of the company-wide employee opinion survey conducted during 

2023 (further information is on page 54).

	§ RELX’s corporate responsibility activities formed a significant part of the Board’s agenda during the 
year and these are overseen by the Board on an ongoing basis. Detailed information about RELX’s 
corporate responsibility objectives and its progress towards these, together with our TCFD 
disclosures, are included in the Corporate Responsibility Report within this Annual Report, as 
approved by the Board.

	§ The Board reviewed and approved the company’s Modern Slavery Act Statement, which describes the 
steps taken by the Company and its subsidiaries to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking 
were not taking place in the context of RELX’s business operations and its supply chain during the

ongoing viability and approved the company’s Viability Statement.

	§ Feedback from the Board’s 2022 evaluation indicated that the Board’s agenda should include further 
updates on RELX’s assessment of material cyber and information security risks, and approach to 
mitigation and information security controls, on a regular basis. The Board received regular reports 
from the Head of Information Security and Data Protection on these matters and further updates from 
management on matters of particular significance to each of the four business areas. Cybersecurity

Stakeholder engagement

During the year, the Board undertook a review of RELX’s key stakeholders and concluded that they remain unchanged from the previous 
year. The Board received a detailed overview of stakeholder engagement channels and activities and confirmed that it has adequate 
visibility of the views of key stakeholders, which are taken into consideration in its decision-making. Further information about the 
nature and outcomes of the RELX’s engagement with its stakeholders are detailed throughout this Annual Report and examples of 
the Board’s engagement with key stakeholders are set out on the following pages.

Investors

Why effective engagement 
is important

Engagement with our 
investors helps them to 
understand our strategy, 
performance and 
governance arrangements, 
and to make informed 
decisions concerning the 
company. It also makes 
clear our prioritisation of 
the long term in our 
decision-making and focus 
on delivery of consistent 
financial performance. 

Our investors provide us 
with input and feedback 
concerning the 
development and 
implementation of our 
strategy, and we consider 
their views when making 
investment decisions.

How we engage, outcomes and impact

Engagement with our investors is undertaken by members of the Board and at a business level by 
senior management and our Investor Relations, Corporate Responsibility and Treasury teams. 
The Board is updated with feedback and commentary received from investors through business 
engagement, investor roadshows and meetings with institutional shareholders in respect of our 
recent and proposed activities.

The Board receives regular reports on the company’s share price and shareholder return 
performance and a review of analyst commentary in response to the company’s market 
announcements and results publications. Executive Directors and senior management gave a 
number of investor and analyst presentations during the year to provide further detail and context 
to our published results and strategy plans.

During the year: 

	§ Our engagement processes confirmed that investors in the main continue to understand and 

support our organic growth strategy. The Board considered this when approving RELX’s three-year 
strategic plan for 2024 to 2026, which leaves our strategic focus, and our priorities for uses of cash 
generated by RELX, broadly unchanged. 

	§ In response to interest from the investment community, RELX presented a demonstration of  
its new Legal AI tool, Lexis+ AI, at an event attended by over 200 investors and analysts. The 
presentation demonstrated the strategic position of our Legal business in the AI space and the 
Board were provided with the feedback from attendees. Further information about Lexis+ AI is on 
page 10.

	§ Senior management led an investor seminar on our Risk business, with a focus on Insurance 

Services. The presentation demonstrated the continued evolution of Risk, covering its markets, 
customers, growth trajectory and technological capabilities, and included an open Q&A session. 
The presentation is available at 
 www.relx.com/investors

	§ The Company’s AGM in 2023 was a valuable opportunity for Directors to interact directly with 
shareholders, to hear their views and answer questions about the business of the meeting.

	§ RELX’s material communications to investors, including trading updates, the Annual Report 

and Notice of AGM were reviewed and approved by the Board prior to release.

	§ In respect of shareholder returns, the Board considered a range of investor and analyst views, 

balancing the impact of returning capital to shareholders with stakeholder interests in other key 
RELX financial metrics, and subsequently approved the quantum of the company’s share buyback 
programme for 2023 and declared and recommended an interim and final dividend payment during 
the year.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Employees

Why effective engagement 
is important

Our people’s well-being and 
their commitment to the work 
they do are essential to our 
future growth and our aim to 
successfully build long-term 
leading positions in global 
growth markets.

We strive to foster an 
environment in which our 
employees feel a strong sense of 
engagement with our business 
and share a passion for making 
a positive impact on society 
through our unique 
contributions. RELX actively 
seeks feedback from employees 
to understand their key 
challenges and concerns and 
where we can work to address 
these. Hearing their views on 
what we do well, and what we 
can do better, is an important 
driver for improvement and 
enables us to take action to 
retain our best talent.

Effective engagement helps to 
mitigate the risk of not being 
able to recruit, motivate and 
retain skilled employees and 
management, which is 
recognised as a principal 
risk (see page 101).

How we engage, outcomes and impact

Employee engagement routinely takes place at business level and matters of concern are cascaded 
up through our management framework. The Board receives regular management reports  
which cover employee engagement, turnover and demographic analysis, updates on workplace 
initiatives, progress towards I&D objectives, and concerns raised through our Ethics Code 
reporting channels. The Board takes time to review employee engagement and workforce data 
and takes this into consideration during wider discussions.

RELX has a dedicated intranet for employees which is kept updated with financial and performance 
information, news of business developments and workforce initiatives and events (including in I&D) 
and other important messages from senior management. 

The Board has appointed Marike van Lier Lels as our Non-Executive Workforce Engagement 
Director to engage directly with employee representatives from across RELX and to report to 
the Board on the progress of RELX’s workforce initiatives, together with the challenges, concerns 
and priorities of employees. This provides the Board with insight into the culture across RELX, 
how our working practices and initiatives have been received and highlights any issues that need 
to be addressed.

During the year: 

	§ Ms van Lier Lels, met with workforce representatives to learn about the experiences of 

employees while working at RELX. Ms van Lier Lels reported to the Board on the matters 
discussed. These included positive feedback about RELX’s mentorship programmes, which are 
monitored by management to track their impact on employee performance, retention and net 
promoter scores. Further matters included the impact of ongoing hybrid working arrangements 
in different business areas, and RELX’s training programmes and opportunities. 

	§ In 2023 we undertook our annual Pulse employee opinion survey. An analysis of the results of 
the survey was presented to the Board in December and confirmed positive trends across all 
business areas in the key metrics of engagement, satisfaction, commitment and employee net 
promoter scores. 

	§ Board reports from the Chief Human Resources Officer highlighted the steps taken to identify, 
support and develop current and future leaders across the business through Organisational 
Talent Review and Management Development Planning processes. This focus has seen 
increased gender diversity across internal succession pipelines, complemented by targeted 
senior level recruitment. 

	§ The Board endorsed the development of a group-wide leadership framework for management 
and executive leaders, to unify and simplify existing frameworks and ensure leaders across our 
business areas continue to develop the skills and behaviours that drive our strategy, role model 
our values and champion our culture.

	§ The Board reviewed the Board and RELX Inclusion and Diversity Policies and determined that 

these continue to be fit for purpose and effective.

	§ The Board received a presentation from the Head of Corporate Communications on focus areas 
for 2023, which included consideration of the most effective methods to deliver key information 
about the business to the wider workforce, and for continuing to develop understanding of our 
purpose, strategy and values. Employee understanding and engagement with our purpose and 
strategy is monitored through our employee opinion survey scores over time.

	§ Employee involvement in the company’s performance is encouraged through RELX’s employee 
share schemes, which were refreshed and put to shareholders for approval at the 2023 AGM. 
The RELX PLC Employee Share Purchase Plan was also introduced in the US to enable a greater 
proportion of RELX employees the opportunity to purchase ADRs at a discounted price.

Customers

Why effective engagement 
is important

Our goal is to help customers 
make better decisions, get better 
results and be more productive. 
We do this by leveraging a deep 
understanding of their needs 
and views to create innovative 
solutions.

Collaborating closely with our 
customers is crucial for us to 
understand where and how we 
can improve the quality of our 
services and products, and 
enables us to make targeted 
investment decisions, such as 
to develop new or emerging 
technologies or complement 
our existing capabilities through 
acquisition activity.

Suppliers

Why effective engagement 
is important

RELX has a diverse supply 
chain with suppliers located 
in over 150 countries across 
multiple categories, which 
RELX categorises as content 
suppliers and non-content 
suppliers.

Collaboration and two-way 
dialogue with our suppliers 
helps ensure that we are able 
to maintain and improve the 
quality of products and services 
we provide to our customers. 
Effective engagement 
underpins our ability to 
maintain an ethical supply 
chain, giving us visibility of our 
suppliers’ commitment to 
good practices.

How we engage, outcomes and impact

Our engagement with customers takes place at an operational level across our business areas, 
through our dedicated sales and operations teams and through customer training and workshops. 
Material customer issues are cascaded up to the appropriate senior management. The Board 
received presentations during the year from customer-facing employees which detailed the nature 
of our customer engagement and the actions taken by the business areas as a result. In 2023, the 
Board received analysis of customers by sector and geography and data concerning the resilience 
of the markets in which we operate. The Board reviewed customer survey data, Net Promoter 
Scores, and customer usage volumes across our business areas.

During the year: 

	§ The Board continued to monitor current and anticipated future customer demand and market 
activity together with customer feedback, to understand how our product offerings address 
customer requirements. This information informed the areas of focus for product development 
and acquisitions and the level of investment required. RELX made several acquisitions during 
the year that complement its existing product range and enhance value for our customers. 
More information about our acquisitions during the year can be found on pages 9, 15, 27 and 32.

	§ Feedback from our customers informed the Board and management’s assessment of the areas 
in which RELX should build out new products and services, the speed at which this should be 
undertaken, and where it should look to expand into higher growth adjacencies and geographies 
over varying time horizons.

How we engage, outcomes and impact

Engagement with our content suppliers, which include the companies we license content or data 
from, as well as authors, editors, content reviewers and product designers, takes place principally 
through ongoing dialogue with the relevant business area to which the content is provided.  
Content supplier feedback is collected through direct relationships and regular business reviews, 
and presented to the Board through updates from our business area leaders.

Our non-content suppliers represent more typical vendor-type relationships, such as IT 
software and cloud service providers, or third parties to whom we have outsourced support 
function activities. Engagement takes place at various levels throughout RELX. Feedback is 
reported to the Board by business area leaders and the Global Head of Purchasing and Property.

During the year: 

	§ Outcomes of ongoing business engagement with our content suppliers, including Net Promoter 
Scores and the outcomes of business reviews, informed the Board’s discussions during its 
consideration of RELX’s three-year strategy plan for 2023 to 2026, and its assessment of 
mitigations in place for our principal risks of customer acceptance of products and supply 
chain dependencies.

	§ Our Supplier Code of Conduct has been translated into 16 languages for use across RELX.  

The Board continues to support our Socially Responsible Supplier (SRS) programme (further 
details are on pages 69 to 72). The Board also reviewed and approved our Modern Slavery Act 
Statement, available from 
 www.relx.com, which sets out the steps taken by the Company 
and its subsidiaries to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its business and 
supply chain.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Community

Why effective engagement 
is important

Our focus on community 
includes those where we, our 
customers and suppliers work 
around the world, as well as 
the communities we serve, 
including in science, academia, 
risk, law and many other fields.

We prioritise positive dialogue 
with our community 
stakeholders as we believe they, 
collectively, provide our ‘licence 
to operate’. Our efforts are 
informed by our commitment 
to the United Nations Global 
Compact and its ten principles, 
focused on human rights, 
labour, the environment and 
anti-corruption – all issues 
with wide societal impact.

How we engage, outcomes and impact

We engage with our community stakeholders through our unique contributions to society, and 
through our comprehensive global community programme, RELX Cares. The RELX Cares 
mission is the education of disadvantaged young people. Further information about our RELX 
Cares projects and its contributions to the communities in which we operate is on pages 65 to 68.

In accordance with the Business for Societal Impact model, we monitor the short- and long-term 
benefits of our community engagement. We survey RELX Cares volunteers to understand the 
impact of the programme on their personal development and how it affects the way they feel 
about working at RELX.

Relevant ESG considerations are incorporated into business review and strategy papers 
reviewed by the Board.

During the year: 

	§ The Board considered RELX’s environmental performance and supported ongoing initiatives 
for minimising our environmental impact, and continued to endorse our commitment to our 
reaching net zero by 2040. More information is in our Corporate Responsibility Report on 
pages 38 to 90.

	§ The Board received comprehensive updates on community engagement during the year, 

including key metrics, objectives and outcomes. Board feedback and support for community 
engagement shapes the direction of our charitable programmes and future plans.

	§ The Board continued to endorse RELX’s volunteering policy through which RELX employees 

receive two days paid leave each year to undertake community volunteering work.

	§ The Board supported the business areas utilising their unique product offerings to support 

causes in their communities. 

External appointments and Non-Executive Director independence
The Board has in place formal procedures to evaluate and review 
the external commitments of Directors, each of whom are 
required to obtain the Board’s approval prior to accepting new 
significant external appointments. During the year, the Board 
reviewed proposed external appointments of Suzanne Wood and 
Robert MacLeod. It was concluded that these appointments would 
not impact either Director’s ability to effectively perform their 
respective roles on the Board of RELX PLC, and accordingly 
the Board gave its approval in each instance. 

When Directors take up new external appointments, any related 
commercial relationships with RELX are reviewed, and any 
potential conflicts of interest are dealt with following formal 
procedures. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, Directors who are not conflicted may authorise, 
as appropriate, situations where a Director has an interest 
that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with those of RELX, 
and may impose conditions on such authorisations. 

Supported by the Nominations Committee, the Board monitors 
the independence of the Non-Executive Directors in line with  
the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
An annual evaluation, led by the Nominations Committee, 
considered whether length of service or any other factor has or 
may impact the ability of any Non-Executive Director to remain 
independent in character and judgement in the furtherance of his 
or her duties to the Company. The Board determined that each of 
the Non-Executive Directors is considered to be independent of 
management and free from any business or other relationship 
which could materially interfere with their ability to exercise 
independent judgement (with the exception of the Chair, whose 
independence was not assessed, but who was deemed to be 
independent upon appointment).

independent judgement (with the exception of the Chair, whose 

independence was not assessed, but who was deemed to be 

independent upon appointment). 

Board evaluation 

The Directors consider the evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees to be an important aspect of corporate governance. 
The Board undertakes an annual evaluation of its own 
effectiveness and performance, and that of its Committees 
and each individual Director.

Actions from the 2022 Board evaluation
In the 2022 Board evaluation, the Board agreed that it should 
continue to focus on the competitor landscape and on the key risks 
facing RELX, including cyber and data security. It was also noted 
that maintaining effective levels of engagement with RELX’s  
key stakeholders and continuing to promote constructive 
relationships between the Non-Executive Directors and 
management should remain priorities for the Board. As part  
of the 2023 evaluation, the Board members confirmed that these 
actions had been appropriately addressed during 2023, through 
regular reporting, presentations and deep dives provided by 
senior management.

2023 Evaluation process
In 2023, the Board evaluation process was externally facilitated 
by an independent consultancy, Manchester Square Partners, 
and was supported by the Company Secretary. Manchester 
Square Partners has no other connections with the Company 
and the consultants were given full access to the Board and 
Committee papers for the relevant period. 

The evaluation consisted of a questionnaire completed by all 
Directors, one-to-one interviews with each member of the Board, 
a presentation of the final report, and facilitation of a discussion 
around key findings and action points to take forward.

The Directors were asked to provide their feedback and 
commentary on the following areas:

	§ Board composition and effectiveness
	§ Quality of information provided by management
	§ Boardroom culture and dynamics
	§ Effectiveness of the Board’s oversight of strategy 

development, setting and monitoring the RELX’s culture and 
values, financial performance, market developments, 
stakeholder relations (including the Board’s understanding 
and visibility of the views of RELX’s stakeholders and how 
these inform its decision-making process), talent and 
succession, inclusion and diversity, risk and governance

	§ The structure, leadership and overall effectiveness of each 

of the Board’s Committees

Chair’s Assessment
The Directors reported that the transition to a new Chair had been 
very smooth and successful and reported highly positive Board 
dynamics under Mr Walker’s leadership. The Directors felt that 
Mr Walker effectively enabled and encouraged challenge and 
contributions from the Non-Executive Directors. His demonstrably 
strong interest in the business areas and the amount of time he 
invested in preparing for meetings of the Board and in building 
relationships with senior management was highly regarded by  
the others on the Board. 

Individual director performance
The evaluation provided opportunity for reflection on personal 
development and individual Director performance. The findings 
of this evaluation highlighted that each Director continues to 
contribute positively and effectively both within and outside  
Board and Committee meetings and constructively challenges 
management on key issues. Through the evaluation process it 
was also confirmed that each Non-Executive Director remains 
independent and has sufficient time to devote to their respective 
roles on the RELX Board.

Conclusions from the 2023 Board evaluation
In 2023, the externally facilitated Board evaluation concluded that 
the Board continues to promote good governance and oversight 
and provides important challenge, insight and support to 
management, especially around key decisions. Each of the 
Committees is considered to be well-chaired and to be operating 
effectively. Board members who are not a member of a particular 
Committee reported that they feel appropriately informed of 
its activities. 

The overall culture and dynamics of the Board are considered  
to be very positive. There is a high degree of comfort in the 
decision-making process, supported by well-prepared papers, 
that takes into account the questions and input of the Non-
Executive Directors. Board and Committee meetings are 
well-planned, efficiently run and effectively cover the critical 
issues. The RELX strategy session in September was well 
received and the Board’s annual agenda is thought to have an 
appropriate balance of business and governance focus. Business 
and strategy materials from management are of a high quality 
and provide a sound basis for broad ranging debate and input 
from Board members. The Directors thought that the depth and 
breadth of capability and the diversity of thought and experience 
on the Board contributed to highly effective meetings. 

The key findings of the Board evaluation confirmed that the  
Board and its Committees continue to function effectively and 
collaboratively with an appropriate level of engagement with 
management. While there were no specific areas identified where 
significant improvement is required, the Board recognised the 
importance of continued focus on cyber security and its own  
role in the event of a significant incident. It considered that 
opportunities for optimising business growth should continue 
to feature in its future strategy discussions with management.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Audit, risk and internal control

Internal control and risk management  
The Board has overall responsibility for overseeing RELX’s 
systems of risk management and internal control and for 
monitoring the processes for identifying, assessing and managing 
the principal and emerging risks faced by the Company. These 
systems are designed to manage and mitigate, rather than totally 
eliminate, risks to the business. Accordingly, they can provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. These processes were in place throughout 
the year ended 31 December 2023, and up to the date of approval 
of the 2023 Annual Report. Further details of RELX’s risk 
management systems and the principal and emerging risks 
facing the Company, together with our mitigation strategies are 
set out on pages 98 to 103 of this Report. 

Risk management and control procedures are embedded into 
the operations of the business and include the monitoring of 
progress in areas for improvement that come to management 
and Board attention. 

To provide reasonable assurance against material inaccuracies 
or loss, and of the effectiveness of the systems of internal control 
and risk management, RELX has adopted the three lines of 
defence assurance model as set out below.

The Board and Audit Committee

Note: In addition to RELX’s internal controls, RELX is also audited externally. 
The report of the external auditor has been included from pages 158 to 165.

RELX operates authorisation and approval processes 
throughout its operations. Access controls exist where 
processes have been automated to ensure the security of data. 
Management information systems have been developed to identify 
risks and enable the assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
control systems.

With the close involvement of operating management and central 
functions, the risk management and control procedures aim to 
ensure that RELX is managing its business risks effectively and in 
a coordinated manner across the business areas with clarity on 
the respective responsibilities and interdependencies. Litigation, 
and other legal and regulatory matters, are managed by legal 
directors in the business areas. 

The Audit Committee has responsibility for monitoring RELX’s 
risk management and internal control procedures and reports to 
the Board, as appropriate. The Audit Committee receives periodic 
updates from RELX’s Chief Compliance Officer on alleged and 
substantiated violations of the Ethics Code, and related training, 
monitoring and communications programmes. Such updates 
covered the volume, type and circumstances surrounding 
substantiated violations, subsequent actions and lessons learnt.

During the year, RELX has continued to implement its inclusion 
strategy to advance progress towards its 2020 to 2025 inclusion 
goals. This covers all aspects of diversity and aims to translate 
the Group I&D Policy into tangible and measurable actions. 
Workforce policies and practices are regularly reviewed to ensure 
RELX is delivering on its inclusion, equity and diversity goals and 
effectively monitoring available diversity data. 

Across our business areas, we are committed to providing regular 
best practice and awareness training in areas such as inclusive 
leadership and unconscious bias and we promote and encourage 
inclusive networking groups and sponsorship and mentoring 
programmes. Details of the strategy and progress towards 
fulfilling our I&D initiatives is set out in our Corporate 
Responsibility Report on pages 54 to 59. 

Data for the diversity characteristics table on page 126 was drawn 
from HR information where consents are in place to use the data 
on an anonymised basis and through a survey with categories 
aligned to those set out in the LRs.

Board and Committee succession
When reviewing the composition of the Board and its Committees, 
the Nominations Committee considers, among other things,  
the length of tenure of each Director and the need for, and benefits 
of, membership being regularly refreshed. The Committee is 
cognisant of the skills and experience required for effective 
leadership and oversight of RELX’s strategy for success in the  
long term, and of the requirements of our Board I&D Policy and the 
UK Listing Rules designed to promote greater female and ethnic 
minority representation. All appointments to the RELX Board,  
and each of its Committees, are based primarily on merit and the 
suitability of an individual for any given role.

Board succession planning and refreshment was a regular 
agenda item at the Committee’s meetings during 2023. 
Dr Wolfhart Hauser retired at the Company’s annual general 
meeting in 2023 at which time he also stepped down as Senior 
Independent Director (SID), Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
and member of the Nominations Committee. The Committee 
recommended to the Board that Suzanne Wood be appointed to 
the role of SID and to membership of the Nominations Committee, 
and that Robert MacLeod succeed Dr Hauser as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. The Committee’s recommendations 
were based on its evaluation of the specific skills and experience 
required for each role, together with the capacity of individual 
directors to take up additional duties, and with regard to our 
diversity objectives.

The Committee also recommended the appointment of two new 
NEDs during the year: Alistair Cox, who joined the Board in  
April 2023, and Bianca Tetteroo who will join the Board in 2024, 
subject to her election by shareholders at the Company’s AGM,  
as announced on 8 December 2023. Marike van Lier Lels will  
retire at the Company’s AGM in 2024, having served on the Board 
since 2015. 

Director appointment process
A rigorous search and appointment process was followed for 
each new NED, starting with the preparation of a search 
specification, based on the Committee’s assessment of the skills 
and composition of the Board and the capabilities and experience 
required going forward. Russell Reynolds Associates was 
engaged to support the search and the Board confirms that 

none of the Directors have any connection with executive search  
firms utilised by the Company. A short-list of potentially suitable 
individuals was considered in detail by the Committee and 
preferred candidates were invited to meet with Board members, 
including the Chair and the Chief Executive Officer, together with 
the Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary. Following 
feedback from these sessions, the Nominations Committee made 
its recommendations to the Board. The Board then had a further 
opportunity to review and discuss the recommendations, and 
subsequently approved the appointments of Alistair Cox and 
Bianca Tetteroo.

The Board may appoint Directors (subject to a maximum upper 
limit) to fill a vacancy at any time, although any Director so 
appointed shall only hold office until the following AGM of the 
Company, at which his or her election shall be voted upon by 
shareholders. Directors are then required to seek re-election  
by shareholders at each subsequent AGM of the Company. As a 
general rule, letters of appointment for NEDs provide that, subject 
to annual re-election by shareholders, individuals will serve for  
an initial period of three years, and are typically expected to be 
available to serve for a second three-year period. If invited to do 
so, they may also serve for a third three-year period. The notice 
period applicable to the NEDs is one month. RELX’s Non-Executive 
Letter of Appointment sets out the time commitment required by 
the Company from its Non-Executive Directors. 

Executive and management succession
The Board is committed to recognising and nurturing talent 
across RELX and overseeing the development of a strong talent 
pipeline to senior leadership and executive roles. The Committee 
received detailed updates during the year from the Chief Executive 
Officer regarding succession plans for senior management roles. 
This included broad views on potential timings and implications for 
diversity. The Committee is satisfied that appropriate succession 
planning arrangements were in place during the year to facilitate 
appropriate and effective succession across senior management 
roles, supported by a strong pipeline of candidates.

Conflicts of interest
The Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which 
they have, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts 
with the interests of the Company and, if potential for such a 
conflict arises, must make such situations known to the Board.  
In accordance with its terms of reference, the Nominations 
Committee considers the circumstances of any such actual or 
potential conflicts of interest and makes a recommendation to the 
Board as to whether to authorise the conflict, as permitted under 
the Company’s Articles. The Committee may recommend that  
the Board imposes certain limits or conditions in respect of the 
conflict. There is a procedure in place for Directors to disclose any 
potential conflict to the Board and each Director is required to 
review and confirm their actual and potential conflicts annually. 
During the year, the Committee conducted a formal review of the 
conflict of interest authorisations granted by the Board to each 
individual Director. 

Committee evaluation
The evaluation of the Committee determined that it was well 
governed and effective in carrying out its role in accordance with 
its Terms of Reference. Details of the Board and Committee 
evaluation process are on page 123.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Directors’ Remuneration Report

The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) in accordance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the UK Listing Rules and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended (the UK Regulations). The Report was approved by the Board. 

I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2023. This is my first report as Chair of the 
Committee, having succeeded Wolfhart Hauser who retired from the Board in April 2023. I would like to thank Wolfhart for his valuable 
contribution and leadership of the Committee over the years.

As you will have seen earlier in the annual report, the Company delivered strong revenue and profit growth in 2023, driven by the ongoing 
shift in business mix towards higher growth information based analytics and decision tools that deliver enhanced value to our 
customers across market segments. We have been able to develop and deploy these tools across the Company for well over a decade 
and we are confident that our ability to leverage artificial intelligence and other technologies, as they evolve, will continue to be an 
important driver of customer value and growth in our business for many years to come. 

Underlying revenue growth was 8%, underlying adjusted operating profit growth was 13% and at constant currency, adjusted EPS 
growth was 11%. We are proposing an increase in the full-year dividend of 8%. Our Total Shareholder Return outperformed the FTSE 100 
over the last three, five and ten year periods as shown on page 138. 

The purpose of RELX is to benefit society by developing products that help researchers advance scientific knowledge; doctors and 
nurses improve the lives of patients; lawyers promote the rule of law and achieve justice and fair results for their clients; businesses and 
governments prevent fraud; consumers access financial services and get fair prices on insurance; and customers learn about markets 
and complete transactions. Our purpose guides our actions beyond the products that we develop. It defines us as a company. Every day 
across RELX our employees are inspired to undertake initiatives that make unique contributions to society and the communities in which 
we operate. We see what we do as a company as being an integral part of our commitment to environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) performance. We have set sustainability objectives which reflect our focus on our unique contributions to society and  
align to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to do our part to advance this ambitious global agenda by 2030.  
We are continuing to reduce our environmental impact to meet our 2025 environmental targets. Our performance was again recognised 
by external rating agencies: RELX achieved a AAA ESG rating with MSCI for an eighth consecutive year, was ranked second in our sector 
by Sustainalytics, maintained fifth place in the Responsibility 100 Index and was a constituent of the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index 
for the fifth consecutive year. More information can be found on pages 38 to 90. 

Remuneration policy and implementation
An updated Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 20 April 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM) with 95.87% in 
favour. I would like to express again my gratitude for the feedback received during the shareholder engagement as we were developing 
the policy and for the high level of support for the policy. The policy, which applies for three years from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM is 
set out on pages 142 to 148 of this report. The first awards under the policy will be granted in the first quarter of 2024. The 2023 awards 
are subject to the policy approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM and can be found on pages 90 to 96 of the 2019 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements, available on relx.com. 

Shareholders will be invited to vote (by way of an advisory vote) on the 2023 Annual Remuneration Report at the 2024 AGM.

Our strategic direction remains unchanged:  to develop increasingly sophisticated information-based analytics and decision tools that 
deliver enhanced value to professional and business customers across market segments.  We are primarily focused on organic growth, 
supported by targeted acquisitions. This should lead to a higher growth profile and a positive impact on society and, when combined with 
our strategy of driving continuous process innovation to manage cost growth below revenue growth, result in strong earnings growth 
and improving returns.

The performance measures in the incentive plans align with the strategy and the financial key performance indicators on page 6 of the 
annual report, by focusing on sustained earnings growth, return on invested capital and shareholder returns in the LTIP. The AIP is 
based on revenue, profit, cash flow and sustainability metrics and focuses on annual objectives and milestones and creates a platform 
for sustainable future performance. 

The performance measures are based on adjusted figures as they provide relevant information in assessing the Company’s 
performance, position and cash flows and we believe they track the core operational performance of RELX and how it contributes 
to shareholder value creation. The Annual Report includes a reconciliation of adjusted measures to IFRS measures.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Directors’ Remuneration Report

129

The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) in accordance with the 

UK Corporate Governance Code, the UK Listing Rules and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 

(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended (the UK Regulations). The Report was approved by the Board. 

2023 outcomes
RELX delivered strong organic revenue and adjusted operating profit growth rates. These results drove an AIP payout of 87% of the 
maximum. Details of our targets and achievements for the year are shown on pages 131 and 132.

I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2023. This is my first report as Chair of the 

Committee, having succeeded Wolfhart Hauser who retired from the Board in April 2023. I would like to thank Wolfhart for his valuable 

Financial and share price performance was very strong over the past three years, with TSR outperforming our UK, US and European 
peer groups. As a result, the LTIP payout is 100% of the maximum. Details of our targets and achievements are shown on page 133. 

In determining the level of payout under the annual and the multi-year incentives, the Committee took into account RELX’s overall 
business performance and value created for shareholders and other relevant factors and determined that the outcomes were fair 
and appropriate and applied no discretion to the payouts.

Broader employee considerations
The Board reviews information on employee metrics and updates on employee related matters including inclusion and diversity, as 
well as outcomes of employee surveys conducted during the year. In addition, our designated Non-Executive Director responsible for 
workforce engagement, Marike van Lier Lels, continued to meet with employee representatives from Europe, US and Asia Pacific during 
2023 and reported back to the Board. Further information on the workforce engagement process is provided in the Governance section 
on page 120. The Committee also reviews annual salary increase guidelines globally. 

When determining the remuneration for Executive Directors and Senior Executives, the Committee considers business and individual 
performance as well as other factors including broader employee reward.

The Committee is satisfied that the overall remuneration for Executive Directors is appropriate and fair having considered external  
and internal relativities.

The Committee is satisfied that the incentive schemes drive the desired behaviours to support the Company’s purpose, values  
and strategy. 

Implementation of the Remuneration Policy in 2024
The Committee has approved 2024 salary increases for the Executive Directors of 2.5%. 

As highlighted in the 2022 report and in accordance with the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM, the level 
of vesting for threshold performance in the LTIP will reduce from 25% of the maximum opportunity to 20% and incentives will be subject 
to broader malus and clawback provisions. 

The Committee also approved a new US clawback policy in compliance with new US listing standards adopted in June 2023, providing for 
the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation by current or former executive officers, in the event the company is 
required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the 
securities laws. Our malus and clawback policy includes broader triggers than the US clawback requirements (see page 144).

Further details regarding the implementation of the policy in 2024 can be found on page 140.

(1)  Benefits are typically comprised of a car allowance, private medical/dental insurance and the cost of tax return preparation.

(2)  50% of the AIP is paid in shares deferred for three years. Dividend equivalents accrue on these shares.

(3)  The 2023 figures reflect the vesting of the 2021–2023 cycle of the LTIP. As the LTIP vests after the approval date of this Report, the 

average share price for the last quarter of 2023 has been used to arrive at an estimated figure in respect of these awards, in line with 
the methodology prescribed by the UK Regulations. 

The estimated figures for 2022 disclosed in last year’s Report have been restated to reflect the actual amount of the 2020-2022 
cycle of the LTIP vested and the actual share price, which increased the 2022 disclosed figure by £383k for the CEO and by £188k for 
the CFO. The vesting percentage was determined on 17 February 2023 and was in line with the one disclosed on page 127 of the 2022 
Remuneration Report.

For Erik Engstrom, the amount that directly reflects share price appreciation is £0.8m for 2022 and £3.4m for 2023. For Nick Luff, 
these numbers are £0.4m for 2022 and £1.7m for 2023. 

The awards are due to vest in February 2024 and the 2023 figures will be restated in next year’s report to reflect actual values  
at vesting.

(1)   Targets are set on an underlying basis for revenue and on a constant currency basis for adjusted net profit, and reflect targeted growth, with cash flow based on the 

targeted cash conversion. Target amounts presented in sterling reflect actual movements in exchange rates relative to their equivalent constant currency amounts. 

(2)   The maximum for each measure is 150% of on target. The overall maximum is 200% of salary.

As highlighted earlier, underlying revenue growth was 8%. Underlying adjusted operating profit growth was 13% and at constant currency, adjusted EPS growth was 11%. 
Some figures add up to different amounts than the totals due to rounding.

50% of the AIP will be paid in cash in Q1 2024 and the remainder is paid in Deferred Shares which will be released in Q1 2027. The release 
of Deferred Shares is not subject to any further performance conditions but is subject to malus and clawback.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Non-financial measures 
We have set sustainability objectives which reflect our focus on our unique contributions to society, as well as sustainability  issues 
more broadly. We align all our objectives to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to do our part to advance this 
ambitious global agenda by 2030. 

We have chosen to include sustainability metrics in the AIP so that we can update these metrics depending on current situation. 

Purchase of renewable electricity is no longer a specific measure this year as the target has been met. We will however continue 
to track this metric and may consider including again if relevant. 

We have replaced the previous metric regarding the number of strategic partners to the RELX SDG Resource centre with a metric 
related to the number of users of the SDG Resource centre. The Universal access to information measure therefore reflects not only 
the Company’s efforts to provide access to information by increasing content on the Resource centre, but also measures the use of 
the centre. 

Our environmental targets align with our 2025 targets. More information can be found on pages 73 to 80.

Non-financial measures represent 10% of the AIP. Of this component, achievements and payouts were as follows:

Payout for carbon reduction was capped at 90% of target in the year in recognition of the changes in office work patterns and business 
travel since the target was set.

2021–2023 LTIP 

Set out below is a summary of performance against each measure of the LTIP cycle 1 January 2021–31 December 2023. 

The targets remained unchanged from when these were set at the beginning of 2021. As noted in the Chair letter, financial performance 
was very strong and significant value was generated for shareholders through share price appreciation and dividends over the 
performance period. RELX’s TSR outperformed the UK, US and European peer groups over the period. The payout is 100% of maximum.

(1)   Calculated on a straight-line basis for performance between the points.
(2)   Growth in adjusted EPS at constant currency and ROIC are calculated as set out in the Chief Financial Officer’s report and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, 
with adjustments made to remove the effect on ROIC of changes in exchange rates, pension deficits and accounting standards over the three-year performance period. 

The performance measures used in incentive plans are based on adjusted figures as they provide relevant information in assessing  
the Company’s performance, position and cash flows and we believe they track the core operational performance of RELX and how it 
contributes to shareholder value creation. The Annual Report includes a reconciliation of adjusted measures to IFRS measures.

(1)   Benefits comprise the notional benefit of tax filing support provided to Non-Executive Directors for filings outside their home country resulting from their directorships 

with RELX. The incremental assessable benefit charge per tax return for 2023 was £840 (unchanged from 2022) for a UK tax return. Paul Walker’s benefits relate to private 
medical insurance. Further, the Company meets all reasonable travel, subsistence, accommodation and other expenses, including any tax where such expenses are 
deemed taxable, incurred by the Non-Executive Directors and the Chair in the course of performing their duties.

(5)   Succeeded Dr Hauser as Senior Independent Director and became a member of the Nomination Committee from the AGM on 20 April 2023.

The total remuneration for Directors is set out in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.

transatlantic journey made in order to attend a RELX Board or Committee meeting during 2023.

Fees may be reviewed annually, although in practice they have changed on a less frequent basis. Before the changes which took effect 
on 1 January 2024, the Chair fee was last changed in 2018 and the NED base fee was last changed in 2020. The new fees represent a per 
annum increase slightly below the general UK employee salary increase guidelines of 2.5%. Other NED fees were last amended in 2016 
or 2018.

Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and other share interests (audited)
Shareholding requirement 
The Committee believes that a closer alignment of interests can be created between senior management and shareholders if executives 
build and maintain a significant personal stake in RELX. The shareholding requirements applicable to the Executive Directors are set 
out in the table below. Shares that count for this purpose are (i) any type of RELX security of which the Director, their spouse, civil partner 
or dependent child has beneficial ownership of and (ii) AIP deferred shares which are within their three-year deferral period, on a 
notional net (after tax) basis. There has been no change to the interests reported below between 31 December 2023 and the date of this 
Report.

Meeting the shareholding requirement is both a vesting condition for LTIP awards granted and a requirement to maintain eligibility for 
future LTIP awards. On termination of employment, Executive Directors are to maintain their full shareholding requirement (or, if lower, 
their actual level of shareholding at the time of leaving) for two years after leaving employment. 

On 31 December 2023, the Executive Directors’ shareholdings were as follows: 

Erik Engstrom
Nick Luff

Shareholding requirement  
(% of 2023 annual base salary)
450%
300%

Shareholding as at 
31 December 2023 (% of 2023

(1)   Includes AIP deferred shares which are within their three-year deferral period, on a notional net (after tax) basis (63,845 for Erik Engstrom and 37,596 for Nick Luff).
For disclosure purposes, any PLC ADRs held are included as ordinary shares.

The total remuneration for Directors is set out in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.

(1)   The face value of the LTIP awards and AIP deferred shares granted in February 2023 was calculated using the middle market quotation of a PLC ordinary share (£24.92). 

This share price was used to determine the number of awards granted.

The LTIP awards granted in 2023 are based on ROIC, EPS and TSR weighted 40%:40%:20% respectively and assessed independently. 
The targets and vesting scales applicable to these awards are set out on page 134 of the 2022 Remuneration Report.

We chose Option A as we believe it is the most robust and accurate 
way to identify the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile 
UK employee. 

The Committee is satisfied that the overall picture presented 
by the 2023 pay ratios is consistent with the pay, reward and 
progression policies for the Group’s UK employees.

	§ Salaries for all UK employees, including the Executive 

Directors, are set based on a wide range of factors, including 
market practice, scope and impact of the role and experience. 

	§ The provision of certain benefits and the level of benefit 

provided vary depending on the role and level of seniority. 

	§ Participation in annual incentive plans varies by business and 
reflects the culture and the nature of the business, as well 
as role. 

	§ Whilst none of the comparator employees participate in the 

executive share plans, they do have the opportunity to receive 
company shares via the UK Sharesave Option Plan. A greater 
proportion of performance-related variable pay and share 
based awards applies to more senior executives, including  
the Executive Directors, who have a greater influence over 
performance outcomes.

 Relative importance of spend on pay
The following table sets out the total employee costs for all 
employees, as well as the amounts paid in dividends and 
share repurchases.

Payments to past Directors and payments for loss of office 
(audited)
There have been no payments for loss of office in 2023.

Comparison of change in Directors’ pay with change  
in employee pay
The UK Regulations require companies to disclose the percentage 
change in remuneration from 2022 to 2023 for each director 
compared with the employees of the listed company, excluding 
directors. RELX PLC has no employees and Executive Directors 
are the only employees of RELX Group PLC. We therefore have 
no data to report but have chosen to continue to report data on 
changes in base salary of the CEO compared with changes in base 
salary of a broader employee population. The salary increase for 
the CEO of 2.5% was below the average increase for the broader 
UK and US workforce, and significantly below the increases for 
our lower paid employees. 

UK pay ratios
The UK Regulations require the disclosure of the ratio of total 
CEO remuneration to median (P50), 25th percentile (P25) and 75th 
percentile (P75) UK employee total remuneration (calculated on 
a full-time equivalent basis). UK employees represent less than 
20% of our global employee population. 

Pay ratios for total remuneration are likely to vary, potentially 
significantly, over time, since the CEO’s total remuneration each 
year is driven largely by performance-related pay outcomes and is 
affected by share price movements. We have therefore also shown 
the UK ratios for the salary component. 

For the purposes of the ratios below, the CEO’s 2023 total 
remuneration is the total single figure and salary as disclosed  
on page 130. The P25, P50 and P75 were selected from the UK 
employee population as at 1 October 2023. Ratios for prior 
years are as disclosed in the respective reports.

Slight differences compared with ratios calculated using data 
shown in the tables are due to rounding.

The ratios are calculated using Option A, meaning that the 
median, 25th and 75th percentiles were determined based on total 
remuneration using the single total figure valuation methodology, 
except for annual incentives (other than sales incentives) which 
are based on estimated payout as individual final payout levels 
are still to be finalised.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Implementation of remuneration policy in 2024
Salary: The Committee has awarded a salary increase of 2.5% to 
each Executive Director, which means that, from 1 January 2024, 
Erik Engstrom’s salary rose to £1,412,974 and Nick Luff’s salary 
to £832,055. 

Benefits: The benefits provided to the Executive Directors are 
unchanged for 2024.

Annual incentive: The AIP payout at target performance is 135% 
of base salary and the maximum 200% of base salary, with 50% 
of the AIP earned deferred into shares. Revenue, adjusted net 
profit after tax and cash flow each have a weight of 30% and 
non-financial a weight of 10%. Non-financial measures are 
focused on sustainability metrics. Details of the 2024 annual 
financial targets and non-financial metrics will be disclosed in 
the 2024 Remuneration Report.

Pension: Erik Engstrom and Nick Luff will receive cash in lieu of 
pension of 11% of their salary. 

Share based awards: As in 2023, we will be granting LTIP awards 
with face values of 450% of salary to Erik Engstrom and 375% 
to Nick Luff in 2024. The awards are subject to a three-year 
performance period and the net (after tax) vested shares are 
to be retained for a further two-year holding period. As highlighted 
earlier, the level of vesting for threshold performance is reduced 
to 20%.

The following metrics, weightings, targets and vesting scales 
apply to LTIP awards granted in 2024 for the 2024–2026 cycle.

The vesting of LTIP awards is dependent on three separate 
performance measures: ROIC, EPS and TSR weighted 
40%:40%:20% respectively and assessed independently.

The TSR measure comprises three comparators (sterling, 
euro and US dollar) reflecting the fact that RELX accesses equity 
capital markets through three exchanges – London, Amsterdam 
and New York – in three currency zones. RELX’s TSR performance 
is measured separately against each comparator group and 
each ranking achieved will produce a payout, if any, in respect 
of one-third of the TSR measure. The proportion of the TSR 
measure that vests will be the sum of the three payouts.

The averaging period applied for TSR measurement purposes is 
the three months before the start of the financial year in which the 
award is granted and the last three months of the third financial 
year of the performance period.

The companies for the TSR comparator groups for the 2024–2026 
LTIP cycle were selected on the following basis (substantially 
unchanged from prior year):

(a)   they were in a relevant market index or were the largest 

listed companies on the relevant exchanges at the end of the 
year before the start of the performance period: the FTSE 100 
for the sterling group; the Euronext100 and Dax40 for the euro 
group; and the S&P 500 for the US dollar group;

(b)  certain companies were then excluded:

	§ those with mainly domestic or single country revenues 

(as they do not reflect the global nature of RELX’s 
customer base);

	§ those engaged in extractive industries (as they are 

exposed to commodity cycles); and

	§ financial services companies (as they have a different 

risk/reward profile).

(c)   the remaining companies were then ranked by market 
capitalisation and, for each comparator group, around 
50 companies with market capitalisations above and 
below that of RELX were taken; and 

(d)   relevant listed global peers operating in businesses similar 
to those of RELX, but not otherwise included, were added.

ANNUAL BASE SALARY

Purpose and link to strategy
To recruit and retain the best executive talent globally to execute our strategic objectives at appropriate cost.
Operation
Salaries for Executive Directors are set and reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) with changes typically 
taking effect on 1 January. In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may review salaries more frequently.

When reviewing salaries, the Committee considers the executive’s role and sustained value to the Company in terms of skill, experience 
and overall contribution and the Company’s guidelines for salaries for all employees for the year. Periodically, competitiveness with 
companies which are comparable in respect of industry, size, international scope and complexity is also considered in order to ensure 
the Company’s ability to attract and retain executives.

Performance framework
N/A
Maximum value
Salary increases will continue to be aligned with the range of increases for the wider employee population and subject to annual 
all-employee guidelines. However, as for all employees, the Committee has discretion to exceed this to take account of individual 
circumstances such as change in responsibility, increases in scale or complexity of the business or alignment to market level.
Recovery of sums paid
No provision.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Purpose and link to strategy
Retirement plans are part of remuneration packages designed to recruit and retain the best executive talent at appropriate cost.
Operation
Executive Directors receive pension benefits up to the value equivalent to the maximum level of pension benefits provided under the 
Company’s regular defined contribution pension plans as may be in effect or amended from time to time (currently 11% of base salary  
in the UK). The defined contribution pension plans are designed to be competitive and sustainable long-term. Any amount payable may 
be paid wholly or partly as cash in lieu. 
Performance framework

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Directors’ Remuneration Report

143

Set out in this section is the Company’s Remuneration Policy for Directors, as approved by shareholders at the 20 April 2023 Annual 

General Meeting, and which is intended to apply for three years from the AGM and to awards granted from the first quarter of 2024. 

OTHER BENEFITS
Purpose and link to strategy
To provide competitive benefits at appropriate cost.

Operation
Other benefits, subject to periodic review, may include private medical and dental cover, life assurance, tax return preparation costs, 
car benefits, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, relocation benefits and expatriate allowances and other benefits available to 
employees generally, including, where appropriate, the tax on such benefits.
Performance framework
N/A
Maximum value
The maximum for ongoing benefits for Executive Directors will not normally exceed 10% of salary (excluding any one-off items,  
such as immigration support or relocation benefits, and any tax related charge on benefits which is met by the Company). However,  
the Committee may provide reasonable benefits beyond this amount in exceptional situations, such as a change in the individual’s 
circumstances caused by the Company, or if there is a significant increase in the cost of providing the agreed benefit.

ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN (AIP)
Purpose and link to strategy
The annual incentive provides focus on the delivery of annual financial targets and the achievement of annual objectives and milestones 
which are chosen to align with the Company’s strategy and create a platform for sustainable future performance. The compulsory 
deferral of 50% of any annual incentive earned into RELX shares for three years promotes longer-term alignment of Executive Directors’ 
interests with shareholders’ interests, including an element of post-termination shareholding.
Why performance measures are chosen and how targets are set
Performance measures include a balanced set of financial measures which are appropriately weighted and which support current 
strategy and incentivise the Executive Directors to achieve the desired outcomes without undue risk of focusing on any one financial 
measure. The financial targets are designed to be challenging and are set with reference to the previous year’s performance and 
internal and external forecasts for the following year.

Performance measures may also include non-financial measures, for example linked to sustainability.
Operation
The Committee reviews and sets the financial targets and, if applicable, non-financial targets, annually, taking into account internal 
forecasts and strategic plans. Following year end, the Committee compares actual performance with the financial targets and assesses 
the achievement of any non-financial targets. The targets and outcomes are fully disclosed in the Remuneration Report published after 
year end.

50% of any annual incentive earned is paid in cash to the Executive Director and the remaining 50% is deferred into RELX shares, which 
are released to the Executive Director after three years. Dividend equivalents accrued during the deferral period are payable in respect 
of the shares. On a change in control, the default position is that deferred shares are released to the Executive Director. Alternatively, 
the Committee may determine that deferred shares will instead be exchanged for equivalent share awards in the acquiring company.
Performance framework
The AIP includes financial measures with a weighting of at least 85% and may also include non-financial measures with a weighting of up 
to 15%. Each measure is assessed separately.

	§ The minimum payout is zero.
	§ Each measure is assessed independently and payout for each measure at threshold is 10% of the maximum opportunity for that 

measure. 

	§ Payout for target performance is 135% of salary.

Following an assessment of financial achievement, and scoring of any non-financial measures, the Committee agrees the overall level 
of earned incentive for each Executive Director.

Committee discretion applies.1,2,3
Maximum value
The maximum potential annual incentive is 200% of annual base salary. This includes the deferred share element but excludes dividend 
equivalents payable in respect of the deferred shares.
Recovery of sums paid
Clawback applies.4

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
Purpose and link to strategy
The Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is designed to provide a long-term incentive for Executive Directors to achieve the key performance 
measures that support the Company’s strategy, and to align their interests with shareholders.
Why performance measures are chosen and how targets are set
Our strategic focus is on continuing to transform the core business through organic investment and the build-out of new products into 
adjacent markets and geographies, supplemented by selective portfolio acquisitions and divestments. The performance measures in 
the LTIP are chosen to support this strategy by focusing on sustained earnings growth, return on invested capital and shareholder return.

Targets are set with regard to previous results and internal and external forecasts for the performance period and the strategic plan for 
the business. They are designed to provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance, whilst allowing a reasonable expectation 
that reward at the lower end of the scale is attainable, subject to robust performance.
Operation
Annual awards of performance shares, with vesting subject to:

	§ performance measured over three financial years
	§ continued employment (subject to the provisions set out in the Policy on payments for loss of office section)
	§ meeting shareholding requirements (450% of salary for the CEO and 300% of salary for the CFO)

Executive Directors are to retain their net (after tax) vested shares for a holding period of two years after vesting. Dividend equivalents 
accrued during the performance period are payable in respect of the performance shares that vest.

On a change of control, the default position is that awards vest on a pro-rated basis, subject to an assessment of performance against 
targets at that time. Alternatively, the Committee may determine that the awards will not vest and will instead be exchanged for 
equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
Performance framework
The performance measures are EPS, ROIC and relative TSR, weighted 40%:40%:20% respectively and assessed independently, 
such that a payout can be received under any one of the measures (or, for TSR, in respect of one of the three comparator groups).

	§ The minimum payout is zero.
	§ Each measure is assessed independently and payout for each measure at threshold is 20% of the maximum opportunity for  

that measure. 

	§ Payout in line with expectations is 50% of the maximum award.

Dividend equivalents are not taken into account in the above payout levels. 

Committee discretion applies.1,2,3
Maximum value
The maximum grant in any year is up to 450% of base salary for the CEO and up to 375% of base salary for other Executive Directors 
(not including dividend equivalents).
Recovery of sums paid
Clawback applies.4

Notes to the Remuneration policy table 
(1) 

 Discretion in respect of AIP and LTIP payout levels: In determining the level of payout under the AIP and vesting under the LTIP, the 
Committee takes into account RELX’s overall business performance and value created for shareholders over the period in review 
and other relevant factors. It has discretion to adjust the vesting and payout levels (subject always to the maximum individual limits)  
if it believes this would result in a fairer outcome. This discretion will only be used in exceptional circumstances and the Committee will 
explain in the next Remuneration Report the extent to which it has been exercised and the reasons for doing so.

 Discretion to vary performance measures under the AIP and the LTIP: The Committee may vary the financial measures applying to a 
current annual incentive year and performance measures for LTIP awards already granted if a change in circumstances leads it to believe 
that the arrangement is no longer a fair measure of performance. Any new measures will not be materially less, or more, challenging than 
the original ones. 
 Discretion on termination of employment under the AIP and the LTIP: The Committee’s discretion on termination of employment is 
described under the ‘Policy on payments for loss of office’ section.
 Malus and clawback under the AIP and the LTIP: Under the AIP and the LTIP, the Committee has discretion to apply malus and clawback in 
case of material misstatement of results or erroneous calculation in incentive payout; breach of post-termination restrictive covenants; 
misconduct; fraud or conduct which results in (i) significant reputational damage; (ii) material adverse effect on the financial position of the 
Company; or (iii) corporate failure. These apply for three years following the AIP cash payment and five years from the start of each LTIP 
performance period and, in the case of a breach of restrictive covenants, to the end of the restriction period. If a participant is subject to an 
internal investigation regarding a serious breach of any of the above matters, the vesting of their awards and the application of malus and 
clawback may be delayed until the outcome of that investigation.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)

Purpose and link to strategy

The Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is designed to provide a long-term incentive for Executive Directors to achieve the key performance 

measures that support the Company’s strategy, and to align their interests with shareholders.

Why performance measures are chosen and how targets are set

Our strategic focus is on continuing to transform the core business through organic investment and the build-out of new products into 

adjacent markets and geographies, supplemented by selective portfolio acquisitions and divestments. The performance measures in 

the LTIP are chosen to support this strategy by focusing on sustained earnings growth, return on invested capital and shareholder return.

Targets are set with regard to previous results and internal and external forecasts for the performance period and the strategic plan for 

the business. They are designed to provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance, whilst allowing a reasonable expectation 

that reward at the lower end of the scale is attainable, subject to robust performance.

Operation

Annual awards of performance shares, with vesting subject to:

	§ performance measured over three financial years

	§ continued employment (subject to the provisions set out in the Policy on payments for loss of office section)

	§ meeting shareholding requirements (450% of salary for the CEO and 300% of salary for the CFO)

Executive Directors are to retain their net (after tax) vested shares for a holding period of two years after vesting. Dividend equivalents 

accrued during the performance period are payable in respect of the performance shares that vest.

On a change of control, the default position is that awards vest on a pro-rated basis, subject to an assessment of performance against 

targets at that time. Alternatively, the Committee may determine that the awards will not vest and will instead be exchanged for 

equivalent awards in the acquiring company.

Performance framework

The performance measures are EPS, ROIC and relative TSR, weighted 40%:40%:20% respectively and assessed independently, 

such that a payout can be received under any one of the measures (or, for TSR, in respect of one of the three comparator groups).

	§ The minimum payout is zero.

	§ Each measure is assessed independently and payout for each measure at threshold is 20% of the maximum opportunity for  

that measure. 

	§ Payout in line with expectations is 50% of the maximum award.

Dividend equivalents are not taken into account in the above payout levels. 

The maximum grant in any year is up to 450% of base salary for the CEO and up to 375% of base salary for other Executive Directors 

Committee discretion applies.1,2,3

Notes to the Remuneration policy table 

(1) 

 Discretion in respect of AIP and LTIP payout levels: In determining the level of payout under the AIP and vesting under the LTIP, the 

Committee takes into account RELX’s overall business performance and value created for shareholders over the period in review 

and other relevant factors. It has discretion to adjust the vesting and payout levels (subject always to the maximum individual limits)  

if it believes this would result in a fairer outcome. This discretion will only be used in exceptional circumstances and the Committee will 

explain in the next Remuneration Report the extent to which it has been exercised and the reasons for doing so.

(2) 

 Discretion to vary performance measures under the AIP and the LTIP: The Committee may vary the financial measures applying to a 

current annual incentive year and performance measures for LTIP awards already granted if a change in circumstances leads it to believe 

that the arrangement is no longer a fair measure of performance. Any new measures will not be materially less, or more, challenging than 

the original ones. 

(3) 

 Discretion on termination of employment under the AIP and the LTIP: The Committee’s discretion on termination of employment is 

described under the ‘Policy on payments for loss of office’ section.

(4) 

 Malus and clawback under the AIP and the LTIP: Under the AIP and the LTIP, the Committee has discretion to apply malus and clawback in 

case of material misstatement of results or erroneous calculation in incentive payout; breach of post-termination restrictive covenants; 

misconduct; fraud or conduct which results in (i) significant reputational damage; (ii) material adverse effect on the financial position of the 

Company; or (iii) corporate failure. These apply for three years following the AIP cash payment and five years from the start of each LTIP 

performance period and, in the case of a breach of restrictive covenants, to the end of the restriction period. If a participant is subject to an 

internal investigation regarding a serious breach of any of the above matters, the vesting of their awards and the application of malus and 

clawback may be delayed until the outcome of that investigation.

(5) 

 Explanation of differences between the Company’s policy on Executive Directors’ remuneration and the policy for other employees: 
A larger percentage of Executive Directors’ remuneration is performance related than that of other employees. All managers participate 
in an annual incentive plan. Participation levels, measures and targets vary according to their role, seniority and local business priorities. 
Senior executives may also participate in multi-year equity plans. Grant levels under the plans vary according to roles and seniority. 
The range and level of retirement and other benefits provided to employees vary according to local market practice.

Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios
The Committee considers the level of remuneration that may be paid in the context of the performance delivered and value added for 
shareholders. The charts below are an illustration of how the CEO’s and CFO’s regular annual remuneration could vary under different 
performance scenarios. The salary, benefits and pension levels are the same in all three scenarios in each chart and are based on 2023 
salary, benefits as shown in the 2022 Single Total Figure table and cash in lieu of pension of 11% of base salary. Annual incentive amounts 
include the portion which is subject to compulsory deferral into RELX shares for three years. The performance assumptions which 
have been used are as follows: Minimum means no AIP payout and no LTIP vesting. In line with expectations means AIP payout at 135% 
of salary (of which 50% is deferred into shares) and LTIP vesting at 50% of the award. Maximum means AIP payout at 200% of salary 
(of which 50% is deferred into shares) and LTIP vesting at 100% of the award. The three bars in each chart assume no share price 
movement. As required by the UK Regulations, assuming maximum performance achievement (as described above) and 50% share 
price growth over the performance period, the CEO’s maximum remuneration would increase to £13.7 m and the CFO’s maximum 
remuneration to £7.1m. Any dividend equivalents payable in respect of the AIP deferred shares and the LTIP are not included.

Shareholding requirement
The Executive Directors are subject to shareholding requirements. These are a minimum of 450% of annual base salary for the CEO and 
300% of annual base salary for other Executive Directors. On joining or promotion to the Board, Executive Directors are given a period of 
time, typically up to five years, to build up to their requirement. On termination of employment, Executive Directors are to maintain their 
full shareholding requirement (or, if lower, their actual level of shareholding at the time of leaving) for two years after leaving employment.

Shares which count for shareholding purposes are shares beneficially owned by the Executive Director, their spouse, civil partner or 
dependent child and AIP deferred shares which are within their three-year deferral period, on a notional net of tax basis.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Approach to recruitment remuneration – Executive Directors
When agreeing the components of a remuneration package on the appointment of a new Executive Director, or an internal promotion 
to the Board, the Committee would seek to align the package with the remuneration policy stated in the policy table.

The Committee’s general principle on recruitment is to offer a competitive remuneration package to attract high-calibre candidates 
from a global talent pool. Basic salary would be set at an appropriate level for the candidate, taking into account all relevant factors.  
As a data analytics and technology-driven business, with over half of its revenue in the US, the Company primarily competes for talent 
with global information and technology companies.

The various components and the Company’s approach are as follows:

REMUNERATION COMPONENTS
The remuneration would include base salary, retirement benefits, other benefits, AIP and LTIP in line with the policy table, taking into 
account the principles set out above.
COMPENSATION FOR FORFEITED ENTITLEMENTS
The Committee may make awards and payments on hiring an external candidate to compensate him or her for entitlements forfeited 
on leaving the previous employer. If such a decision is made, the Committee will attempt to reflect previous entitlements as closely as 
possible using a variety of tools, including cash and share based awards. Malus and clawback provisions will apply where appropriate.  
If necessary to facilitate the grant of awards, the Committee may rely on the one person exemption from shareholder approval in the  
UK Listing Rules.
RELOCATION ALLOWANCES AND EXPENSES
The type and size of relocation allowances and expenses will be determined by the specific circumstances of the new recruit.

Policy on payments for loss of office
In line with the Company’s policy, the service contracts of the existing Executive Directors contain 12-month notice periods.

The circumstances in which an Executive Director’s employment is terminated will affect the Committee’s determination of any payment 
for loss of office, but it expects to apply the principles outlined in the table on the next page. The Committee reserves the right to depart 
from these principles where appropriate in light of any taxation requirements to which the Company or the Executive Director is subject 
(including, without limitation, section 409A of the US Internal Revenue Code), or other legal obligations.

(including, without limitation, section 409A of the US Internal Revenue Code), or other legal obligations.

Policy on payments for loss of office (continued)

GENERAL(1)

INCENTIVES

Mutually agreed termination/termination by the Company other than for cause(2)
(includes retirement with customary notice)

The Executive Director would be entitled to salary, benefits  
and other contractual payments in the normal way up to the 
termination date and would be paid for any accrued but 
untaken holiday.

Salary: Payment of up to 12 months’ salary to reflect the notice 
period or payment in lieu of notice.

Other benefits: Where possible, benefits would be continued for 
up to the duration of any unworked period of notice (not exceeding 
the maximum stated in the policy table) or the Executive Director 
would receive a cash payment (not exceeding the cost to the 
Company of providing those benefits).

Pension: Deferred or immediate pension in accordance with 
scheme rules, with a credit in respect of, or payment for up to, 
the full period of any unworked period of notice. There is provision 
under the defined benefit pension scheme for members leaving 
Company service by reason of permanent incapacity to make  
an application to the scheme trustee for early payment of  
their pension.

Other: The Company may pay compensation in respect of any 
statutory employment rights and may make other appropriate 
and customary payments. 

The Company would have due regard to principles of mitigation 
of loss. Reductions would be applied to reflect any portion of the 
notice period that is worked and/or spent on gardening leave.

On injury, disability, ill-health or death, the Committee reserves 
the right to vary the treatment outlined in this section.

Employee instigated resignation
The Executive Director would not receive any payments for 
loss of office. The Executive Director would be entitled to salary, 
benefits and other contractual payments in the normal way up 
to the termination date and would be paid for any accrued but 
untaken holiday.

Pension: A deferred or immediate pension would be payable 
in accordance with the scheme rules.

Dismissal for cause
The Executive Director would be entitled to salary, benefits 
and other contractual payments in the normal way up to the 
termination date and would be paid for any accrued but untaken 
holiday but would not receive any payments for loss of office. 

Pension: A deferred or immediate pension would be payable 
in accordance with the scheme rules.

Annual incentive: Any unpaid annual incentive for the previous year 
and a pro-rata payment in respect of the part of the financial year 
up to the termination date would generally be payable (subject 
to the deferral provisions), with the amount being determined 
by reference to the original performance criteria. However, the 
Committee has discretion to decide otherwise depending on 
the reason for termination and other specific circumstances. 
The Company would not pay any annual incentive in respect of any 
part of the financial year following the termination date (e.g. for 
any unworked period of notice). AIP deferred shares would be 
released to the Executive Directors in full at the end of the deferral 
period. The annual incentive clawback provisions would apply. 

LTIP: The default position is that unvested LTIP awards would be 
pro-rated to reflect time employed and would vest subject to 
performance measured at the end of the relevant performance 
period and subject to the Executive Director continuing to 
meet their full shareholding requirement for two years after the 
termination date. The Committee has discretion to allow unvested 
LTIP awards to vest earlier and to adjust the application of time 
pro-rating and performance conditions, subject to the plan rules. 
The requirement to retain net (after tax) vested LTIP shares for 
a holding period of two years after vesting ceases to apply on 
termination of employment.

Annual incentive: The Executive Director would be entitled to 
receive an annual incentive for a completed previous year (subject 
to the deferral provisions), but not a pro-rated annual incentive 
in respect of a part year up to the termination date, unless the 
Committee decides otherwise in the specific circumstances. Any 
AIP deferred shares would be released to the Executive Director 
in full at the end of the deferral period. Annual incentive clawback 
provisions would apply. 

LTIP: All outstanding LTIP awards would lapse on the date of notice.
Annual incentive: The Executive Director would not receive any 
unpaid annual incentive. Any AIP deferred shares lapse on the  
date of dismissal.

LTIP: All outstanding LTIP awards would lapse on the date  
of dismissal.

(1)   In addition to what is set out in this section, on termination for any reason, Erik Engstrom will be entitled to payment of amounts held in his ‘Retirement Account’. 
(2)   In cases where the approved leaver treatment applies, the AIP and LTIP have a default position as well as giving the Committee discretion to adjust the default treatment 
within certain parameters. The Committee would only expect to exercise such discretion where the Committee believes the personal circumstances of the Executive 
Director so require.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Remuneration policy table – Non-Executive Directors

FEES
Purpose and link to strategy
To enable RELX to recruit Non-Executive Directors with the right balance of personal skills and experience to make a major contribution 
to the Board and Committees of a global business which is listed in London, Amsterdam and New York.
Operation
RELX Chair: Receives an aggregate annual fee with no additional fees, for example, Committee Chair fees. The Committee determines 
the Chair’s fee on the advice of the Senior Independent Director. 

Other Non-Executive Directors: Receive an annual fee with additional fees payable as appropriate for specific roles and duties. 
These additional fees include fees for the Senior Independent Director and Committee Chairs, for membership of Board Committees, 
as well as a workforce engagement fee and international travel fees. In future, other fees may be payable, for example attendance fees. 
The Board determines the level of fees, subject to applicable law.

Fees may be reviewed annually, although in practice they have changed on a less frequent basis. When reviewing fees, consideration is 
given to the time commitment required, the complexity of the role and the calibre of the individual. Periodically, comparative market data 
is also reviewed, the primary source for which is the practice of FTSE 30 companies.
Maximum value
The aggregate annual fee limit for fees paid to the Chair and the Non-Executive Directors is £2m. Additional fees for membership of or 
chairing Board Committees and assuming additional responsibilities such as acting as Senior Independent Director, are not subject to 
this maximum limit.

OTHER BENEFITS
Purpose and link to strategy
To provide competitive benefits at appropriate cost.
Operation
Other benefits for Non-Executive Directors are reviewed periodically and may include private medical cover, tax return preparation 
costs, secretarial benefits, car benefits, travel and related subsistence costs, including, where appropriate, the tax on such benefits.
Maximum value
There is no prescribed maximum amount.

Approach to recruitment remuneration – Non-Executive 
Directors
Following recruitment, a new Non-Executive Director will 
be entitled to fees and other benefits in accordance with the 
Company’s remuneration policy. No additional remuneration 
is paid on recruitment. However, any reasonable expenses 
incurred during the recruitment process will be reimbursed.

Policy on payments for loss of office – Non-Executive Directors 
In addition to unpaid accrued fees, the Non-Executive Directors 
are entitled to receive one month’s fees for loss of office if their 
appointment is terminated before the end of its term.

Service contracts and letters of appointment
There are no further obligations in the Directors’ service contracts 
and letters of appointment which are not otherwise disclosed in 
this Report which could give rise to a remuneration payment or 
loss of office payment. All Directors’ service contracts and letters 
of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office. The Executive Directors’ service contracts do 
not have a fixed expiry date.

Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Company 
When the Committee reviews the Executive Directors’ salaries 
annually, it takes into account the Company’s guidelines for 
salaries for all employees in the Company’s major operating 
locations for the forthcoming year. The Committee also considers 
market practice in the FTSE 30 as well as pay practices of other 
global information and technology companies when determining 
the quantum and structure of Directors’ pay.

The Committee annually reviews various aspects of workforce 
remuneration and related policies in order to deepen its 
understanding of pay structures throughout the organisation.

Our designated Non-Executive Director responsible for workforce 
engagement meets with employees representing our global 
employee population in order to understand a wide range of 
employee views on a variety of topics. The feedback is reported 
back to the Board at least once per year and forms part of the 
Board’s discussions and decision making. As part of this process, 
the Non-Executive Director explains how executive remuneration 
aligns with wider pay policy.

Consideration of shareholder views
Our practice is to consult shareholders and consider their views 
when formulating, or changing, our policy. The Committee took 
into account feedback received from shareholders since the prior 
policy was approved when reviewing the current policy. 

Previous remuneration policies and prior commitments
Any payments which are still to be made under arrangements 
made and awards granted under previous remuneration policies 
will be made consistent with the applicable policy. The provisions 
of the previous policies which relate to arrangements and awards 
granted under those previous policies will therefore continue to 
apply until all payments in relation to those arrangements and 
awards have been made. The Committee also reserves the right  
to make any remuneration or loss of office payments if the terms 
were agreed prior to the approval of the 2013 or 2016 policy or 
prior to an individual being appointed as a Director.

Minor amendments
The Committee may make minor amendments for regulatory, 
tax or administrative purpose.

Minor amendments

The Committee may make minor amendments for regulatory,

and estimation. The discount rate, inflation rate and mortality assumptions may have a material effect  
in determining the defined benefit pension obligation and costs which are reported in the financial statements. 
The Committee received and discussed regular reports from the Group Financial Controller on the 
methodology and the basis of the assumptions used.   

The Committee discussed and challenged management’s assessment and was satisfied that all judgements  
and estimations had been appropriately made and the financial statement disclosures were appropriate.

Committee meetings are typically attended by the Board Chair, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Group Financial Controller, the Chief Legal Officer, the Head of 
Internal Audit & Assurance (IAA), and audit partners from the 
external auditors. 

External audit effectiveness and independence 
The Group has a well-established policy on audit effectiveness 
and independence of auditors that sets out among other things: 
the responsibilities of the Audit Committee in the selection of 
auditors to be proposed for appointment or re-appointment 
and for agreement on the terms of their engagement, scope 
and remuneration; the auditor independence requirements and 
the policy on the provision of non-audit services; the rotation of 
audit partners and staff; and the conduct of meetings between 
the auditors and the Audit Committee. 

The Committee’s policy on the use of the external auditor to 
provide non-audit services is in accordance with applicable 
laws and takes into account the relevant ethical guidance for 
auditors. Any permissible non-audit services must be pre-
approved by the Chief Financial Officer and above £50,000,  
by the Chair of the Audit Committee. All non-audit services 
provided and fees are presented to the Committee on a  
regular basis. 

The policy is available on the website, 

 www.relx.com. 

The Committee has conducted its review of the performance  
of the external auditors and effectiveness of the external  
audit process for the year ended 31 December 2023.  
The review included: 

  an assessment of the quality of the auditor’s reporting to 

and interaction with the Audit Committee 

  review of the completion of the audit plan and changes to 

risks identified or work performed 

  a discussion with EY on data analytics tools used in the audit; 
  consideration of public reports by regulatory authorities on 
key EY member firms and their view on the effectiveness of 
EY’s audits 

  a survey of key stakeholders across RELX evaluating the 

performance of each audit team 

The Audit Committee holds private meetings with the  
external auditor to encourage open and transparent feedback. 
The Chair of the Committee also met with the external auditors 
outside of Committee meetings supporting effective and  
timely communication. 

Based on this review, the Audit Committee was satisfied with 
the performance of the auditors and the effectiveness of the 
audit process. The external auditors have confirmed their 
independence and compliance with the policy on auditor 
independence to the Audit Committee.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

RELX   Annual Report 2023  |  Governance 

Non-audit services 
The external auditors are precluded from engaging in non-audit 
services that would compromise their independence or violate 
any professional requirements or regulations affecting their 
appointment as auditors. The auditors may, however, provide 
non-audit services which do not conflict with their independence. 

The Committee has reviewed and agreed the non-audit services 
provided in 2023 together with the associated fees. The non-
audit services provided in 2023 were very limited and, in line 
with the latest FRC guidance, linked to audit work such as a 
bond issue and corporate responsibility data assurance. 

The total fees payable to EY for the year ended 31 December 
2023 were £9.1m of which £0.7m related to non-audit work. 
Further details are provided in note 4 to the financial statements. 

The non-audit fees remain below the 70% threshold as per the 
most recent FRC guidance. 

Auditor appointment 
EY were first appointed auditor of RELX PLC for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2016. The auditor is required to rotate 
the lead audit partner responsible for the engagement every  
five years. The year ended 31 December 2023 was the third year 
for the lead audit partner, Colin Brown. The Audit Committee 
confirms that they were in compliance with the provisions of  
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 during the 
financial year ended 31 December 2023. In accordance with  
the terms of this Order, RELX anticipates that it will conduct  
a competitive tender process during 2024 with respect to the 
audit for the year ended 31 December 2026. The Committee 
believes this approach is in the best interests of shareholders 
and will provide sufficient time to allow for an orderly transition 
in the event of a change in auditor.  

Having considered the summary set out above relating to the 
effectiveness and independence of EY, the Committee was 
satisfied and has recommended to the Board that a Resolution 
to re-appoint EY as auditors for the year ending 31 December 
2024 be proposed at the 2024 AGM which the Board has 
accepted and endorsed. 

Internal audit 
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference requires an annual 
review of internal audit effectiveness. RELX has an established 
Internal Audit function governed by a formal charter which 
requires an external assessment at least once every five years 
to consider and report on conformance with the Institute of 
Internal Auditors International Professional Practices 
Framework (IPPF) and UK Chartered Institute of Internal 
Auditors Internal Audit Code of Practice (CoP). 

An external assessment of internal audit was carried out in 
2022. The assessment identified areas of enhancement related 
to strategy, planning, operational excellence, and talent.  
All recommendations have been implemented.     

The Audit Committee annually receives and considers a report 
from the Head of IAA on: the independence of the internal audit 
activity; a review of the IAA Charter; conformance with the 
mandatory elements of the IPPF and CoP; and the results  
of its quality assurance and improvement programme. 

Audit Committee effectiveness 
The effectiveness of the Audit Committee was reviewed as part 
of the 2023 evaluation of the Board which confirmed that the 
Committee continues to function effectively. Details of the 
evaluation are set out on page 112.

RELX  Annual Report 2023 | Governance

Authority to purchase own shares
At the Company’s 2023 AGM, shareholders passed a resolution 
authorising the purchase of up to 193,584,144 ordinary shares  
in the Company (representing approximately 10% of the issued 
ordinary shares) by way of market purchase. This authority  
will expire at the 2024 AGM, when a resolution to renew  
the authority to purchase Company shares will be submitted  
to shareholders. During the year, 30,912,126 ordinary shares  
of 14 51⁄116 p each (representing 1.6% of the ordinary shares in issue 
at 31 December 2023) were purchased by the Company for a total 
consideration of £800m, including expenses, and subsequently 
transferred to be held in treasury. A further 4,627,481 shares were 
purchased between 2 January 2024 and the date of this report.  
On 7 December 2023, the Company cancelled 31m ordinary shares 
held in treasury. Therefore, as at 31 December 2023 there were 
19,712,193 ordinary shares held in treasury, representing 1% of  
the ordinary shares in issue. The purpose of the share buyback 
programme is to reduce the capital of the Company.

Share issuance
At the 2023 AGM, shareholders passed a resolution authorising 
the Directors to issue shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis 
up to a nominal value of £13,784,103, representing approximately 
5% of the Company’s issued share capital, and authorising the 
Directors to issue up to an additional 5% of the issued share  
capital for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis in connection with  
an acquisition or specified investment. Since the 2023 AGM, no 
shares have been issued under this authority. The shareholder 
authority also permits the Directors to issue shares in order to 
satisfy entitlements under employee share plans and details of 
such allotments are described below.

During the year, 3,027,517 ordinary shares in the Company were 
issued in order to satisfy entitlements under employee share 
plans as follows: 669,028 under the UK SAYE Share Option Scheme 
at prices between 1,178p and 1,976p per share; 153,166 under the 
legacy Dutch Debenture Scheme at prices between 9.561 EUR and 
19.39 EUR , which is satisfied by way of Company shares; and 
2,205,323 under executive share option schemes at prices 
between 734.5p and 2,492p per share.

As at 31 December 2023, the Employee Benefit Trust trustee  
held an interest in 5,663,529 ordinary shares in the Company,

The next AGM of the Company will be held at 9.30 am on Thursday,

Auditor reappointment
Resolutions for the re-appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as 
auditor of the Company and to authorise the Audit Committee,  
on behalf of the Board, to determine the external auditor’s 
remuneration, will be put to shareholders at the Company’s  
2024 AGM.

Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the directors in office as at the date of this Annual Report 
confirms that:

	§ so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 

information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and

	§ he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken 
as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
have prepared consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with International Accounting Standards (IAS) in conformity with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Directors 
have elected to prepare the individual Company financial 
statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 

Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit 
or loss of the Company and of the Group for that period.

In preparing the individual Company’s financial statements,  
the Directors are required to: 

	§ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 

consistently;

	§ make judgements and accounting estimates that are 

reasonable and prudent; 

	§ state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework has been followed, subject to any 
material departures being disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and

	§ prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.

In preparing the Group financial statements, IAS 1 requires  
that Directors: 

	§ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 

consistently; 

	§ properly select and apply accounting policies; present 
information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;

	§ provide additional disclosures when compliance  

with the specific requirements of IFRS are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions or other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance; and

	§ make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as 

a going concern.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the Annual Report and financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

The Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic report, 
Directors’ report, Annual report on remuneration, and Corporate 
governance report in compliance with applicable  
laws and regulations. The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Each of the Directors confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:

	§ the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with UK-adopted IAS in conformity with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group;

	§ the individual Company financial statements, prepared in 

accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101), gives a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company;

	§ the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal and emerging risks 
and uncertainties that it faces; and

	§ the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy.
