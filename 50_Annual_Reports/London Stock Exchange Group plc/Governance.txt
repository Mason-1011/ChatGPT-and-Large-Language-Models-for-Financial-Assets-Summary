Corporate governance  
introduction

The Board is responsible for the 
long-term sustainable success  
of the Company, generating value 
for shareholders and contributing 
to wider society.

Don Robert 
Chair

Dear Shareholders, 

I am very pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2023. This report provides an overview  
of how LSEG is governed, the activities of the Board and the control 
structures we have in place. The Board is responsible for the long-term 
sustainable success of the Company, generating value for shareholders 
and contributing to wider society. The Board does this by supporting 
and challenging executive management to ensure we operate to high 
governance standards. This report explains how we seek to achieve 
this. It also contains some highlights from my perspective as Chair. 

Together with the reports of the Committees, we have set out how the 
UK Corporate Governance Code has been applied in the year. At the 
heart of the Code is a set of principles that emphasise the value of  
good corporate governance to long-term sustainable success. 

Board composition and diversity 
On 1 February 2023, Scott Guthrie joined the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director in connection with the strategic partnership with Microsoft. Scott 
has worked at Microsoft for over 25 years and currently holds position 
as Executive Vice President, Cloud and AI Group. Further information on 
the strategic partnership with Microsoft can be found on page 18 and 19. 

In accordance with the terms of the Relationship Agreement, Erin Brown, 
representative of Thomson Reuters, stepped down from the Board  
on 17 March 2023, and Doug Steenland, representative of Blackstone, 
stepped down from the Board on 20 September 2023. On behalf  
of the Board, I would like to thank Erin and Doug for the significant 
contributions they made since the acquisition of Refinitiv in January 2021.

On 14 September 2023, William Vereker took over from Cressida Hogg 
as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. Cressida Hogg continues  
to serve as Senior Independent Director and a member of the 
Remuneration Committee. I would like to thank Cressida for her 
contribution as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 

On 20 November 2023, the Group announced that it had appointed 
Michel-Alain Proch as CFO and Executive Director from 1 March 2024. 
This followed the announcement in May 2023 that Anna Manz would 
step down from the Board as CFO and Executive Director. I would like  
to thank Anna for the key role she has played in the successful delivery 
of the Group’s strategy over the last three years, and I am happy to 
welcome Michel-Alain to the Board.

The Board continues to seek opportunities to refresh the key skills and 
experience and to enhance the effectiveness of the Board, while having 
regard to board diversity. The Board believes that diversity of thought, 
experience and background makes us more dynamic, fosters innovation 
and boosts performance. The Board seeks to comply with Listing Rule 
9.8.6(9) on gender and ethnic diversity. I am pleased to confirm that  
we meet the Parker Review recommendations, and that we meet all 
recommendations set out by the FTSE Women Leaders Review. Two of 
the four senior positions in the Company outlined in the Listing Rules  
are currently held by women and two of the Board’s Directors are from  
a minority ethnic background. At the end of 2023, the Board was over 
40% female, however, following Anna’s departure and Michel-Alain’s 
arrival, this will drop to below 40%. For more information on Board 
diversity and the process followed in relation to Board appointments, 
please see the Nomination Committee report on pages 106 to 108.

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018  
(the “Code”) 
The Company has complied with the principles of the Code throughout 
the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and to the date of this 
report, and complied with all provisions of the Code, except for provision 
32. Provision 32 of the Code states that the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee should have served on a remuneration committee for at least 
12 months before becoming chair. William Vereker was appointed as 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee having served for over 11 months 
on the Committee. The decision to appoint William as Committee Chair 
shortly before 12 months on the Committee was taken in order to allow 
William to lead on the proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy, 
including consultation with shareholders. Further information on 
compliance with the Code is detailed on page 105. 

This report is intended to give shareholders a clear and comprehensive 
picture of the Group’s governance arrangements and how they 
operated during the year. Pages 98 to 105 set out details of the areas  
of our focus during the year, followed by the Committee reports. 

Conclusion 
I hope you find this report helpful and informative in understanding 
governance at LSEG. I encourage all shareholders to vote their shares in 
favour of all resolutions to be considered at our AGM in April 2024, even 
if you are unable to attend in person. Details of the AGM will be included 
in the Notice of Meeting. 

Don Robert
Chair

Corporate governance introduction continued

Remuneration Policy 
Our proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be put to shareholders 
for approval at the 2024 AGM. The proposed changes are focused  
on updating our policy to ensure that it remains appropriate for  
our transformed business. Details of the proposed policy and the 
implementation of the current policy during the year, can be found  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 117 to 153. 

Board effectiveness review 
This year’s effectiveness review was conducted by the Group Company 
Secretary using a detailed questionnaire provided with the aid of an 
external provider, Lintstock. Results and agreed areas of focus for  
the Board are described on page 102 and 103. The Board will ensure 
that these focus areas are acted upon to further improve Board 
performance. I can confirm that the actions from the 2022 effectiveness 
review have been completed.

Board site visits and workforce engagement 
Opportunities to visit our operations globally, engage directly with the 
workforce and learn about the business continue to be very important 
and valuable for the Board. During the year, the Board visited the Paris 
office and met with colleagues to hear more about their areas of the 
business and provided a forum for colleagues to share their views with 
the Board. Further information on workforce engagement can be found 
on page 71. 

The Board also engaged with the workforce virtually through a series  
of Board conversations in key regional locations. These meetings were 
designed to increase Board members’ visibility with the workforce, gain 
real insights into the Group’s culture and any concerns from colleagues 
at different levels of the business and have meaningful, two-way 
dialogue with the workforce. This was particularly important in 2023 as 
we continued with the integration of the Refinitiv business, progressed 
the partnership with Microsoft and embedded the Company’s culture 
and new values across the Group. More information of the Company’s 
culture and values can be found on page 60. The feedback that Board 
members received from this direct engagement was shared with the 
wider Board at the following meeting and the Board has encouraged 
management to respond to feedback and to take appropriate action. 
Further information can be found on pages 71 and 72. 

Committee governance 
The Chairs of the Audit Committee, Risk Committee, Nomination 
Committee and Remuneration Committee report on the activities of  
each of the Committees during the year. I would like to thank the 
Committee Chairs for the work they have done during the year,  
including attending the AGM to meet with shareholders. 

Sustainability
As described in the Sustainability section of the Strategic Report  
(pages 58 to 68), LSEG has many initiatives in place to deliver our 
commitment to be a strategic enabler of sustainable economic growth. 
Given our central role in capital markets, our global footprint and 
presence throughout the trade lifecycle, LSEG is uniquely positioned  
to play a leading role in this respect.

LSEG’s role in sustainability, and tackling climate change in particular,  
is very important to the Board, as well as the Group’s shareholders, 
employees, customers and regulators. The Board is committed to 
meeting the expectations of our shareholders and stakeholders in  
this regard.

Board responsibilities 
The LSEG Board is collectively responsible for the long-term, 
sustainable success of the Company, the delivery of sustainable value  
to its shareholders and contributing to wider society. 

The Board: 
 — provides leadership of the Company and is responsible for setting  

the strategy and maintaining high standards of governance; 

 — leads the development of the Group’s culture, values and behaviours;
 — oversees the execution of the Group’s strategy and holds executive 

management to account for its delivery; 

 — ensures necessary resources are in place for the Group to be able  
to meet its objectives and measures performance against these.  
This includes the establishment of a framework of prudent and 
effective controls, which enable risk to be assessed and managed; 
 — reviews and holds management to account for financial and business 

performance; and 

 — ensures that its responsibilities to shareholders and stakeholders  
are met, including through effective engagement. This includes 
having workforce policies and practices that are consistent with  
the Company’s values and support the Company’s long-term 
sustainable success.

In carrying out their duties, the Directors act in accordance with all 
relevant and applicable legislative and regulatory rules. In particular, 
they take into account Directors’ duties contained in the Companies Act 
2006 (the “Act”) and will consider the factors listed in Section 172 of the 
Act and any other relevant factors. 

LSEG’s Section 172(1) statement for the year ended 31 December 2023, 
including details of certain Board decisions taken during the year,  
can be found on pages 75 to 78 of the Strategic Report. 

The Directors have full access to the advice and services of the Group 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising on corporate 
governance matters. 

Board Committees 
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities to four Board 
Committees: the Audit, Nomination, Remuneration and Risk Committees. 
Full details of the Committees’ responsibilities are set out in individual 
terms of reference which are available on the corporate website.  
The work undertaken by each Committee during the financial year is 
detailed within the respective Committee reports on pages 106 to 123.

Board composition
As at the date of this report, the Board is composed of 12 members:  
the Chairman, seven independent Non-Executive Directors, two 
Non-Executive Directors (the Shareholder-appointed Director1 and the 
Director appointed in connection with the strategic partnership with 
Microsoft2), and two Executive Directors. Five of the Directors are 
women; two of the Directors are from a minority ethnic background; and 
two senior positions are held by female Directors (Senior Independent 
Director and Chief Financial Officer). The Board Diversity Policy, which  
is reviewed annually, is available on the corporate website: https://www.
lseg.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance. The Board’s statement of 
division of responsibilities can also be found on this web page.

Stakeholder engagement 
The Board seeks to understand the interests, needs and concerns  
of shareholders and other key stakeholders (including customers, the 
workforce and regulators) to enable the Company to pursue long-term 
sustainable success. For more information on how we engage with our 
stakeholders as well as how the Board has discharged its duties under 
Section 172 of the Companies Act, please see pages 69 to 78 of the 
Strategic Report. 

Relations with shareholders 
We believe that regular and ongoing engagement with our key 
stakeholders and, in particular, our shareholders is central to good 
corporate governance. The Group’s Investor Relations (IR) function, 
reporting to the Chief Financial Officer, manages a shareholder 
engagement programme throughout the year.

The Chair, Senior Independent Director and Chairs of each Board 
Committee are available to engage with major investors, typically to 
discuss corporate governance matters. In 2023, the Chair engaged  
with shareholders on matters including sustainability, remuneration  
and Board composition, as well as performance against the Company’s 
strategy. The Chair of the Remuneration Committee consulted with 
major shareholders and proxy voting agencies to understand their  
views on the proposed approach for our Remuneration Policy and key 
executive remuneration decisions. Further details and the outcome of 
this engagement are included within the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
from page 117. 

Senior management and the Investor Relations (IR) team engage with 
investors to discuss strategy, performance, sustainability and other 
matters. We continued to ramp-up investor engagement in 2023  
and demand for the stock proved to be strong, with the Blackstone 
consortium executing three successful share placings during the course 
of the year, each of which was significantly oversubscribed. In total,  
the former Refinitiv owners successfully placed over £6 billion worth of 
LSEG stock in 2023. Across the year, we held over 470 engagements 
with institutional equity and debt investors (significantly higher than the 
FTSE 100 average), with interest primarily from the UK and USA but  
with increasing interest from countries such as Canada and Australia  
as we look to broaden our outreach more globally. Senior executive 
management and the IR team took part in 9 conferences this year, 
across the US, Canada, the UK and Continental Europe, hosted by 
banks or industry organisations.

As well as expanding our conference schedule, we also ran a number  
of roadshows with executive management both internationally and in  
the UK as we continued to step up our efforts to explain our investment 
case and strategy to a wider range of prospective global investors.  
We achieved broad coverage of our existing register, meeting with  
over 85% of our active shareholder base. 

In 2022, we ran a comprehensive investor perception study through our 
external advisers, Makinson Cowell. One of the key pieces of feedback 
from that study was that investors expressed a desire for more deep 
dives into the various businesses that make up the Group and to hear 
more often from divisional management. In 2023, we held a landmark 
two-day Capital Markets Event, at which we welcomed more than 90 
institutional investors and sell-side analysts to our London headquarters. 
Hundreds more watched the plenary presentations via a live webcast. 
The guests were invited to hear presentations from our CEO, CFO, Head 
of Data & Analytics and Head of Sales & Account Management, as well 
as to take part in Q&A sessions with management teams from across 
our business in break-out sessions. Feedback on the event was very 
positive. From those who provided feedback scores, 92% of attendees 
said they found the event useful. In addition, 90% of attendees said they 
now think of LSEG more as an information services company than an 
exchange, representing the shift in LSEG’s market perception since the 
acquisition of Refinitiv.

The Board receives a report on IR matters at each of its scheduled 
meetings, including feedback from investors, market expectations  
of financial performance and updates on share register composition. 
Sell-side analyst research notes on LSEG are regularly circulated 
through the business, including to the Board and senior executives. The 
Group’s corporate brokers also provide the Board with advice on market 
sentiment, input on market communications and share register analysis. 

In addition to information on financial and operational performance,  
the Group engages with shareholders and relevant shareholder 
advisory agencies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
matters. The Group produces an annual Sustainability Report that details 
its approach to ESG matters: www.lseg.com/investor-relations/sustainability. 

Our AGM provides the opportunity for all shareholders to meet  
and to put questions to the Board of Directors. Our 2023 AGM was  
held on 27 April 2023 at Butchers’ Hall in London and provided the 
opportunity for all shareholders to meet and put questions to the  
Board of Directors.

The IR section of the Group’s website (www.lseg.com/investor-relations) 
is a primary source of regularly updated information about the Group.  
All financial reports and statements, regulatory news service 
announcements and disclosures, presentations and other relevant 
documents are available on the website, together with a list of analysts 
producing research on the Company and a summary of analysts’ 
forecasts of performance. Recognising that joining our preliminary and 
interim results conference calls is not always possible, recordings of 
these calls are accessible to all shareholders via the Group website.

Workforce engagement 
The Board believes that having a diverse workforce makes us more 
dynamic, fosters innovation and boosts performance. The Board 
continues to support the goals for senior leadership set by management 
which include goals for ethnic diversity and gender diversity. The Board 
regularly tracks progress against these through Equity, Diversity & 
Inclusion. Further information on Equity, Diversity & Inclusion can  
be found in our Sustainability section on page 61. 

Matters considered by the Board 
Each of the regular meetings includes a wide-ranging report from the 
Chief Executive Officer, together with reports from the Chief Financial 
Officer on the Group’s financial performance and the Chief Operating 
Officer on the continued progress of the Refinitiv integration programme, 
the Group’s transformation programme and Group operations. Reports 
from the Committee Chairs and updates on major projects were also 
provided at each Board meeting. 

Information on workforce engagement can be found in the Stakeholder 
Engagement section on pages 71 and 72. The Board believes that the 
direct and indirect engagement it undertakes with the workforce, as well 
as the range of engagement activities that it has undertaken during the 
year, as described in the stakeholder engagement section, are effective 
and have facilitated meaningful, two-way dialogue between the Board 
and employees. The forms of engagement undertaken during the year 
have enabled the Board to hear from a broad range of our workforce 
across our regions and at different levels of seniority and role type, 
given the size and global footprint of the Group. 

Board independence 
The Board has evaluated the independence of all the Non-Executive 
Directors. In assessing each Director, the Board considers whether there 
are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect or could 
appear to affect a Director’s judgement. 

Martin Brand was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director  
in 2021. Martin represents Blackstone in accordance with the terms of 
the Relationship Agreement, which is considered to be a significant 
shareholder of LSEG.

Scott Guthrie was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director 
with effect from 1 February 2023. Scott represents Microsoft Corporation 
and was appointed in connection with the strategic partnership  
(for further information please see pages 18 and 19). 

The Board agreed that Martin and Scott would not be considered 
independent under the Code given their relationships with Blackstone 
and Microsoft respectively. They are not members of the Audit, 
Remuneration or Risk Committees. 

The Board has evaluated the independence of the other Non-Executive 
Directors and concluded that each are independent in character and 
judgement. The Chair was independent on appointment. 

In line with the Code, at least half the Board, excluding the Chair,  
are independent Non-Executive Directors. All Directors are subject  
to annual re-election at the Company’s AGM. 

During the year, the key matters considered by the Board included  
the following: 

Customers
 — Customer matters, including meetings with customers and key 

account executives during the Board visit to Paris. This included  
deep dives on key customer relationships; FX strategy; and the 
development of product solutions to meet customer needs.

 — Reviews of new products and services, including the non-deliverable 
forward product, the Group’s first global FX trading venue launched

In 2023, it participated in a number of sessions relating to the strategic 
partnership with Microsoft, a number of the Group’s businesses and key 
strategy-related briefings during the Board visit to Paris. This included 
focused sessions on trading and banking in EMEA, Capital Markets  
in Europe and technology operations in Europe. It also held training 
sessions on UK Market Abuse Regulations and the Listing Rules. 

Chairs’ Forum 
The Chairs’ Forum is composed of the Chairs of the Group’s principal 
regulated subsidiaries and the Group Chair, with the Group CEO  
being invited to meetings on a regular basis. The Forum provides 
opportunities for relevant subsidiary Chairs from across the Group  
to engage on common themes and topics of interest. During the year,  
this included: strategic matters, regulatory matters, succession planning, 
customers, technology and migration to the cloud and capital allocation.

Board effectiveness and leadership 
A Board effectiveness review is carried out annually in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), with a review being externally 
facilitated every three years.

2022 Effectiveness Review
The 2022 Effectiveness Review was facilitated externally and identified areas where the Board considered further focus would be needed during 
2023. These are summarised below, together with the resulting actions taken in 2023.

future composition

Board to identify further opportunities to engage 
with shareholders, including their views on LSEG 
and growth; and customers, including a deeper 
understanding of customer needs and the data 
that is most valuable to them

The Board continued efforts to deepen its relationship with the Executive Committee 
throughout the year both on a group and individual basis. This included attendance 
by an Executive Committee member at each Board meeting and inviting members of 
the Executive Committee to join the Board’s visit to the Paris office. 

The Board also met with Erica Bourne, Satvinder Singh and Ron Lefferts following 
their appointments to the Executive Committee, and notably, all presented at Board 
meetings during 2023 and at the Board strategy day.

As reported in its Report on pages 106 to 107, the Nomination Committee continued 
to monitor succession planning to ensure an appropriate schedule is in place to 
effectively manage future Board composition. During the year, the Committee 
recommended, and the Board approved, the appointment of Michel-Alain Proch as 
Group CFO and Executive Director. Michel-Alain joined LSEG on 26 February 2024 
and becomes CFO and Executive Director on 1 March 2024. For more information, 
please see the Nomination Committee report on pages 106 to 108. 

The Board engaged with various stakeholders during 2023, including customers, 
employees and regulators. Further information on this can be found in the Board 
engagement with stakeholders section on pages 69 to 74. 

2023 Effectiveness Review 
In 2023, the Board undertook an internal evaluation of the performance 
of the Board, its Committees, the Chair and the individual Directors.  
The evaluation process was conducted by the Group Company 
Secretary using a detailed questionnaire provided by an external 
provider, Lintstock. 

The 2023 effectiveness review sought the views of Directors on the 
effectiveness of the organisation and dynamics of the Board and  
its Committees, the papers and topics covered at the Board and 
Committee meetings, the purpose and culture of the business, 
stakeholder engagement, the relationship between the Non-Executive 
Directors and management, the current and future composition of  
the Board, the oversight of risk management and internal controls,  
and the leadership of the Board.

The outputs of the evaluation were reported to, and considered by,  
the Board and actions and focus areas for the Board and its Committees 
to undertake in 2024 were agreed.

As part of the 2023 effectiveness review, the Senior Independent 
Director led a review of the performance of the Chair, using a similar 
form of questionnaire provided by Lintstock. The Chair meets with 
Directors individually to discuss their performance.

The results of the effectiveness review will also be used to assist  
in the future development of the Board, its Committees and its  
individual Directors.

Results 
The 2023 effectiveness review identified a number of positive  
attributes including:
 — Board composition and dynamics – current Board composition  

and the relationships between the Non-Executive Directors and the 
Executive Directors.

 — Stakeholder oversight – the Board noted a significant improvement 

in shareholder and investor oversight. 

 — Employee sentiment/culture – Board employee engagement 

sessions were well received.

 — Board support – quality of Board governance and Board support was 

highly rated. 

 — Strategic and operational oversight – the Board noted the improved 

oversight in these areas. 

 — Risk management and internal control – rated positively overall, 
however future areas of focus were identified (see next steps for 
further information). 

Overall, the review found that the Board and its Committees are 
performing well and are effective. The results indicated that the Board 
considers that it has the appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge to enable it and its Committees to 
discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.

Next steps 
The Board agreed that areas of focus for 2024 should be:
 — Board Composition and Dynamics – to build on relationships 

between the Non-Executive Directors and the wider executive team 
particularly in the light of changes to the executive team.

 — Stakeholder Oversight – having benefited from the time spent during 

the year focusing on customers, the Board will seek to further 
increase this in 2024.

 — Strategic Oversight – the Board identified the following areas in 

which focused time should be spent on furthering its understanding 
and oversight capability:
 — Technology, particularly technological change and the  

D&A strategy;

 — Delivery of the Microsoft Partnership and product development;
 — External insights, particularly competitive dynamics; and
 — Organisational capacity to deliver the strategy and continued  
focus on the development of internal talent and pool of future 
succession candidates.

 — Risk Management and Operational Resilience – Oversight of 

operational resilience will remain a key priority for the Board in 2024 
which is seen as important for delivery of the Group’s ambitions and 
for our customers.

The results of the effectiveness reviews of the Committees were 
positive about the management and composition of the Committees  
as well as the quality of the information received. 

Committee 2024 areas of focus 
Audit Committee
 — Additional support and education in relation to sustainability  

and in the business areas and associated risks.

 — Ensuring a smooth transition of the external auditor from EY  

to Deloitte. 

Nomination Committee
 — Continued focus on Board and Executive Committee succession.
 — Performance and development of the Executive Committee.
 — Broader focus on talent management across the Group.

Remuneration Committee
 — Effectively delivering the new remuneration policy.

Risk Committee
 — Provide further support and education around technology matters.
 — Continued focus on operational risk management and further 

improving resiliency.

Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association allow the Board to authorise 
conflicts of interest that may arise and to impose such limits or 
conditions as it thinks fit. The Group has established procedures 
whereby actual and potential conflicts of interest are regularly reviewed, 
appropriate authorisation is sought prior to the appointment of any  
new Director, and new conflicts are addressed appropriately. 

The decision to authorise a conflict of interest can only be made by 
non-conflicted Directors and, in making such decisions, the Directors 
must act in a way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to 
promote the Company’s success. 

Indemnities 
Directors have the benefit of indemnity arrangements from the  
Company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office and 
execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities. The Company 
maintained a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance policy throughout 
the year. This policy covers the Directors for any such liabilities in 
respect of which they are not indemnified by the Company and,  
to the extent to which it has indemnified the Directors, also covers the 
Company. Neither the Company’s indemnity nor insurance provides 
cover for a Director in the event that the Director is proved to have 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly.

Risk management and internal control 
The Board is responsible for ensuring the Group’s risk management 
framework and internal control system is maintained and remains 
effective. This covers all material controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls. The Risk Management Framework prescribes 
the extent of the principal risks the Group is willing to take to achieve its 
long-term strategy. The internal control system safeguards the quality 
and integrity of internal and external financial reporting as well as 
operational, legal and regulatory compliance. 

The system of internal controls is designed to facilitate the management 
of the Group’s activities within the Board’s risk appetite. Rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s objectives, the system 
of internal controls can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material control failures. The Board is committed to 
maintaining a robust internal control system, with a view to continuously 
maturing, embedding and optimising enhanced risk management 
practices throughout the Group.

The Board delegates some of its responsibilities to the Audit Committee 
and Risk Committee.

The Audit Committee regularly works alongside the Risk Committee  
to monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
control systems and risk management systems. The Audit Committee 
also monitors the effectiveness and objectivity of internal and external 
auditors. The Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board on its 
activities. In 2023, the Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s continued 
work to further enhance and mature the internal controls environment, 
despite the withdrawal of some proposals under the Government’s 
planned Audit and Corporate Governance reforms. Further details on 
the activities of the Audit Committee can be found on pages 109 to 114.

The Risk Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities  
by advising on risk strategy and overseeing the development, 
implementation and maintenance of the Group’s Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework (ERMF) and the Group Risk Appetite statement. 
The Risk Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities. 
Further details on the activities of the Risk Committee can be found  
on pages 115 and 116.

A summary of some of the Group’s Risk Management Frameworks and 
internal controls are listed below:

Enterprise Risk Management Framework
The Board annually approves the Group’s ERMF. The ERMF sets out  
a standard approach for managing risk across the Group. It ensures that 
all risks are adequately understood and managed within risk appetite 
across all levels of the Group. During 2023, the Risk Committee 
reviewed the ERMF to identify areas of optimisation to further enhance 
the maturity of the Group’s enterprise risk management. Further details 
on the ERMF can be found in the principal risks and uncertainties 
section from page 79.

Risk Appetite Statement
The Board approves the Group Risk Appetite Statement which outlines 
the key concepts of risk appetite and risk tolerance that the Group will 
accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives. It is determined in line  
with the Group’s strategy. The Group Risk Appetite Statement allows 
management to understand the potential risks associated with strategic 
and operational decisions; assess whether the risk return on capital is 
acceptable; and put in place mitigating actions to reduce risk exposure 
to acceptable levels. It maintains the correct balance between risks and 
rewards, thus ensuring the Group remains more resilient by taking better 
informed decisions.

Further details on the Internal Audit function can be found in  
the internal audit charter which is available on the Group’s website  
at https://www.lseg.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance

Policy Governance Framework
The Group is committed to operating within a robust control 
environment. LSEG has a Policy Governance Framework (PGF) which 
details the internal governance for all Group policies. The PGF outlines 
the development, maintenance, implementation and compliance of all 
Group policies. It details how various risks within Group policies are 
addressed and ensures all Group policies comply with the PGF. 

Management Structure/Delegation of Authority
The Group operates a matrix structure designed to optimise resource 
allocation and organisational capacity. Subject to the Schedule of 
Matters Reserved for the Board, the Board has delegated the day-to-day 
running of the Group to the CEO. The CEO is supported by the Group 
Executive Committee (ExCo), which is designed to ensure open 
challenge and support effective decision-making. Each ExCo member  
is accountable for a key operating division, business area or function.

The ExCo meets regularly to assist the CEO in exercising his authority 
over material matters that have strategic, cross-business area or 
Group-wide implications. Delegation from the Board requires ExCo 
members to maintain responsibility and sustain a control environment 
that is appropriate to their division, business area or function.

The ExCo has established subcommittees: the Financial, Investment  
& Capital Committee (FICC); and the Executive Risk Committee (ERC). 
The remit of the FICC is wide ranging and includes: reviewing the 
financial and legal implications of Group contracts; approving changes 
to the Group’s corporate structure; an annual review of the Group’s 
overall tax governance policy; and monitoring of the Group’s intragroup 
lending arrangements. The ERC oversees matters such as risk culture, 
risk profile oversight, risk policy oversight, risk appetite and risk 
disclosures and reporting.

The Board is satisfied that the operation and effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal controls throughout 2023 and until the date 
of approval of the Annual Report, are sufficiently robust. A thorough 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance and liquidity, 
have been carried out during the year. Necessary actions have been  
or are being taken to remedy any control issues identified during these 
reviews. The Board concluded that the Group’s risk management 
systems are sufficient given the Group’s risk profile, risk appetite and 
long-term strategic objectives. The Board will continue to consider 
further enhancements to its risk management and internal control 
system, to ensure it complies with regulatory and legal developments 
and changes to the external environment.

Further information
Further detail on the Group’s risk management and an overview of the 
principal risks and uncertainties (including a summary of emerging risks) 
of the Group is provided on pages 79 to 88.

Financial Control Framework
LSEG has established a Financial Control Framework (FCF) that sets out 
to develop and maintain a robust financial control environment, that 
mitigates the risk of material financial misstatement, and helps protect 
the Group against financial fraud. The FCF aims to ensure clear links 
between the Group’s financial reporting risks and the associated 
processes and control environment, making sure these are tested  
and appropriately documented. The FCF is also focused on ensuring 
the right culture and training is in place to support a risk-first mindset. 
The Audit Committee receives regular updates on the progress being 
made to enhance the FCF.

Financial reporting controls
Ahead of each reporting period end, the Group’s financial reporting 
process is facilitated using accounting policies and reporting formats 
and is supported by guidance issued to all reporting entities within  
the Group. Management is responsible for maintaining the control 
environment for financial reporting and ensuring policies and 
procedures exist around the maintenance of records. The submission  
of financial reports from each reporting entity is subject to a rigorous 
review. Management must provide assurance regarding the reliability 
and accuracy of the Group’s financial reports. The Audit Committee 
reviews the application of the Group’s accounting policies as well as 
significant accounting judgements and estimates. It also reviews the 
externally reported interim and full-year results and satisfies itself that 
these are fair, balanced and understandable.

Internal Audit
The Board, together with the Audit Committee, is responsible for 
ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the Internal Audit 
function. Internal Audit’s primary function is to provide independent and 
objective assurance to the: Board; Audit Committee; and executive 
management on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal controls. The Internal Audit function provides opinion and 
challenge on the control environment and provides assurance on the 
Group’s ERMF. Internal Audit provides an opinion on the adequacy  
and effectiveness of the Group’s framework of governance, risk 
management and controls on an annual basis. This is achieved through 
a programme of assurance over key risks applicable to the Group and 
audits required by regulation. To ensure independence, the Internal 
Audit function sits within the third line of defence in the Group’s risk 
control structure and has no operational responsibilities for the legal 
entities or processes which it reviews.

The independence of the Internal Audit function from executive 
management is protected by the following measures:
 — The Chief Internal Auditor reports directly to the Chair of the  

Audit Committee and has direct access to the Chair of the Board.  
For administrative matters she has a secondary reporting line to  
the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

 — The Chair of the Audit Committee and CEO jointly assess the 

performance of the Chief Internal Auditor.

 — The Audit Committee approves the Internal Audit Charter and  

annual budget.

Throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and to the date of this report, London Stock Exchange Group plc has complied with all 
principles of the Code, and complied with all provisions of the Code, except for provision 32. Provision 32 of the Code states that the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee should have served on a remuneration committee for at least 12 months before becoming chair. William Vereker was 
appointed as Chair of the Remuneration Committee on 14 September 2023, having served on the Committee since 3 October 2022. William Vereker 
is an experienced Board member with significant knowledge of financial services, regulatory matters and corporate governance. The Board agreed 
that William was suitably qualified to take on the role of Remuneration Committee Chair and to oversee the review of the Remuneration Policy.  
The decision to appoint William as Committee Chair shortly before 12 months of experience on a remuneration committee was taken to allow  
William to lead the Committee on the proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy, including consultation with shareholders. He is supported 
 in his role by the other Committee members, including Cressida Hogg, the previous Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 

The Code is publicly available at the website of the UK Financial Reporting Council at www.frc.org.uk. Details of how the principles of the Code  
have been applied can be found throughout this Corporate Governance Report, the Strategic Report, and the Committee reports. The following

Report of the  
Nomination Committee

Key areas of focus for the 
Committee in the year were  
Board composition, succession 
planning and the appointment  
of Michel-Alain Proch as Chief 
Financial Officer and Executive 
Director. This report describes  
the work of the Committee.

Don Robert 
Chair of the Nomination Committee

Achievements for 2023
The priorities set by the Committee at the start of the year were: 
1.  Continue to ensure a diverse talent pipeline.
2.  Review succession plans for Non-Executive Directors to ensure that 
future changes are appropriately managed to avoid a significant 
number of changes in quick succession.

3.  Continue to keep Executive Committee succession planning  

under review.

Composition and meetings
The Committee’s membership is composed of all the Non-Executive 
Directors. Structuring the membership in this way enables Non-
Executive Directors to participate in all discussions relating to Board 
composition and succession planning, reflecting the importance  
placed by both LSEG and the Code on these areas. The names and 
biographies of the Non-Executive Directors who sit on this Committee 
can be found on pages 94 to 97 of this report.

The Group Company Secretary is the Secretary to the Committee  
and attends all meetings. The Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO),  
Chief People Officer and external advisers attend where requested by 
the Committee.

Committee purpose and responsibilities
The Nomination Committee is responsible for monitoring the balance of 
skills, knowledge and experience as well as the diversity of the Board.  
It is also responsible for making recommendations of new appointments 
to the Board and overseeing Board and senior management succession 
planning. Further details on the responsibilities of the Nomination 
Committee can be found in the Committee’s terms of reference  
which are reviewed annually and available on the Group’s website at: 
https://www.lseg.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance.

The Committee met four times during the year and, in addition, 
Committee members also met with Director and senior management 
candidates. I am pleased to confirm that the Committee’s priorities  
have been met, as described in this report.

Key activities in the year
Board succession planning and Board appointments
The Board recognises the need to regularly refresh the balance of skills, 
tenure and diversity on the Board. During the year, the Committee 
reviewed the structure, size and composition of the Board and its 
Committees, to ensure critical skills and experience were refreshed.  
In carrying out its review, the Committee took account of recent and 
likely future Board changes, Board expertise, diversity and tenure.  
This review helped the Committee to identify Board succession 
requirements. Appointments to the Board are subject to a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure.

Following the announcement on 25 May 2023 that Anna Manz  
would step down from the Board as CFO and Executive Director, the 
Nomination Committee approved the appointment of Russell Reynolds, 
an external search consultancy which is a signatory to the Enhanced 
Voluntary Code of Conduct for executive search firms, to assist in the 
search for a new CFO and Executive Director. The Committee approved 
an outline brief and role specification and Russell Reynolds was 
instructed to produce a diverse list of candidates for consideration.

David Schwimmer provided regular updates to the Board and the 
Committee on the progress of the search. Shortlisted candidates were 
interviewed by the CEO, the Chair and members of the Executive 
Committee. The final two preferred candidates met with Cressida Hogg, 
Dominic Blakemore and William Vereker, the Senior Independent 
Director, Chair of Audit Committee and Chair of Remuneration 
Committee, respectively. Other members of the Nomination Committee 
were also then invited to meet with the preferred candidate. Following 
this interview process, the Nomination Committee recommended, and 
the Board approved, the appointment of Michel-Alain Proch as CFO and 
Executive Director. Michel-Alain joined the Group on 26 February 2024 
and will become CFO and Executive Director with effect from 1 March 
2024. Michel-Alain brings deep experience across global, financial 
infrastructure and IT data solutions firms. He was previously CFO for 
Publicis Groupe SA where he led the global finance team across 100 
countries. Prior to this, he held several listed company CFO positions, 
including at Ingenico and Atos, where he was also CEO, North America 
and Group Chief Digital Officer. Michael-Alain serves as Vice-Chairman 
of the Board, Maisons du Monde and Non-Executive Director of Pluxee.

As disclosed in last year’s Nomination Committee report, the Company 
announced a 10-year strategic partnership with Microsoft and that  
as part of the partnership Scott Guthrie, Microsoft’s Executive Vice 
President, Cloud and AI Group, joined the Board on 1 February 2023. 
Scott’s appointment was approved by shareholders at the AGM in April 
2023. In accordance with the terms of the Relationship Agreement,  
Erin Brown, representative of Thomson Reuters, stepped down from  
the Board on 17 March 2023, and Doug Steenland, representative of 
Blackstone, stepped down from the Board on 20 September 2023.  
The Board thanks Erin and Doug for their contribution to the Board  
since the acquisition of Refinitiv in 2021.

Senior management appointments
During the year, the Committee met with the CEO and Chief People 
Officer to review succession plans and the pipeline for successions  
for executive management including consideration of diversity.  
As described on page 14 there were a number of changes to the 
Executive Committee during the year and the Board Chair, Don Robert, 
participated in the interview and selection process as well as other 
Committee members as appropriate. The Committee continues to 
support the CEO in executive succession planning, for emergency cover 
and longer-term appointments and the Committee regularly challenges 
the CEO on diversity and inclusion in regard to senior management 
succession planning.

The Group Executive Committee is formed of individuals from a diverse 
range of backgrounds. As at 31 December 2023, 38% of the Executive 
Committee members were female and 15% were from an ethnic minority 
background. The names and biographies for the Group Executive 
Committee can be found on page 15 of this report. 

The Group is committed to seeking broader diversity in our leadership 
with the aim of having more representation from different ethnic and 
other backgrounds at Executive and Group Leader level. With respect  
to under-represented ethnic and racial groups, we did not achieve our 
goal to reach 20% within the leadership community by the end of 2023, 
closing the year at 14%. We remain focused on making progress through 
leadership development programmes for underrepresented talent. For 
more information on the actions we are taking, refer to page 26 of our 
2023 Sustainability Report.

Time commitment
The Committee reviews the time commitments of the Directors and 
approves any significant external appointments being undertaken by  
the Directors. During the year, the Committee reviewed the additional 
external appointments of Anna Manz and Ashok Vaswani. The 
Committee and/or the Board agreed that the proposed appointments  
at AstraZeneca PLC and Kotak Mahindra Bank, respectively, would  
not create any material conflict of interest. Both Directors were 
simultaneously giving up an existing Board position so their overall 
number of directorships would remain the same. They were therefore 
able to confirm that they would have sufficient time to undertake these 
new roles in addition to existing commitments.

Board effectiveness
The results of the 2023 Board effectiveness review are described on 
pages 102 and 103. Ensuring the skills and experience on the Board 
were of the appropriate mix was a key area of focus for 2023, and this  
is reflected in the work of the Nomination Committee. This year’s results 
and agreed areas of focus for the Board are described on pages 102 
and 103. The Board will ensure that these focus areas are acted on to 
further improve Board performance.

Diversity & Inclusion
The Board’s membership reflects a wide range of skills and business 
experience, drawn from a number of industries, which is critical for 
bringing the expertise required and for enabling different perspectives 
to be brought to Board discussions. The combination of these factors 
means that the Board benefits from a diverse range of competencies, 
perspectives and thoughts, providing an ability to challenge on strategic 
issues and a dynamic environment for decision-making.

The Board reviewed and approved its Board Diversity Policy which 
outlines the importance of diversity of gender, social and ethnic 
backgrounds, and of cognitive and personal strengths to the Board.  
The Policy is available on the Group website at https:// www.lseg.com/
en/about-us/corporate-governance. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Board met all of the targets set out in the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rule 9.8.6R(9)(a). The table overleaf 
sets out the diversity data of the Board and executive management as at 
31 December 2023.

Ethnicity data reflects countries where LSEG collects this information.
1  Defined as the Executive Committee and the Company Secretary in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10).
2  Rounded percentages sum to 99%. To 1 decimal place, percentages would be 83.3%, 8.3% and 8.3%.

Board diversity data is collected directly from each Director using  
a questionnaire and was provided on a self-identifying basis. 

At the end of 2023, female representation on the Board was 42%.  
The Board is also pleased to confirm that it has met the Parker Review 
recommendations and included two Directors from minority ethnic 
backgrounds. Throughout 2023, two of the four senior positions on the 
Board were held by women. Following the resignation of Anna Manz 
and the appointment of Michel-Alain Proch, female representation will 
be below 40%. The Board will continue to seek to ensure that these 
goals are met in the longer term.

Appointments and succession plans are based on merit and objective 
criteria. Other than appointments covered under the Relationship 
Agreement and the partnership with Microsoft, the Company uses 
external search consultancies when making appointments to key 
positions. These firms are required to provide a diverse list of 
candidates for senior roles. In particular, the Board’s succession and 
appointment approach aims to secure balanced and diverse shortlists 
for new appointments.

The Group was an early signatory of HM Treasury’s Women in Finance 
Charter in the UK and met the stretch goal of reaching 40% female 
representation in our senior leadership population by the end of 2022. 
We have also made progress during the year on improving gender 
diversity within the subsidiary companies of the Group, which has 
increased to 32% (2022: 25%). 

In 2023 we developed an enhanced methodology to help us review our 
equity, diversity and inclusion goals to ensure they remain relevant and 
appropriate, and have used this to set new goals for 2024 and beyond:
 — Gender: maintain at least 40% of women in senior leadership  

(ExCo and Group Leaders) going forward 

 — Ethnicity: 25% underrepresented ethnic groups in senior leadership 

roles (ExCo and Group Leaders) by 2027.

LSEG is a member of the Valuable 500, a collective of 500 CEOs and 
their companies, innovating together for disability inclusion. For further 
information on senior leadership gender and ethnicity representation 
please see our Sustainability section on page 61.

Priorities for 2024
The priorities set by the Committee for 2024 are:
1. Continue to ensure a diverse talent pipeline.
2.  Review succession plans for Non-Executive Directors to ensure that 

future changes are appropriately managed to avoid several Directors 
stepping down in quick succession.

3.  Continue to keep Executive Committee succession planning  

under review.

Committee effectiveness
The Committee’s effectiveness was assessed as part of the 2023  
Board and Committee effectiveness review, facilitated internally via  
a questionnaire provided by Lintstock. Further details can be found in the 
Governance section of this report on page 102. The result of the review 
was that the Committee is performing well and operating effectively.

A key focus for the Audit 
Committee this year was the 
changing regulatory and corporate 
governance landscape. The 
enhancements to the Group’s 
financial control framework,  
and the plans around sustainability 
assurance, were therefore 
important topics during the year.

Dominic Blakemore
Chair of the Audit Committee

Achievements for 2023
The main achievements of the Audit Committee in 2023 were:
 — reviewing and recommending to the Board the full-year and half-year 

2023 results and approving the associated key accounting 
judgements and estimates;

 — reviewing and approving our Annual Report and Accounts;
 — oversight of the 2023 external audit;
 — monitoring and reviewing several financial matters including 

acquisitions and the progress of specific uncertain tax provisions;
 — reviewing the progress against the plan to create a leading financial 

control framework; 

 — reviewing the broader landscape for sustainability and climate risk 

reporting as well as Audit and Corporate Governance Reform and the 
Group’s plans for ensuring it remains compliant with future changes to 
the reporting requirements; 

 — the completion of the audit tender process and decision to appoint 

Deloitte LLP as the Group’s new external auditor; and

 — oversight of the progress of the transition to the new external auditor.

Committee role and responsibilities 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing and monitoring 
financial reporting (including climate-related financial disclosures), 
internal controls systems and risk management systems. 

The key responsibilities of the Committee are: 
 — monitoring the integrity of the financial statements; 
 — reviewing significant financial reporting matters and  

accounting policies;

 — assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and  

risk management systems (along with the Risk Committee);
 — monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s  

Internal Audit function, including its scope of work and findings,  
and ensuring that it has adequate resources and appropriate access 
to information to perform its duties effectively and independently  
from executive management;

 — overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, including 
monitoring their objectivity and independence, approving the  
annual audit plan and reviewing external audit findings; and

 — approving the external audit fees, monitoring non-audit fees paid to 
the external auditor and ensuring that the external audit is put out to 
tender on a periodic basis.

Further details on the functions and responsibilities of the Committee 
can be found in the Committee’s Terms of Reference which are 
reviewed annually and are available from the Group Company Secretary 
or in the corporate governance section of the Group’s website at: 
https://www.lseg.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance.

The Audit Committee Terms of Reference were updated and approved 
by the Board during the year to align with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC) new Audit Committee Minimum Standard and to include 
responsibility over certain non-financial reporting requirements including 
sustainability disclosure. 

This report considers how the Committee has fulfilled its responsibilities 
during the year.

Report of the Audit Committee continued

Committee membership and attendance
The Committee comprises four (2022: four) Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. All Committee members have been in place for the full year. 

Other members of management may also be invited to present  
specific matters. The Group Company Secretary is the Secretary to  
the Committee.

The skills and experience of each Committee member are provided in 
the Board of Directors section on pages 94 to 97. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) requires that at least one member of the 
Committee should have recent and relevant financial experience and 
that members shall have competence relevant to the sector in which the 
Company operates. The Committee members have a wide range of 
experience. The Chair of the Committee, Dominic Blakemore, is a 
qualified chartered accountant with a career in a variety of senior 
finance roles. The Chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees each sit  
on both committees, which makes sure that issues relevant to both 
committees are identified and managed.

The Committee’s effectiveness was assessed as part of the 2023 Board 
effectiveness review. More details on the Committee’s effectiveness can 
be found in the Governance section of this report on pages 102 to 103.

The Group Chair, Group Chief Executive Officer, Group Chief Financial 
Officer, Group Financial Controller, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Chief 
Internal Auditor, and representatives of the external auditor, EY LLP (EY), 
are all regular attendees at Committee meetings. Representatives of 
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) also started to attend Audit Committee meetings 
ahead of their formal appointment as auditors to the Group in 2024. 

In addition to formal meetings, the Chair of the Committee and some 
Committee members met with senior management during the year.  
The Chair of the Committee also meets separately with the external 
auditor, as required, ahead of each meeting. 

Activities during the year
Below we set out the main work undertaken by the  
Audit Committee covering:
1. Financial reporting;
2. Internal controls, internal audit and risk management;
3. Oversight of the external auditor; and
4. Other activities in the year.

1. Financial reporting
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions and 
matters related to the financial statements
The Committee reviewed, discussed and approved the half-year  
and full-year financial results, significant accounting judgements and 
estimates and the adequacy of disclosures. The main topics considered 
are set out below, the first four of which are also identified as key audit 
matters by the external auditor.

Matter considered

How the Committee addressed the matter

Acquisitions of Acadia and Yieldbroker
During 2023, the Group completed two significant acquisitions.  
This required the valuation of acquired tangible and intangible assets, 
including customer relationships, technology and goodwill.

The fair value of acquired intangible assets and resulting goodwill 
recognised on acquisition are subject to significant estimates. These 
include the future performance of the acquired business and the rate  
of return required to determine an appropriate discount rate (in order  
to calculate the net present value of the assets acquired).

Measurement of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill
The Group carries significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible 
assets on its balance sheet. In line with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, 
goodwill allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units is assessed  
for impairment. An assessment of the useful life and amortisation method 
was performed for certain acquired intangibles, for which there were 
indicators that a change in amortisation method or amortisation period  
may be required.

Impairment tests for the Group’s CGUs are based on value-in-use 
calculations which require significant estimates over:
 — future performance;
 — growth rates; and
 — discount rates.

Capitalisation and subsequent impairment of internally  
developed software 
The Group continues to develop and capitalise significant levels of 
software. The capitalisation of software development costs involves 
management judgement against criteria set in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.

The Committee reviewed the acquisition accounting for each significant 
acquisition, including:
 — determination of the consideration paid;
 — assessment of arrangements for any contingent payments;
 — identification and valuation of acquired net assets with a particular focus 

on intangible assets;
 — resulting goodwill; and
 — alignment with LSEG accounting policies.

The Committee satisfied itself that goodwill and purchased intangibles had 
been recognised appropriately.

See note 9 to the financial statements on pages 195 to 199. 

The Committee considered the approach and methodology to performing 
the detailed annual CGU impairment assessment. This included reviewing 
key assumptions:
 — cash flow expectations;
 — short- and long-term growth rates; and
 — discount rates used for the CGU’s cost of capital.

Given the significant changes in inflation and interest rates during the year, 
the Committee was particularly focused on the growth rate assumptions and 
the discount rates used. 

The Committee considered and approved the change in amortisation 
method of particular purchased software intangible assets as well as 
changes in useful life for certain assets.

See note 9 to the financial statements on pages 195 to 199 for details of  
the impairment review. 

The Committee reviewed the methodology used to capitalise software 
development costs and satisfied itself that it was adequate and in conformity 
with IFRS.

The Committee also considered possible indicators of impairment for 
significant internally developed software. 

The Committee approved the recognition of £10 million of internally 
developed software asset impairment in the year.

Matter considered

How the Committee addressed the matter

Revenue recognition
The Group generates revenue from a variety of sources that are material 
in size and volume. Judgements are applied to the timing of revenue 
recognition and year-end revenue accruals, particularly across 
subscription revenues, primary markets admission fees, deferred listings 
revenue and FTSE Russell revenue accruals.

Uncertain tax positions
The Group is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it 
operates. There are five main ongoing tax assessments for which the 
Group has used guidance under IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax 
Treatments to determine the possible outcomes, and any related 
obligations, and to assign a probability to each of those outcomes:
 — EU State Aid
 — US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Audit
 — Russian tax audit
 — Valuation of certain Refinitiv intellectual property
 — Diverted Profits Tax to Thomson Reuters

Non-underlying items/alternative performance measures
The Group separately identifies results before non-underlying items 
(these are referred to as “adjusted”). The Group uses its judgement to 
classify items as non-underlying (see note 2.3 to the financial statements 
on page 181).

The Committee was satisfied that sufficient analysis had been performed 
in this area to conclude that revenue has been recognised appropriately 
and that there is no evidence that any manipulation of revenues has  
taken place.

The Committee also reviewed the significance of judgements applied and 
discussed any necessary disclosure requirements. It was concluded that 
no judgement on revenue recognition required individual disclosure in the 
Annual Report.

The Committee reviewed the main items at each Committee meeting with 
a particular focus on the in-year developments below:
 — IRS Audit: The Committee has assessed the financial reporting 

implications of the Group’s ongoing discussions with the IRS in relation 
to the funding structure within its US subsidiaries following partial 
settlement agreed in the year.

 — Russian tax audit The Committee discussed the audit by the Russian 
Tax Authorities for the period 2018-2020, which the Group expects to 
be settled locally on a similar basis to the settlement for the audit of the 
period 2021-2022.

 — Diverted Profits Tax: The Committee noted that HMRC’s review of two 
of the three years had been completed, allowing for a reduction in the 
associated provision.

The Audit Committee determined that the provisions and disclosure for 
these matters are appropriate.

See note 6.3 to the financial statements on page 193 for details of the 
uncertain tax positions. 

The Committee discussed and agreed on the classification of non-
underlying items in the financial statements for the year. In particular, the 
Committee discussed the nature and amounts of:
 — transaction costs;
 — integration and separation costs;
 — restructuring costs;
 — remeasurement gains; and
 — amortisation of purchased intangibles, mainly linked to the acquisition of 

Refinitiv in 2021.

The Committee increased the financial threshold for items to be 
considered as non-underlying, to ensure that only significant items,  
and those not in the ordinary course of business, are treated as  
non-underlying. The Committee discussed the quality of earnings in 
relation to the Group’s adjusted operating profit.

See note 2.3 to the financial statements on page 181. 

Pensions
The Group operates four defined benefit pension schemes and 
recognises a net surplus in relation to these schemes on the Group 
balance sheet. For the Group’s defined benefit schemes, judgement is 
applied to the amount of the retirement benefit assets recognised on the 
balance sheet. The defined benefit pension liabilities recognised are 
determined based on the present value of future benefit obligations 
using assumptions determined by the Group with advice from an 
independent qualified actuary.

The Committee considered the approach for the value of the retirement 
benefit assets and the assumptions applied in the calculation of the 
retirement benefit obligations. 

The Committee assessed the full buy-in policy for the LSEG Pension 
scheme and the impact on the retirement benefit surplus. 

The Committee was satisfied with the approach and assumptions applied 
by management and that a defined benefit surplus can be recognised.

See note 12 to the financial statements on pages 203 to 207.

2. Internal controls, internal audit and risk management
The Committee continued to exercise disciplined oversight of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and Internal Audit  
function, in line with principles of the Code. It fulfilled its responsibilities 
by reviewing and discussing regular reports from management,  
the external auditor and the Internal Audit function including: 
 — reports on compliance with the Code – internal controls  

 — quarterly updates on internal audit delivery; 
 — regular updates on improvements to the Internal Audit function; 
 — an annual report on the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function  

at the first Committee meeting of the year; and

 — the external audit management letter from EY. The letter highlighted 

areas for improvement which were noted by the Committee for 
follow-up.

(including whistleblowing); 

 — a report on the Group’s plan to comply with the UK Government’s 

Audit and Corporate Governance reform;

 — three progress updates on the programme to create a single and 

leading financial control framework;

111

During the year, the Committee received an update on the Internal Audit 
function, which included: 
 — the development of a refreshed target operating model to reflect the 
enlarged business and global footprint. The Committee endorsed the 
approach for building out the global audit function;

Report of the Audit Committee continued

 — a review of Internal Audit’s balanced scorecard; and
 — the Results of Quality Assurance activities undertaken during the year.

Impact of acquisitions and disposals on the risk landscape
As a result of the acquisitions throughout the year, the internal audit 
universe was updated to reflect the changed organisation. As part of 
annual planning, an inherent risk assessment was undertaken which, 
alongside regulatory requirement for internal audit work, guided the 
audit plan for 2023 and, similarly, the plan for 2024. 

Management is undertaking significant work to ensure that the risk 
landscape is fully understood and that appropriate controls are in 
place to mitigate risk to within the firm’s stated risk appetite over 
time. This work will be supported by the Risk function and by Internal 
Audit, both of whom are building out resources to support the 
necessary oversight and assurance. 

Internal Audit provides independent assurance on the design and 
effectiveness of controls that support first line business activities as well 
as the Group’s risk management and governance frameworks. Internal 
Audit adopts a risk-based audit approach that prioritises providing 
assurance over the management of key risks that may impact the Group. 

As regards the work of Internal Audit, the Committee: 
 — monitored Internal Audit’s progress against the 2023 Audit Plan, 

including reviewing and approving any changes to the plan during  
the course of the year; 

 — in December 2023, considered and approved the 2024 Internal Audit 

plan and budget and is satisfied that the plan is appropriate;
 — received the annual Internal Audit Opinion which sets out the 
function’s view on the effectiveness of the Group’s control 
environment and risk culture as well as themes and root cause 
analysis arising from audit work performed;

 — received updates on emerging audit issues and themes during  

the course of the year;

 — tracked management’s progress to address actions within  

reasonable timeframes;

 — approved the Internal Audit Charter which remained consistent  

with the prior year;

 — tracked the implementation of functional improvement actions which 
followed from the 2022 External Quality Assurance review, which 
confirmed that Internal Audit generally conforms with applicable 
Internal Auditing standards; and

 — received a report from the Head of Audit Practices and Operations  

on the results of the function’s Quality Assurance activities. 

The Committee obtained additional comfort by meeting with the Group 
Chief Internal Auditor at each Committee meeting without executive 
management present. In addition, the Group Chief Internal Auditor 
meets regularly with the Chair of the Audit Committee. The Group  
Chief Internal Auditor continues to report to the Audit Committee Chair 
with a secondary reporting line to the Group Chief Executive Officer.  
This is consistent with industry guidance. 

The activities of the Committee relating to internal controls enabled it to 
satisfy itself that the Internal Audit function is independent, objective  
and adequately staffed to perform its duties. In addition, the Committee 
assessed the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function throughout the 
year using qualitative and quantitative indicators including: 
 — the Internal Audit balanced scorecard which is presented at each 

Committee meeting and reflects key performance indicators relating 
to internal audit plan delivery, quality assurance results, staff 
engagement and resourcing, as well as the financial management  
of the function; 

 — completeness of the audit plan against the agreed coverage model;
 — quality of the audit reports and the issues raised;
 — root cause insights on the issues raised and feedback from executive 

management on specific audits; and

 — other performance indicators such as the distribution of audit  
ratings, percentage of past due actions and percentage of  
self-identified issues. 

The Committee concluded that the Internal Audit function is both 
independent and effective, in line with principle M of the Code.  
In addition, the Committee (in conjunction with the Risk Committee) 
relied on this assurance process throughout the year to recommend to 
the full Board that it could report to shareholders on the effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems. This 
assurance satisfies principle O of the Code. The Board statement can 
be found on page 104. 

3. Oversight of the external auditor
The Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the 
relationship with the external auditor. This includes recommending  
the auditor’s appointment at the AGM, continuous assessment of the 
auditor’s independence, the effectiveness and quality of the audit, 
approving the statutory audit fee and non-audit services, reviewing and 
approving the annual audit plan and meeting with the external auditor  
to review any issues and the findings of the audit.

The Committee reviewed and approved the 2023 audit plan presented 
by EY. This included the scope of the audit, the assessment of the key 
audit risks and areas of focus as well as the materiality threshold for the 
Group and the threshold for reporting unadjusted differences. Reports 
from EY on the status of their 2023 plan and the results of their work,  
as well as EY’s own assessment of their independence, were received 
throughout the year. The external auditor’s reports were discussed at 
each Committee meeting and their views and opinions used to 
challenge decisions by the Group.

The Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external audit 
throughout the year in accordance with principle M of the Code.  
The Committee relied on its own judgement supported by the  
following evidence:
 — a report from management on their own evaluation of the 

effectiveness of the external auditor based on a questionnaire 
prepared in accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) 
guidance and completed by key stakeholders;

 — a review of the FRC’s 2022/2023 Audit Quality Inspection and 

Supervision Report, specifically the report related to EY. The Audit 
Committee also reviewed the results of the FRC’s inspection of the 
LSEG 2021 year end audit which highlighted limited improvements 
required; and

 — the separate meetings held with EY at each Committee meeting 

without management being present.

Based on all evidence presented, the Committee satisfied itself that the 
external audit has been conducted effectively, with appropriate rigour 
and challenge, and that EY had applied appropriate professional 
scepticism throughout the audit.

EY were appointed as the Group’s external auditor in 2014. The lead 
audit partner and other key partners identified are required to rotate 
every five years. Other partners are required to rotate every seven 
years. Simon Michaelson was reappointed as lead audit partner  
during the year and is in his second year. 

The Committee is responsible for conducting the process to select the 
external auditor and recommends their appointment, reappointment  
and removal to the Board for approval by the Group’s shareholders at 
each AGM.

Getting ready for a change in auditor 
As disclosed in last year’s report, following an audit tender 
process in 2022, the Audit Committee recommended to the 
Board that Deloitte be appointed as the Group’s external auditor 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2024, subject to 
shareholder approval at our AGM. 

In early 2023, the Committee was made aware of non-audit tax 
advisory services which were provided to certain entities  
within the Group by Deloitte, which audited one of the Group’s 
subsidiaries. It was concluded that these services were prohibited 
under the FRC’s Ethical Standard. EY placed reliance on the work 
performed by this component audit firm. As a result, a special 
Audit Committee meeting was held to review the independence 
of our external auditors and the services being provided and 
relied upon. The decision to change auditor to Deloitte was 
upheld but additional reviews of independence as a part of the 
onboarding process were undertaken throughout the year. 

As a part of the onboarding process, the Group have undertaken 
the following:
 — Worked with Deloitte to make sure that they are fully 

independent ahead of 1 January 2024.

 — The Group updated its policy for “Services supplied by  

Audit firms”, which clarifies key deliverables and responsibilities 
of audit firms as well as adding further internal controls to 
monitor services provided by audit firms.

 — Testing of Deloitte’s tools and technology to ensure they meet 

the Group’s information security requirements.

Deloitte have started preliminary work to gain an understanding 
of the Group and have shadowed EY during their audit of the 
Group’s 2023 Annual Report and Accounts, including attending 
some meetings alongside EY. 

The Committee satisfied itself that the procedures of Deloitte  
in their capacity as auditor of Tradeweb have been conducted 
independently and have not impeded the effectiveness of the 
existing external auditor.

Report on external auditor’s fees and safeguards on  
non-audit services
The Committee has a policy governing the engagement of the external 
auditor to provide non-audit services, which is reviewed on an annual 
basis. This policy was updated during the year to reflect Deloitte’s role 
as incoming auditor, and the policy has been applied to both EY and 
Deloitte during the year. 

The policy prohibits certain activities from being undertaken by the 
external auditor such as: accounting/bookkeeping services; internal 
auditing; certain tax and payroll services; executive recruitment; 
remuneration services; and more generally any work which could 
compromise their independence. The policy also places restrictions  
on the employment of former employees of the external auditor.

Recognising that the external auditor may be best placed to undertake 
certain work, the policy permits the provision of certain audit-related  
and non-audit services. The policy allows approval for any audit and 
non-audit services below £100k to be delegated to the Group Chief 
Financial Officer. Any such approvals are then reported to the Audit 
Committee at the next meeting.

The Committee fully complied with the policy in the year. It reviewed 
each of the appointments on their merits and considered management’s 
assessment of:
 — the threats to independence and objectivity resulting from the 

provision of such services;

 — whether there were any conflicts of interest; and
 — the quantum of non-audit fees in the context of the overall audit fee.

A breakdown of audit and non-audit service fees paid and payable to 
the external auditor for the year ended 31 December 2023 is provided 
below and in Note 4.2 to the financial statements on page 188.

EY provided non-audit services of £0.7 million; 5% of total fees  
(2022: £0.6 million; 4% of total fees). This comprised of audit related 
assurance services of £0.4 million (2022: £0.4 million) and other 
non-audit services £0.3 million (2022: £0.2 million).

In each case, the Committee concluded that the appointment of EY  
to perform certain non-audit services would not impair their 
independence and represented the most effective, secure and efficient 
way of obtaining the necessary advice and services. The Committee 
was satisfied that the Group and EY have been compliant with IESBA 
and FRC auditor independence rules. 

The Committee has complied with the relevant parts of the Competition 
and Markets Authority Final Order on the statutory audit market for the 
year ended 31 December 2023.

4. Other matters
Going concern and long-term financial viability statement
The Directors are required to assess whether it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis and, in 
accordance with the Code, provide a statement on the Group’s viability. 
At its meeting in February 2024, the Committee reviewed the Group’s 
forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance. It confirmed that the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements continues to be appropriate. 
See page 159 of the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for the 
going concern statement. At the same meeting, the Committee also 
considered the Group’s long-term viability with reference to the Group’s 
current position and prospects, three-year business plan, risk appetite 
and the expected impact of severe but plausible downside scenarios  
on the business. See page 89 of the Strategic Report for the financial 
viability statement.

FRC Corporate Reporting Review
As part of the FRC’s Corporate Reporting Review, the FRC conducted  
a review of the Group’s 2022 Annual Report. The review was conducted 
independently and the scope of the review was based on and limited  
to the information provided in the 2022 Annual Report1. The Group 
received correspondence from the FRC in October 2023 requesting 
further information in relation to the alternative performance measures 
included in the Group’s financial reporting and on climate-related 
financial disclosures. 

1  The FRC review provides no assurance that the LSEG Annual Report 2022 was correct in all material respects. The FRC’s role was not to verify the information provided, but to consider 

compliance with reporting requirements. Its letters are written on the basis that the FRC (which includes the FRC’s officers, employees and agents) accepts no liability for reliance on them by  
LSEG or any third party, including but not limited to investors and shareholders.

Report of the Audit Committee continued

The Group provided a response to the FRC in November 2023, 
responding to the questions raised and how they have been addressed 
in this Annual Report. The Audit Committee was informed on the 
response submitted to the FRC. The FRC responded in December 
2023, confirming that their enquiries are now closed. 

Fair, balanced and understandable (FBU) reporting
In line with principle N of the Code, the Committee satisfied itself that 
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and has 
presented its conclusions to the Board. The Committee reviewed drafts 
of the Annual Report and Accounts and considered the following:
 — that statutory measures have been given equal prominence to the 

alternative performance measures used;

 — that information contained in the Strategic Report represents a fair 

reflection of performance during the year;

 — information within the Strategic Report and narrative reporting across 
the Annual Report is consistent with that reported in the financial 
statements; and

 — key areas of estimate and judgement are consistently applied. 

The Committee discussed with management the process undertaken  
to ensure that the relevant requirements of FBU reporting were met. 
This process included:
 — independent reviews of the entire report by people not directly 

involved in preparing the report; 

 — extensive review and verification processes by the appropriate 

departments and senior managers to ensure the accuracy of the 
content; and

 — consideration of the balance of disclosure between positive and 

negative points on the Group’s performance in the year.

See page 159 of the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for the  
FBU statement.

Audit and Corporate Governance Reform
The Committee received a number of updates on how the Group is 
preparing for the UK Government’s Audit and Corporate Governance 
Reform. While the UK Government has now withdrawn and delayed 
some of the proposals, the Group remains committed to enhancing its 
internal control environment and has continued to implement its main 
programmes. The Committee monitored and assessed the progress of: 
 — the refresh of the Financial Control Framework;
 — the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Operational 

Resilience programmes;

 — the fraud risk assessment performed in the year; and
 — steps being taken to improve control training and risk-awareness.

The Committee noted that the revised UK Corporate Governance Code 
was issued in January 2024, effective from 2025, and that the ongoing 
programmes around internal controls put the Group in a good position 
to meet the requirements of the new Code. 

Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard
During the year, the FRC announced its Audit Committees and the 
External Audit: Minimum Standard. The Committee discussed and 
reviewed the Audit Committee responsibilities and the minimum 
requirements set out for an Audit Committee to perform. The Committee 
noted and were comfortable with the requirements set out and updated 
its own Terms of Reference to align with the Standard.

Sustainability and climate risk reporting
The Committee reviewed the broader landscape for sustainability and 
climate risk reporting and the Group’s plans for ensuring it remains 
compliant with future changes to the reporting requirements. 

During the year, the ISSB issued IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 (the “Standards”) to 
improve disclosures about sustainability of a company. The Committee 
noted the implications of the new Standards, that once endorsed by the 
UK Endorsement Board LSEG is subject to the mandatory sustainability 
reporting requirements to be reported on for the first time for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2024, and the procedures being 
undertaken in advance of the reporting requirement coming into force.

Incoming regulation, notably the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD), will introduce mandatory assurance of reported 
sustainability data. The Committee discussed CSRD and the findings of 
an independent pre-assurance readiness report commissioned by the 
Group covering LSEG’s current processes, systems and controls over 
the calculation and disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, which was 
used as a case study. The Committee also noted the Group’s plan to 
address the findings of the report as a part of the broader sustainability 
reporting agenda.

Whistleblowing investigations
The Group’s whistleblowing policy provides a method of addressing 
concerns while at the same time offering whistleblowers protection from 
victimisation, harassment or disciplinary proceedings. During the year, 
the Committee continued to closely monitor the effectiveness and 
independence of the Speak-Up and whistleblowing arrangements  
of the Group.

Areas of focus in 2024 
 — Assessing the Group’s readiness to comply with climate-related 

disclosure requirements, including the CSRD.

 — Monitoring the progress of the Financial Control Framework.
 — Receiving early and continuous understanding of the impact of the 
Group’s acquisitions and disposals on financial and tax accounting, 
and ensuring that the transactions are accurately represented in the 
Group’s Annual Reports and Accounts.

 — Monitoring the Group’s uncertain tax positions.
 — Continuing to assess the impact of developments in  

accounting standards.

 — Monitoring the progress of the external audit transition from  
EY to Deloitte and ensuring Deloitte’s readiness for the 2024 
year-end audit. 

 — Receiving assurance that the internal control and risk management 

environment remains robust.

 — Monitoring the enhanced use of data in Internal Audit work to  

provide broader insights and analysis.

 — Monitoring the development and embedding of audit programmes  

of work related to specialisms such as sustainability and behavioural 
risks across the Internal Audit function.

 — Supporting the build-out of the Internal Audit capabilities in the areas 

of transformation and change assurance.

Achievements for 2023
During the year, the Risk Committee prioritised programmes and 
activities identified at the end of the previous financial year with the  
aim of enabling the safe growth of the Group by continuing to improve 
the Group’s risk culture and ensuring that risks stayed within the set 
appetite. These activities included:
 — continued embedding of the Group’s operational resilience programme; 
 — continued review and monitoring of potential impacts from 

macroeconomic and geopolitical events on the Group’s strategy  
and business model;

 — enhancing further the approach to sustainability-related risks and 

associated risk processes;

 — continued focus on technology remediation and enhancement of  

the cyber security framework; and

 — continued monitoring of the Group’s risk profile, against risk appetite, 

across both financial and non-financial risks.

Composition and meetings 
The Committee comprises five independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The skills and experience of each Committee member are provided in 
the Board of Directors section on pages 94 to 97. All Committee 
members have been in place for more than a year.

The Group Chair, Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer, 
Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Group Chief Internal Auditor, are all 
standing attendees at Committee meetings. A member of the Company 
Secretariat is the Secretary to the Committee. In addition to the standing 
attendees, various other members of management are invited to 
present specific matters relevant to the Committee’s remit.

The Board is satisfied that each member of the Committee has the skills 
and experience necessary for the Committee to effectively discharge  
its responsibilities. The Chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees each  
sit on both committees, which ensures appropriate identification and 
management of issues relevant to both committees.

During 2023, the Risk Committee held four regular meetings. In the 
ordinary course of business, the Committee regularly reviews the 
Group’s risk profile, risk appetite and emerging risks. The CRO also 
provides regular updates to the Chair throughout the year.

The Group continues to support  
its key markets and deliver stable 
and resilient services that meet  
our clients’ needs. The Group’s  
risk culture, objectives, appetite, 
governance and operations are 
well established, underpinning  
the whole organisation.

Purpose, responsibility and terms of reference 
The Committee has non-executive responsibility for high-level risk 
related matters and for risk governance. The Committee reviews the risk 
profile of the Group, and its divisions, on a regular basis and comments 
on the adequacy of the processes in place to identify, manage, mitigate 
and report on key risks. It advises the Board on the Company’s overall 
risk appetite, tolerance and strategy, and reviews the adequacy of  
the Enterprise Risk Management Framework and its application to 
decision-making. 

The Committee sets the criteria for the accurate and timely reporting of 
material risks including regular reports on compliance for each regulated 
entity. As part of this mandate, the Committee also regularly reviews 
best practices for enterprise risk management.

Further details on the functions and responsibilities of the Risk 
Committee can be found in the Committee’s terms of reference which 
are reviewed annually and available from the Group Company Secretary,

Summary of the key areas of focus 
During the year, the Risk Committee focused efforts on programmes  
to further embed the Group Enterprise Risk Management Framework 
(ERMF) and further strengthen risk culture across the organisation.  
The Committee prioritised key activities which supported the vision of 
the Group Risk function, enabling the achievement of the 2023 Group 
strategic objectives. These included:
 — enhancing the approach to sustainability-related risks and associated 
risk processes. The Committee also approved the Group sustainability 
risk framework;

 — embedding the operational resilience framework; and
 — creating a stronger risk culture through Group-wide risk awareness 
events and training sessions e.g., 2023 Risk Culture Week at the  
start of the year to raise risk awareness. 

Activities of the Committee 
The Committee established formal agendas covering all responsibilities 
delineated in the Committee’s terms of reference. During the year, the 
Committee discharged these responsibilities with the following activities:
 — Provided robust reviews of principal risks and of emerging risks with  

a focus on:
 — reviewing and recommending to the Board the Group risk appetite, 

including stress tests and challenging the scenario results;

 — monitoring the Group’s risk profile against risk appetite as well  
as progress of remediation activities over the past 12 months,  
and monitored financial resources; 

 — challenging management’s assessment of the Group’s risk  

profile, across both financial and non-financial risk, as well as 
management’s mitigating actions;

 — reviewing and challenging scenario analyses, identification, 

management and mitigation of risks across the Group;

 — reviewing plans to enhance cyber security and operational 

resilience, and reviewing high level focus topics e.g., cyber security, 
cloud risk, greenwashing, US debt ceiling; and

 — reviewing risk events and emerging risk topics throughout the year; 
assessing the potential impacts of the ongoing global geopolitical 
tensions and the evolving financial landscape on the Group’s 
strategy and business model, including: 
 —  Russia/Ukraine, China/Taiwan, Middle East, Sri-Lanka; 
 — the banking crises – Credit Suisse, Silicon Valley Bank,  

US debt ceiling

 — Monitoring compliance in line with the Group risk management 
procedures as described in the section on internal controls on  
page 104 which included:
 — reviewing regulatory compliance reports and the actions in place  

to ensure ongoing compliance;

 — reviewing the adequacy of the Group’s business continuity 

management plans; and

 — reviewing and recommending to the Board the Group risk appetite, 

including stress tests and challenging the scenario results.

Risk management function 
The CRO leads and oversees all aspects of risk management for the 
Group. He reports to the Chief Executive Officer, and also, to ensure 
independence, to the Chair of the Risk Committee. The Committee 
approves the CRO’s remit and ensures that the CRO has the 
independence and resources necessary to perform their duty.  
Group management consults with the Committee on the appointment 
and dismissal of the CRO.

The Committee meets with the CRO without the presence of executive 
management at each Committee meeting.

2024 priorities 
In 2024, the Committee’s priorities include:
 — continued monitoring of the Group’s risk profile against risk appetite 
and oversight of risk mitigation and control enhancement activities;
 — continued monitoring of potential impacts from macroeconomic and 

geopolitical events; and

 — continued oversight of the Group’s risk culture and embedding of the 

Enterprise Risk Management Framework.

Committee effectiveness 
The Committee’s effectiveness was assessed as part of the 2023  
Board and Committee effectiveness review. Further details can be  
found in the Governance section of this report on pages 102 to 103.  
The result of the review was that the Committee is performing well  
and operating effectively.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued

Statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee

I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the  
year ended 31 December 2023. This is my first report since assuming 
the role of Chair of the Remuneration Committee in September last year 
and I would like to thank my predecessor, Cressida Hogg, for her 
leadership of the Committee.

This year we will be asking shareholders to vote on three remuneration 
resolutions at our 2024 AGM:
 — our Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”), which outlines the 

remuneration framework that will apply to our Executive Directors, 
Non-Executive Directors and the Group Chair should it be approved 
by shareholders (set out on pages 127 to 136);

 — our Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out remuneration 

outcomes for 2023 and explains how we intend to apply the Policy  
in 2024 (set out on pages 137 to 153); and

 — our new long-term incentive plan rules (the Equity Incentive Plan or 
EIP), which will replace the existing Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 
which expires this year (further information is provided in the Notice  
of AGM).

This statement on pages 118 to 123 provides context for the decisions 
made by the Committee in the year, summarising in particular the 
proposed changes to our Remuneration Policy and the background and 
rationale for the adjustments. A “Remuneration at a glance” section is 
included after this statement on pages 124 to 126 which summarises 
broader employee reward at LSEG, 2023 remuneration outcomes  
for Executive Directors, and the proposed operation of incentive  
plans in 2024.

2024 Remuneration Policy review
As we signalled in our Directors’ Remuneration Report last year, the 
Committee has conducted a comprehensive review of the existing 
Policy to ensure that it remains fit for purpose so we retain and attract 
the global talent that has delivered the business transformation and 
shareholder value creation to date and who will continue to capture 
significant opportunities in the future.

We are proposing to update the Policy for Executive Directors to  
reflect that:
 — LSEG has transformed and is now a leading global financial markets 
infrastructure and data provider, which is larger, more diversified and 
more complex than at the time of the last material Policy review;
 — the market for our senior leadership team is now a set of global 

companies in similar geographic and business segments as LSEG, 
where pay levels are often significantly higher (further information  
on our global sector peers and the selection approach is set out on 
pages 118 to 119);

 — significant pay compression is now observed within LSEG as a result 
of our need to compete for talent with the largest global players in  
the financial markets infrastructure and data provision sector; and

 — we need to ensure that the LSEG pay structures, measures and 

targets reinforce continuation of the strong performance delivered  
by our exceptional management team in recent years.

As part of the review we consulted extensively with nearly 100 
shareholders, representing approximately 80% of LSEG’s voting rights, 
and proxy agencies. I would like to thank everyone we engaged with for 
their valuable input during this process, which has informed the detail of 
our revised Policy. Overall, the majority of shareholders were supportive 
of our proposals and recognised the rationale of our thinking in light  
of the transformation and high performance of the business, both in 
absolute and relative terms, under our CEO’s leadership, and the need 
for LSEG to compete in a global talent market. 

A summary of the context against which the Committee has reviewed 
the Policy, our rationale for adjusting it and detail of the proposed 
changes is set out below.

Business transformation
Over the last five years, LSEG has transformed in terms of global 
breadth, scope, scale and performance. The business has grown  
from a European regional exchange group into a diversified, global 
provider of financial markets infrastructure and data services. LSEG  
is systemically important in the major geographies of the world, with  
a trusted reputation and strong culture and is making significant 
strategic moves which have most notably included the acquisition  
of Refinitiv and our partnership with Microsoft.

At the heart of LSEG’s transformation has been our executive team, led 
by our CEO, David Schwimmer. The ambitious strategy developed and 
executed by our executive team has changed and strengthened the 
Group, positioning it to grow and succeed, while creating significant 
sustainable long-term shareholder value. Over the course of this 
transformation and David’s tenure (since 1 August 2018), we have:
 — generated total shareholder return of 124% and created £19 billion  

in shareholder value (31 July 2018 – 31 December 2023);

 — increased Adjusted EPS by 118% from 148.7 pence to 323.9 pence  

(31 December 2017 – 31 December 2023);

 — increased our Dividend Per Share 123% from 52 pence to 115 pence  

(31 December 2017 – 31 December 2023);
 — de-levered our Refinitiv acquisition debt; and
 — more than doubled our share price from £43.57 to £92.74  

(1 August 2018 – 31 December 2023).

LSEG is now a heavily tech-oriented organisation with over 25,000 
employees operating across over 60 countries, competing for senior 
leadership talent at a global level. We are also experiencing frequent 
approaches for our talent from global companies, particularly from 
technology and financial services organisations, where pay levels are 
materially higher. This is evident even for our functional leadership roles 
with the departure of our highly regarded CFO, Anna Manz, to join a 
global Swiss-based company and COO, David Shalders, who will join a 
private equity backed financial services company at the end of this year.

Our global sector peers 
With LSEG’s continued transformation, there is a significant step-change 
in our talent requirements and a need to increase the focus on  
how LSEG’s business performance and remuneration compares  
to appropriate sector peers. The Committee therefore undertook  
a comprehensive selection process to identify those companies who 
represent the most appropriate peer group for LSEG. Whilst LSEG’s 
complex end-to-end trade lifecycle offering does not have an exact 
comparator in the market, this selected peer set (shown in the chart on 
page 119) reflects LSEG’s diverse operations, complexity, size and global 
footprint. They represent a comparable group of companies against 
whom we both measure our performance (and which will comprise  
a TSR benchmark for long-term incentive awards going forward)  
and compete for senior level talent and expertise. 

LSEG’s global sector peer group (summarised in the table on page 119) 
consists of organisations of comparable scale and complexity from 
sectors in which LSEG operates, and includes:
 — Financial Markets Infrastructure companies with whom we compete 
and, together with LSEG, constitute the global regulated markets  
that facilitate capital raising, trading and clearing/settlement across  
a range of asset classes; plus

 — global competitors in the provision of data and analytics solutions 
across financial asset classes that support decision-making across 
trading, compliance and risk management in financial markets; plus
 — leading multinational B2B providers of comparable scale to LSEG,  
that provide data and analytics solutions that identify opportunities 
and manage the risks of doing business.

Following extensive analysis, an exclusive group of relevant peers was 
selected from a longer list of firms initially considered.

Statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee continued

Remuneration and performance context
Market pay and performance benchmarking demonstrates that our 
CEO’s pay is significantly below the lower quartile of our sector peers 
(shown above) despite LSEG achieving median to upper quartile  
TSR and EPS performance. This pay-and-performance mismatch has 
persisted over time: over the past four years, David’s cumulative  
pay ranked at the 7th percentile of sector peers, against an EPS 
performance in the 93rd percentile when compared with the same  
peer set (see chart below).

Further, David was the architect of the transformational Refinitiv deal, 
driving the acquisition and successful integration. In addition to the 
strategic benefits with the increased and successful focus on data and 
analytics, the management team has out-delivered on synergies. The 
Group has also continued to grow both organically and through several 
other acquisitions, as well as the strategic partnership with Microsoft, 
which greatly accelerates our growth and transformation plans.

Notes
Company size dimensions: market cap based on spot values for all companies 
on 31 December 2023; revenue and employees based on FY22 ﬁgures to allow 
a like-for-like comparison. 
Company performance: 4-year TSR and EPS performance cover the period ending 
FY2022, aligning with David Schwimmer’s appointment as CEO on 1 August 2018.
CEO pay: 4-year actual pay based on FY2019-FY2022 data as disclosed in the 
summary compensation table (for US peers) and single ﬁgure table (or equivalent, 
for UK/European peers).

The disconnects between (a) our pay and performance, (b) our pay and 
market position, and (c) our pay and calibre of talent, create a substantial 
risk around talent attraction and retention at LSEG.

With David now entering his sixth year as CEO, the Committee believes 
it is important to retain David who will continue to play a critical role  
in leading LSEG through the next phase of transformational growth.

The increasingly competitive global landscape for senior leadership 
talent, particularly those individuals with technology and data 
backgrounds, has resulted in upwards pressure on pay. We are 
experiencing pay compression between our CEO and other recent 
senior hires over the last 12 months, both in absolute terms and 
compared to typical market relativities, as shown below. In order to 
attract the capabilities needed in new senior talent from leading global 
companies, we have had to offer enhanced pay arrangements with  
a significant uplift in quantum when compared to previous pay practices 
and FTSE benchmarks. We have also observed pay disparities when 
recruiting US-based talent with many candidates having existing pay 
levels that are higher than our CEO’s. A particular example of our pay 
disparities with market is that our CEO is paid less than the CEO of  
our US subsidiary, Tradeweb, which has approximately one-third of  
the market capitalisation of LSEG.

With respect to meeting their shared obligations for succession 
planning, the Board and the Committee believe that any credible  
CEO candidate in the future would have to be sourced from the global 
talent market, where the current Policy would be unable to compete in 
terms of expected remuneration packages.

Remuneration Policy proposals
Against this backdrop, the Committee is proposing to update the  
Policy to align it with our transformed business and address our talent 
attraction and retention risks. We believe the Policy must be revised to 
be globally competitive to attract and retain the calibre of talent required 
to continue LSEG’s transformation and deliver our strategic ambition. For 
that reason, the proposed Policy resets Executive Director remuneration 
to align more closely with the median of our global sector peer pay  
(but based on consideration of the remuneration components of salary, 
annual bonus and long-term incentives, in line with the practice of  
UK listed companies). The proposed changes to the Policy and its 
implementation for Executive Directors for 2024 are presented in the 
table opposite:

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued

Policy element Proposal

Salary

 — Increase CEO salary from £1m to £1.375m as part of 

Annual bonus

aligning overall pay more closely with the global sector 
peer median, while adhering to UK governance norms 
around bonus deferral and maximum long-term  
incentive opportunities. 

 — New CFO salary set at £850k to enable recruitment of 

top calibre talent.

 — Increase maximum opportunity from 225% to 300%  
of salary for the CEO. CFO opportunity to remain 
unchanged at 200% of salary.

 — Reduce deferral from 50% to 40% to align with recent 
change applicable below Board level and to align total 
target in-year cash to circa the median of global sector 
peers, who do not typically operate bonus deferral.

 — Re-weight Executive Director bonuses to comprise i) 75% 
financials (currently 60%) inclusive of the introduction of 
an additional measure “Future Growth” (weighted 15%) 
focussing on achievement of future revenue targets ii) 
15% Group Strategic Objectives (GSOs), and iii) 10% 
personal objectives.

Long-term 
incentives

 — Increase long-term incentive opportunity from 300% to 
550% of salary for CEO, and to 400% of salary for CFO.

 — Retain EPS and Relative TSR as vesting measures, 

weighted 60% and 40% respectively (as per current).

 — TSR metric to be split 50/50 on performance vs FTSE100 
(as current) and vs global sector peers (a new, second 
benchmark, based on the companies shown on  
page 119).

 — Introduce payment of dividend equivalents on future 

share awards, aligning to market norms.

 — Update “leaver” provisions: ensure sufficient discretion 
for RemCo to apply “good leaver” status in the event  
of retirement from professional career or to work  
in a governmental capacity or for a non-profit 
organisation, and with agreement from the  
Company/Remuneration Committee.

Minimum 
shareholding 
requirements

 — Increase minimum shareholding requirement from 400% 
to 600% of salary for CEO, and from 300% to 400% of 
salary for CFO, i.e. to be at least equal to the annual 
long-term incentive opportunity.

The revised Policy will strengthen the link between pay, performance 
and value creation for shareholders through the material increases to 
long-term performance-based pay, combined with an increase to the 
minimum shareholding requirements. It is important to highlight that  
the full impacts of the Policy proposals will not be realised until 2029 
when the 2024 long-term incentive award is released from the 
post-vesting holding period. Reflecting shareholder feedback received, 
we have made the performance targets for incentive awards even  
more stretching.

The Committee is considering the CEO remuneration package in the 
very specific circumstances of David Schwimmer, taking into account  
his outstanding past performance and strategic direction.

We believe the proposals are necessary to ensure the remuneration of 
David and the incoming CFO are strongly aligned with the delivery of 
LSEG’s ambitious medium to long-term strategy, as well as giving the 
Committee the ability to recruit the calibre of talent required to continue 
LSEG’s transformation as needed. 

121

Performance in the year
In 2023, LSEG delivered another year of strong financial performance, 
with continued revenue growth across our business divisions despite an 
uncertain macroeconomic environment. We continue to transform our 
business and deliver on our strategy to be the leading global financial 
markets infrastructure and data provider.

Highlights: 
 — Delivered 8.3% income growth on a constant currency basis.  

Growth was 7.7% excluding the Acadia acquisition, towards the  
upper end of the 6%-8% guidance range.

 — Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.6%, slightly ahead of the growth in total 

income. Excluding FX-related balance sheet items, EBITDA margin  
of 47.7%.

 — Exceeded our £400 million runrate cost synergy target 2 years ahead 
of schedule and continued to deliver strongly on our revenue synergy 
programme with £158m runrate synergies delivered to date.

 — Delivered the successful integration and acceleration of Refinitiv: 
2021-2023 total income (excl. recoveries) CAGR of 6.5% is at the 
upper end of acquisition targets.

 — Our medium-term guidance further raises growth aspirations: 

targeting mid-to-high single digit medium term organic growth, 
accelerating after 2024.

 — Making targeted acquisitions: Acadia reinforces our leading position 
in Post Trade Solutions; acquired full control of LCH SA; increased 
ownership of LCH Group.

 — Good progress on Microsoft partnership: first products expected  
in H1 2024, many embedding AI technologies and revolutionising 
industry workflows.

 — Significant shareholder returns: final dividend of 79.3 pence, taking full 
year payout to 115 pence; £1.2 billion returned via buybacks in 2023.

2023 bonus outcomes for Executive Directors
Executive Directors were eligible to receive an annual bonus based on 
meeting or exceeding bonus targets that were set at the beginning  
of the year, looking at the Group’s financial performance, strategic 
objectives and their personal contribution.

The Committee received input from the Risk Committee with regard  
to performance related to risk culture (awareness, transparency and 
accountability) when assessing remuneration decisions.

For FY2023, we exceeded our Group adjusted operating profit (AOP) 
financial target and have outperformed against our strategic objectives. 
In determining the overall outcome of the strategic objectives for the 
FY2023 Group bonus pool, the Committee took into account certain 
factors relating to risk, including compliance risk and resilience, which 
meant that despite the otherwise strong strategic performance achieved 
against the objectives, the Committee determined that, on balance,  
the overall outcome of this component should be 28%. This outturn is 
lower than the previous year’s outturn of 31%. 

As a result of the Group’s strong performance and the personal 
contribution of the Executive Directors, the Committee determined that 
the CEO will be awarded a bonus of 70% of his maximum opportunity. 
Anna Manz resigned as CFO on 25 May 2023 and is therefore not 
eligible to receive a bonus for the 2023 performance year.

Further details on FY2023 performance can be found in the Financial 
Review on pages 44 to 57.

Share plan rules and approvals
The LSEG Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 (or LTIP) approved by 
shareholders in 2014 will expire this year. As a result, we will be seeking 
shareholder approval for a new long-term incentive plan, the Equity 
Incentive Plan (or EIP), at our forthcoming AGM. Further information  
is provided in the Notice of AGM.

London Stock Exchange Group plc  Annual Report 2023GOVERNANCEDirectors’ Remuneration Report continued

Statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee continued

2021 LTIP award outcomes
The AEPS element of the LTIP awards made in 2021 will vest at 100% 
and the Relative TSR element will vest at 0%. These vesting outcomes 
reflect the delivery of AEPS growth of 18.3% CAGR and 8.1% TSR 
performance over the three-year performance period, the latter 
representing 43rd percentile performance relative to the FTSE 100 peer 
group. The TSR position partly reflects the significant growth in the share 
price in the years leading up to the start of the 2021 LTIP performance 
period during which LSEG was consistently upper quartile.

Discretion in relation to incentive outcomes
The incentive outcomes above are reflective of overall Group financial 
and strategic performance, and the Committee determined that no 
discretion should be exercised to adjust the formulaic outcomes.

The Committee reviewed LSEG’s share price performance in 
determining the extent to which the 2021 LTIP award should vest  
and concluded that no windfall gains had occurred.

Operation of 2024 bonus 
The FY2024 Group bonus pool will be determined based on  
Group performance measures weighted 75% on financial measures 
(60% AOP, 15% Future Growth) and 25% on strategic objectives. 

The Executive Directors’ awards are funded from the Group bonus  
pool. Bonus awards for the Executive Directors will be determined in 
accordance with performance measures weighted: 60% against  
Group AOP; 15% against Future Growth; 15% against Group Strategic 
Objectives; and 10% against personal objectives.

Annual bonuses for FY2024 will be awarded in line with our revised 
Policy, subject to shareholder approval. Under the revised Policy,  
60% of any FY2024 bonus payment for Executive Directors would be 
paid in March 2025. The remaining 40% would be deferred into shares 
for a period of three years.

Long-term incentive awards to be made in 2024
Long-term incentive awards will be granted in 2024 in line with our 
revised Policy and under the Equity Incentive Plan, in each case subject 
to shareholder approval.

The Committee has given careful attention to the AEPS element of the 
2024 grant (with a 60% weighting) and, considering internal and external 
forecasts, has set the AEPS targets at 7% to 12.5% CAGR. This means 
that both the threshold and maximum end of the ranges are higher  
than the targets set for the 2023 grant. To achieve maximum vesting,  
an incremental £1.1bn AOP would be required in 2026, equivalent to 
incremental income in the region of £2.05bn, relative to 2023. We 
expect that this AEPS range will be one of the highest, if not the highest, 
in the FTSE 30 and continues to demonstrate LSEG’s commitment to 
setting class-leading, stretching targets. Furthermore, the higher AEPS 
baseline makes AEPS CAGR growth increasingly challenging to achieve 
for LSEG.

For the Relative TSR element (40% weighting), performance will be 
assessed against our global sector peer group (the same sector peers 
we used to benchmark remuneration) and the FTSE 100, each weighted 
50:50. The performance range will be median to upper quartile for both 
peer groups.

The stretching nature of these performance targets set by the Committee 
is noted also in the context of historical grant outcomes; specifically the 
most recent 2020 and 2021 awards which have not vested at maximum 
despite the Group’s strong performance in the period.

Executive Director changes 
Departure terms for Anna Manz
Anna Manz resigned as CFO on 25 May 2023. Following publication of 
the Group’s 2023 Full Year Annual Results on 29 February 2024, she 
will step down from the Board and leave the Group. Her unvested 
incentive awards will be treated in line with the Policy in effect at the 
time of her resignation. Following her resignation, she was not eligible  
to receive a bonus for 2023 or a long-term incentive award for 2024 
and her outstanding LTIP awards lapsed. Anna continued to receive her 
contractual salary, pension allowance and benefits until her termination 
date. Full details are provided on page 146.

Appointment terms for Michel-Alain Proch
As announced on 20 November 2023, Michel-Alain Proch joined  
LSEG on 26 February 2024 and will be appointed to the Board as  
CFO on 1 March 2024. Prior to joining LSEG, Michel-Alain was the  
Group Chief Financial Officer for Publicis Groupe SA and a member  
of their Management Board. 

Michel-Alain will receive a salary of £850,000 and a pension cash 
allowance of 10% of salary (aligned with the wider workforce), along with 
other benefits offered to the wider workforce in the UK. He will also be 
eligible to participate in the Annual Bonus and Equity Incentive Plan 
under the Policy in place for 2024 (subject to shareholder approval at 
the AGM). If the proposed Policy is approved, this includes an annual 
bonus opportunity with a maximum of 200% salary and a maximum 
long-term incentive grant of 400% of salary. Michel-Alain forfeited 
various incentive awards which were inflight at the time of his leaving 
Publicis Groupe SA; LSEG has agreed to compensate for the forfeited 
amounts partly through an enhancement to Michel-Alain’s FY2024 
bonus opportunity. The combined regular FY2024 bonus (based on  
a pro-rated opportunity for the time served over FY2024) plus the 
compensatory amount will mean that his overall maximum FY2024 
bonus opportunity will be equal to 200% of his full-time salary.  
Michel-Alain will also be granted awards to compensate for other 
remuneration forfeited at Publicis Groupe SA. Full details are provided 
on pages 146.

Given Michel-Alain is relocating from Paris to London to take on the CFO 
role, LSEG will be providing immigration, relocation and tax/filing support 
in accordance with LSEG’s usual practices and approved Policy.

Committee effectiveness
The Committee’s effectiveness was assessed as part of the 2023  
Board and Committee effectiveness review. The result of the review  
was that the Committee is performing well and operating effectively. 
Further details can be found in the Governance section of this report  
on pages 102 to 103. 

Concluding remarks
The intent of this statement and the wider Directors’ Remuneration 
Report is to explain the Group’s approach to remuneration, which takes 
into account best practice and market trends while continuing to support 
the commercial needs of the Group, the interests of shareholders  
and of all other stakeholders. The Committee continues to place great 
importance on ensuring that there is a clear link between pay and 
performance, including a focus on culture, adherence to the Group’s  
risk framework, and that our remuneration outcomes are reflective of 
this wider context. 

Finally, I would like to reiterate my thanks to Cressida Hogg for the 
significant contribution she has made during her tenure as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and for supporting me with the transition 
process. I would also like to thank my fellow Committee members and 
all internal and external stakeholders for their valuable input over the 
course of the year. We look forward to your support of our proposals  
at the forthcoming AGM.

William Vereker
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
28 February 2024

This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to  
The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended), and the relevant sections of 
the Listing Rules.

Remuneration at a glance 

Broader employee reward at LSEG
The Committee has responsibility for overseeing arrangements for all of our people and reviews broader workforce policies and practices  
in order to support decisions on executive pay. Our single aligned global reward framework was developed to create a transparent,  
performance-driven approach for our Group. This framework helps to unify and drive our organisation forward and is based on the  
following principles: (i) Performance-led; (ii) Competitive; (iii) Transparent and Equitable; and (iv) Inclusive and Consistent.

Salary
How we reward our colleagues
Salaries are normally reviewed annually by taking into account a range of factors and are reflective of individual 
roles, job-related knowledge, skills, commensurate experience, and the wider market.

In 2024, 91% of employees will receive a salary increase. As inflation and cost of living pressures remain high  
in some of LSEG’s key locations, we continue with the principle of allocating proportionately more of our 2024 
salary budget to those most impacted, specifically prioritising those in early career stages in the UK, US and 
countries with the highest inflation. 

For senior career stages, the approach for our 2024 annual salary review is consistent with that taken in the 
2023 review cycle. For the UK and US, increases are focused on those with expanded roles and those whose 
pay is low versus internal peers and/or the external market.

Executive Director alignment
The review of Executive Director 
salaries takes into account the  
same factors considered for the 
wider workforce.

Benefits
How we reward our colleagues
A market-aligned benefits plan is offered in each key country in which we operate. For the UK, a flexible  
benefits plan is offered, in which individuals have certain core benefits (such as private medical, life assurance 
and income protection) together with a cash allowance which can be spent on elective benefits (such as 
additional medical, life or dental cover).

Colleagues receive an annual pension allowance, invested in the Company’s defined contribution plan or 
provided as a cash allowance.

Executive Director alignment
Executive Directors are eligible for  
a range of market-aligned benefits 
and receive a pension allowance  
in line with the wider workforce.

Executive Director alignment
The annual bonus plan for the 
broader employee population 
considers the same performance 
conditions as the Executive 
Directors’ bonus plan and is linked 
to both Group performance and 
individual performance.

Annual bonuses for Executive 
Directors are subject to 40% deferral 
into shares for a period of three years.

Executive Director alignment
Executive Directors are eligible for 
long-term incentive awards (subject 
to stretching performance targets 
over three years). An additional 
two-year post-vesting holding period 
applies to Executive Directors.

Executive Director alignment
Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate in LSEG’s all-employee 
share plans on the same terms as  
all other eligible employees.

Bonus
How we reward our colleagues
80% of colleagues participate in LSEG’s annual performance-related bonus based on Group, divisional  
(where applicable) and personal performance against goals. Remaining colleagues participate in other 
performance-based plans such as sales incentives.

Annual bonuses for Group leaders are subject to 40% deferral into shares, vesting in equal tranches over  
three years. 

Share incentive plans
How we reward our colleagues
Performance share awards (subject to stretching performance targets over three years) are granted to  
senior leaders who have the ability to significantly influence the long-term performance of the Group.

Group Directors are eligible for restricted share awards aligned with long-term Group performance and 
shareholder interests; vesting in equal tranches over three years.

LSEG employee share plans
How we reward our colleagues
Our all-employee share plans offer employees around the globe the opportunity to invest and share in the  
Group’s future success. All permanent UK and Sri Lanka employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave 
Plan (or, in the case of Sri Lankan employees, an equivalent international plan). There is also a SharePurchase 
Plan, which is designed to provide share options to people who are not based in the UK or Sri Lanka.

In 2023, we have reinforced the benefits of share ownership throughout the organisation by enhancing the 
value of our all-employee plans (doubling the SharePurchase benefit and increasing the contribution cap on  
the Sharesave plan), ensuring an opportunity increase for all. 

Following rollout of the upgraded plans, participation has increased by 19.6% with over 7,600 employees across 
31 countries enrolled in our all-employee plans. LSEG now has more employees participating in all-employee 
share plans than total employee numbers prior to the transaction with Refinitiv.

Operation of 2024 incentive plans and alignment to strategy
The performance measures used in our incentives are directly aligned to the Group’s KPIs and strategic priorities. 

FY2024 Group Bonus Pool
Reflecting shareholder feedback received during the Policy review, the 2024 design includes increasing the weighting of financial measures 
within the bonus pool from 60% to 75%, incorporating both AOP and Future Growth measures. AOP is a key profitability measure for the 
Group and continues to be the main financial measure for annual bonus plan purposes. The additional measure “Future Growth” focuses on 
achievement of future revenue targets. The Group Strategic Objectives focus on the delivery of key strategic objectives, measured through 
achievement of stretching targets against externally reported KPIs.

Remuneration Policy Report

Our Remuneration Policy was last subject to a binding shareholder vote 
at the 2023 AGM and was passed with 97.5% support. This section sets 
out our revised Policy which will be subject to shareholder approval at 
the AGM in April 2024, and if approved, will apply for a period of up to 
three years.

Remuneration Policy table
The revised Policy is set out in the table on pages 129 to 131 and 
includes the following changes to our existing Policy. The rationale  
for the proposed changes is provided in the Statement by the Chair  
of the Remuneration Committee, set out on pages 118 to 123.

Policy element Revision

Annual bonus

 — Increase maximum opportunity from 225% to 300% of 

salary for the CEO. CFO opportunity to remain 
unchanged at 200% of salary.

 — Reduce deferral from 50% to 40% to align with recent 
change applicable below Board level and to align total 
target in-year cash to around the median of global sector 
peers, who do not typically operate bonus deferral.

 — Re-weight Executive Director bonuses to comprise at 
least 70% financials (currently at least 50% under  
existing Policy and 60% in practice for FY2023).

Long-term 
incentives

 — Increase long-term incentive opportunity (granted under 
the EIP) from 300% to 550% of salary for CEO, and to 
400% for CFO.

 — Leaver provisions updated to provide sufficient 

discretion for RemCo to apply ‘good leaver’ status in  
the event of retirement from professional career or to 
work in a governmental capacity or for a non-profit 
organisation, and with agreement from the Company/
Remuneration Committee.

Shareholding 
requirements

 — Increase shareholding requirement from 400% to 600% 
of salary for CEO, and from 300% to 400% of salary for 
CFO, i.e. to be at least equal to the annual long-term 
incentive opportunity.

The Remuneration Policy is designed to support the long-term interests 
of the Group. The Group is committed to paying for performance, 
rewarding the senior management team only when performance against 
stretching targets is achieved. Each year the remuneration framework 
and the packages of the Executive Directors and members of the 
Executive Committee are reviewed by the Committee to ensure that 
they continue to achieve this objective. 

The Committee takes into account multiple reference points when 
setting pay including our global sector peer set for Executive Directors 
and Executive Committee members where available; and with FTSE 30 
practices guiding the structure of pay. When this data is not readily 
available, other reference points such as the FTSE 100 and the broader 
Financial Services/international exchange groups and financial markets 
infrastructure sectors are considered. 

The Committee takes the following areas into account when reviewing 
the policy:
 — a focus on shareholder value;
 — the size, scope and complexity of the Group;
 — the performance of the Group and market positioning against 

appropriate comparators, including sector peers and companies in 
the FTSE 30;

 — the need to attract and retain senior management from the global 

market in which we compete for talent;
 — corporate governance developments;
 — remuneration arrangements for the wider workforce;
 — the Group’s intent to be mindful of best practice as expressed by 
institutional shareholders and their representative bodies; and

 — the unique position of the Group at the centre of global  

financial markets.

Remuneration Policy Report continued

The principles prescribed by the UK Corporate Governance Code are taken into account by the Committee in determining the Remuneration Policy. 
Details of how these are addressed are provided below.

Principle

How the Committee has addressed the principles

Clarity

 — The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration arrangements in the policy are transparent, comprising elements that are commonplace 

in the market and best practice remuneration provisions.

 — The Committee is committed to transparent and constructive engagement with all its stakeholders and consults with major shareholders 
and investor bodies to ensure the rationale for any significant changes proposed to the operation of the policy is fully understood and 
provide the opportunity for feedback to inform our decision-making process.

Simplicity

 — The operation of the Annual Bonus and the design of plans like the EIP is well understood by stakeholders and aligned to Group strategy 

and the UK market best practice approach.

Risk

 — The Committee is satisfied that the policy ensures that the risks from excessive rewards and target-based incentive plans are  

mitigated by:
 — Setting defined limits on the maximum awards which can be earned
 — Ensuring stretching yet achievable targets are set for incentive plans
 — Requiring the deferral of a substantial proportion of the incentives into shares for a material period of time
 — Aligning the performance conditions of incentives with the strategy and business model of the Group
 — Ensuring the Committee has overriding discretion to depart from formulaic outcomes and the ability to apply malus and clawback to 

incentives where appropriate

 — The Remuneration Committee also receives input from the Risk Committee with regard to performance related to risk culture  

(awareness, transparency and accountability) when assessing remuneration decisions.

Predictability

 — Illustrations of the potential outcomes under the Policy are provided on page 136. Defined limits on the maximum awards which can be 
earned are also disclosed on pages 130 and 131. Vesting levels are driven by performance outcomes against stretching targets that are 
set for incentive plans.

Proportionality

 — In line with our pay for performance model, the majority of Executive Director pay is performance-based. The performance metrics used 

Alignment  
to culture

in our incentive plans support the delivery of the Group’s strategy, as well as short-term and long-term financial targets.

 — Relevant market peers are used to assess business performance and inform reward.
 — A robust target-setting process is carried out each year, taking into account internal and external forecasts and reference points, to 

ensure stretching yet achievable targets are set for incentive plans.

 — The Committee also has overriding discretion to adjust incentive outcomes based on a broad set of factors to ensure they fairly and 

accurately reflect the Group’s performance over the relevant period and wider circumstances.

 — The Group bonus pool assessment will continue to be based on the achievement of financial and strategic goals of the Group,  

including cultural and ESG objectives.

 — The Committee places great importance on ensuring our pay policies and incentives support the desired culture and behaviours of the 
Group. Personal performance is assessed against contribution to the strategic objectives, including cultural objectives, and against 
role-related goals and expected behaviours, taking into account both what has been achieved and how the individuals achieved  
their targets.

 — All awards are discretionary and contingent on the requisite standards of personal behaviours; poor behaviour/risk management  

could result in a zero payout. 

The Committee recognises and manages any conflict of interest when receiving views from Executive Directors or senior management on executive 
remuneration and no individual is involved in deciding their own remuneration.

Policy table for Executive Directors

Salary 

Benefits

Purpose and link to strategy
Provides a core element of remuneration which reflects the responsibilities 
of the role.

Purpose and link to strategy
Provides local market-competitive benefits and support the wellbeing  
of employees. 

Enables the recruitment and retention of individuals of the calibre required 
to execute the Group’s strategy.

Operation
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually by taking into account  
a range of factors, including:
 — size and scope of the role;
 — size, complexity and global breadth of the organisation;
 — skills and experience of the individual;
 — market competitiveness/relative positioning;
 — performance of the Group and of the individual;
 — wider market and economic conditions; and
 — level of increases being made across the Group.

Maximum Opportunity
There is no defined maximum salary but the maximum salary for a given 
executive is set by the Committee.

Increases are determined based on the factors described above. 

Operation
A market-aligned benefits plan is offered in each key country in which we 
operate. For the UK, a flexible benefits plan is offered, in which individuals 
have certain core benefits (such as private medical, life assurance and 
income protection) together with a taxable cash allowance which can be 
spent on elective benefits (such as additional medical, life or dental cover).

Car transportation may also be provided for Executive Directors  
where appropriate.

Due to the high profile of the Group, the Committee reserves the right to 
provide our executives with the appropriate level of security arrangements 
to allow them to perform their duties in the safest possible conditions.

Benefits are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain affordable and 
competitive. The Committee retains the discretion to provide additional 
benefits as appropriate – for example, relocation and other allowances 
including expatriate assistance, housing and school fees for a finite period, 
tax preparation and filing assistance and return flights back to the home 
country for the executive and their family. Repatriation costs are met by  
the Company if employment is terminated by the Company, other than  
for just cause.

Where necessary any benefits may be grossed up for taxes.

Executives are eligible to participate in the Group’s HMRC tax favoured 
Sharesave Plan (or international equivalent) on the same basis as  
other employees. 

Executive Directors are covered by the Directors’ and Officers’ insurance 
and indemnification.

Maximum Opportunity
There is no defined maximum. 

Benefits plans are set at (what are in the Committee’s opinion) reasonable 
levels in order to be market competitive for their local jurisdiction and are 
dependent on individual circumstances.

Participation in the Save As You Earn Option Scheme (or international 
equivalent) is capped at the same level as all other participants, which is 
determined by the Company within the parameters of applicable legislation.

consideration to local employment legislation, local market practices  
and the cost of the arrangement.

Maximum Opportunity
The maximum annual pension contribution/cash allowance for Executive 
Directors is 10% of salary (except where required by local market practice 
where levels could be set at a higher or lower amount). This is a rate  
aligned with the wider workforce in the UK.

The Group operates a Group-wide bonus pool which is funded based on 
the achievement of financial and strategic goals of the Group. Allocations  
to individual Executive Directors are made from this pool based on the 
Committee’s assessment of their personal performance, taking into account 
the Group’s financial and strategic performance and the achievement of  
any personal objectives related to their role.

Performance targets are reviewed and set by the Committee at the 
beginning of each performance year.

Awards are determined by the Committee after the year-end based upon 
the actual performance against these targets. 

The Committee applies judgement where necessary to ensure approved 
pay-out levels are reflective of actual, overall performance and has the 
ability to exercise discretion in adjusting the formulaic outcome of incentives 
to ensure the outcome is reflective of the performance of the Company and 
the individual over the period.
 — 40% of the annual bonus will be subject to mandatory deferral, normally 

for a period of three years. 

 — Bonus deferral will be 100% into shares. 
 — Dividends (or equivalents) may be paid in respect of deferred shares  

on vesting.

 — Unvested deferred awards are subject to malus provisions as described 

below. Paid bonuses and vested deferred awards are subject to clawback 
as described below.

Maximum Opportunity
Maximum annual bonus opportunity of 300% of salary for CEO and 200%  
of salary for other Executive Directors.

Performance Measures
Based on a combination of financial (e.g. adjusted operating profit and future 
growth), strategic and personal performance targets. Strategic objectives 
include key targets and areas of focus, which are set annually, and 
measured through achievement of stretching targets against externally 
reported KPIs. Whilst not an exclusive list, examples of strategic objectives 
can include culture, resilience, customer, efficiency, and sustainability. These 
strategic objectives also impact on financial results in the medium term. 

The Committee will set the detail and mix of performance measures, targets 
and weighting based on the strategic objectives at the start of each year.  
At least 70% of the annual bonus pool and Executive Directors’ bonuses  
will be based on performance against financial measures.

No bonuses are paid for below threshold performance. The Committee  
may award any amount between zero and 100% of the maximum opportunity.

Long-term incentives (under Long Term Incentive Plan  
2014 and Equity Incentive Plan)

Share ownership

Purpose and link to strategy
Incentivises performance over the longer term through the award of 
performance-related shares.

Aligns reward with long-term, sustainable Group performance and  
a focus on shareholder value.

Operation
 — Awards of shares (or equivalent) are granted annually (to be granted 

under the EIP from 2024 onwards).

 — Awards vest subject to performance targets assessed over a 

performance period, normally of at least three financial years with an 
additional holding period of two years. The Committee has discretion  
to set different performance periods and holding periods if it considers 
them to be appropriate. 

 — The Committee shall determine the extent to which the performance 
measures have been met. The Committee may make adjustments to 
performance targets if an event occurs which makes, at the Committee’s 
determination, an adjustment appropriate. The performance targets will 
be at least as challenging as the ones originally set.

 — The Committee has the ability to exercise discretion in adjusting the 

formulaic outcome of incentives to ensure the outcome is reflective of  
the performance of the Company and the individual over the period.

 — Dividends (or equivalents) may be awarded on vesting. Unvested awards 

are subject to a malus provision and vested awards are subject to 
clawback, as described below.

Purpose and link to strategy
Ensures alignment with shareholders’ interests.

Operation
Executive Directors are expected to build up share ownership over a period 
of five years from appointment. The minimum shareholding requirement is 
600 per cent of base salary for the CEO and 400 per cent of base salary for 
other Executive Directors. 

Executive Directors are expected to hold 100% of their minimum 
shareholding requirement for two years post-departure. 

In cases where the individual has not had sufficient time to build up  
share ownership to meet the minimum shareholding requirement,  
the post-employment shareholding requirement will be based on their 
actual level of shareholding on departure.

The Committee has discretion to vary or waive part or all of the post-
employment shareholding requirement in exceptional circumstances.

Maximum Opportunity
Maximum awards of up to 550% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer  
and 400% of salary for other Executive Directors.

Maximum Opportunity
N/a

Performance Measures
The Committee determines performance targets each year to ensure that 
the targets are stretching and support value creation for shareholders while 
remaining motivational for management. 

Vesting of awards is subject to achievement of total shareholder return  
and other financial performance targets. Any one measure will not exceed 
two-thirds of the award. 

For each performance element, achievement of the threshold performance 
level will result in no more than 25 per cent of the maximum award paying 
out. For achievement of the maximum performance level, 100% of the 
maximum pays out. Normally, there is straight-line vesting between  
these points.

Notes to the Policy Table
Selection of performance measures
Performance targets are set by the Committee to be both stretching and 
achievable, taking into account the Group’s strategic priorities and the 
economic landscape.

The performance measures that are used for our annual bonus  
and long-term incentive awards have been chosen to support the 
Group’s strategy. For the annual bonus plan, the Committee continues  
to believe that it is appropriate to use a balance between financial 
targets, strategic objectives and personal performance objectives.

Performance Measures
N/a

The Committee considers that the measures to be used for long-term 
incentive awards going forwards, i.e. relative TSR against sector peers 
and the FTSE 100 index, and adjusted EPS, are currently the most 
appropriate measures of long-term performance for the Group. The 
Committee reviews the measures, weightings and targets for long-term 
incentive awards on an annual basis, to ensure their continued suitability 
and to ensure they are sufficiently stretching for LSEG.

Malus and clawback provisions
Malus and clawback provisions apply to all share incentive awards 
granted to Executive Directors. Clawback provisions apply to annual 
bonuses paid to Executive Directors.

In respect of future awards under the EIP, the malus provisions allow  
the Committee in its absolute discretion to determine, at any time prior 
to the payment or vesting of an award, to reduce, cancel or impose 
further conditions in certain circumstances, including; 

(a)  material misstatement or restatement in the Company’s or any 
member of the Group’s audited financial accounts (other than  
as a result of a change in accounting practice);

(b)  the negligence, fraud or serious misconduct of an individual,  

or fraud or serious misconduct with the knowledge of a participant;

(c)  conduct by an individual which results in, or is or was reasonably 

likely to result in (whether or not such result has transpired  
e.g., if undiscovered and/or if no mitigating steps had been taken):
(i)  significant reputational damage to the Company, any member  
of the Group or to a relevant business unit (as appropriate);

(ii)  a material adverse effect on the financial position of the 

Company, any member of the Group or to a relevant business 
unit (as appropriate); 

(iii)  a material downturn in the financial performance of the 

Company, any member of the Group or to a relevant business 
unit (as appropriate);

(iv)  a material corporate failure of the Company, any member of  
the Group or to a relevant business unit (as appropriate);
(v)  a material adverse effect on the business opportunities and 
prospects for sustained performance or profitability of the 
Company, any member of the Group or relevant business unit  
(as appropriate); or

(vi)  a material failure of risk management in the Company,  

any member of the Group or to a relevant business unit  
(as appropriate),

or an individual being (or having been): a member of; an employee 
of; or responsible for, a business unit, the Company or a member of 
the Group that suffers (or may or could reasonably have suffered) 
any of the same;

(d)  where the grant, vesting, exercise, payment or release of an award 
would not be sustainable according to the financial situation of the 
Group as a whole nor justified on the basis of the performance of  
the Group, the relevant business unit and the relevant individual;

(e)  conduct or behaviour by an individual that, following an investigation, 
is reasonably considered by the Committee to constitute a breach of 
the Company’s values and/or standards as stipulated by the Group’s 
Code of Conduct or any of the Company’s policies, procedures or 
any provision of any staff handbook in force from time to time;

(i)  any other circumstances that the Committee, in exercising 

appropriate discretion and acting fairly and reasonably, considers to 
be similar in nature or effect to those above.

Clawback provisions allow the Committee in its absolute discretion to 
claw back from individuals some or all of the vested EIP awards or  
paid bonus in the same circumstances outlined for malus above. 

Clawback will normally apply for a period of three years following 
vesting of share awards and/or payment of cash bonus unless the 
Committee determines otherwise.

Similar but not identical malus and/or clawback triggers apply to existing 
awards under other LSEG discretionary share incentive plans, and to 
annual bonuses.

Freezing provisions
Under the EIP, the Committee may also exercise its discretion to “freeze” 
an award (e.g. suspend grant, vesting, exercise or delivery of an award): 

(a)  where an individual is subject to any investigation, disciplinary 

process or disciplinary sanction; 

(b)  any circumstances in which the Committee may apply its discretion 

to apply malus/clawback (as explained above); or 

(c)  in any other circumstances that the Committee, in exercising its 

discretion and acting fairly and reasonably, considers appropriate. 

Recruitment policy
When determining the remuneration package for a newly appointed 
Executive Director, the Committee would seek to apply the following 
principles:
 — The package should be market competitive to facilitate the 

recruitment of individuals of sufficient calibre required by the Group. 
Consistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee 
would intend to pay no more than it believes is necessary to secure 
the required talent.

 — The ongoing remuneration package would normally include the key 
elements on the same terms as those set out in the policy table for 
Executive Directors.

 — The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be awarded 
on recruitment (excluding any buy-outs referred to below) is 850% of 
salary. Incentive awards made in the first year of appointment may be 
subject to different performance measures and targets appropriate  
to the newly recruited Executive Director.

 — Recognising that the Group competes for talent in the international 
financial services sector, on an exceptional basis, the Committee  
has the ability to include other elements of pay which it feels  
are appropriate taking into account the specific commercial 
circumstances (e.g., for an interim appointment). However, this  
would remain subject to the limit on variable remuneration set  
out above. The rationale for any such component would be 
appropriately disclosed.

(f)  unreasonable failure by an individual to protect the interests of the 

 — In addition, where an individual forfeits arrangements as a result of 

Group’s stakeholders; 

(g)  where a participant ceases to be an employee by reason of their 
retirement (as determined by the Committee) at any time prior to 
payment or vesting, but becomes employed in an executive role by 
any entity other than a role for which they receive no remuneration;

(h)  an error in assessing any performance conditions applicable to an 

award or in the information or assumptions on which the award was 
granted, vests or is exercised, paid or released; or

appointment, the Committee may offer a buy-out, in such form as the 
Committee considers appropriate taking into account all relevant 
factors which may include the vehicle, expected value and timing  
of forfeited opportunities. Any such buy-out will be limited to the 
commercial value of payments and awards forfeited by the individual.

 — Where an Executive Director is required to relocate from their home 
location to take up their role, the Committee may provide reasonable 
relocation assistance and other allowances including expatriate 
assistance. Global relocation support (normally for up to five years) 
and any associated costs or benefits (including but not limited to 
housing, school fees, tax preparation and filing assistance and flights 
back to the home country) may also be provided if business needs 
require it. Should the executive’s employment be terminated without 
cause by the Group, repatriation costs will be met by the Group.
 — In the event that an internal candidate is promoted to the Board, 

legacy terms and conditions would normally be honoured, including 
pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards.

 — The remuneration package for a newly appointed Non-Executive 
Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the 
policy table for Non-Executive Directors (see page 135).

Service contracts and payments for departing Directors
The Group’s current policy is that Executive Directors’ service 
agreements should have notice periods that are no longer than  
12 months. The Group may terminate an Executive Director’s service 
agreement by making a payment in lieu of notice of a sum equal to 
salary, pension, flexible benefits allowance, and life and medical 
insurance (but excluding bonus and share incentives) in respect of  
any unexpired period of notice, plus any accrued unused holiday 
entitlement. Consideration will be given to appropriate mitigation terms 
(including payments in instalments) to reduce payments in lieu of notice 
made on termination in the event of the Executive Director commencing 
alternative employment, being appointed as a Non-Executive Director  
or providing services pursuant to a consultancy agreement in the  
period that would have been served as notice following the Executive 
Director’s departure.

Treatment of variable incentives
Annual bonus 
Individuals may be considered for an annual bonus in respect of the 
period prior to cessation. Any award would be at the discretion of the 
Committee, subject to the Executive Director’s performance and period 
of employment and subject to performance targets in the usual way.

Deferred Bonus Plan
For good leavers, awards will usually vest at the normal vesting date, 
although the Committee may determine that awards vest on cessation 
of employment. Awards will normally vest in full for a good leaver,  
but the Committee has discretion to pro-rate the award if appropriate  
to do so. If the vesting of a good leaver’s award(s) is required to be 
accelerated due to local law requirements (including tax law), the 
Committee would ordinarily impose a post-vesting holding period on  
the resulting net-of-tax shares for the balance of the original vesting 
period, during which the leaver would not be permitted to sell or transfer 
those shares. Good leavers are those who cease to be an employee of 
a member of the Group by reason of death, injury, disability, ill-health, 
redundancy, the sale of the individual’s employing business or the 
transfer of the Company out of the Group, or any other reason which  
the Committee decides in its discretion (having regard to a range of 
relevant factors including the Executive Director’s performance, length 
of service and circumstances of their departure), and retirement from  
a professional career or to work in a governmental capacity or for  
a non-profit organisation and with agreement from the Company/
Committee will also be an express good leaver reason.

Where an individual is not considered to be a good leaver, unvested 
awards will lapse. Where an individual is summarily dismissed, all awards 
will lapse.

The Group may pay an Executive Director’s reasonable legal fees for 
receiving advice in connection with their employment or its termination.

Deferred unvested awards are subject to malus and vested awards are 
subject to clawback.

The lawful termination mechanisms described above are without 
prejudice to the Group’s ability in appropriate circumstances to 
terminate in breach of the notice period referred to above, and thereby 
to be liable for damages to the Executive Director. Liquidated damages 
clauses are not used.

In the event of termination by the Group, an Executive Director may  
be paid an amount in respect of any statutory and/or contractual  
claims they may have in connection with their employment and/or  
its termination. Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance and an 
indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the Group’s 
Articles of Association are provided to the Executive Directors for  
the duration of their employment and for a minimum of seven years 
following termination.

The Committee considers that this is consistent with current best 
practice and this approach will generally be adopted for new 
appointments. Where appropriate and when recruiting non-UK based 
Directors, the Committee may agree different terms based on local  
legal requirements or market practice.

Long Term Incentive Plan 2014/Equity Incentive Plan
For good leavers, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date 
and following the end of the performance period, unless the Committee 
determines that awards should vest following cessation of employment. 
The two-year post-vesting holding period following the end of the 
performance period will normally continue to apply unless the 
Committee determines otherwise. If the vesting of a good leaver’s 
award(s) is required to be accelerated due to local law requirements 
(including tax law), the Committee would ordinarily impose a post-
vesting holding period on the resulting net-of-tax shares for the balance 
of the original vesting period, during which the leaver would not be 
permitted to sell or transfer those shares. Vesting will be subject to 
performance and unless the Committee determines otherwise (or that 
another basis of reduction is appropriate) pro-rated for time in 
employment. Good leavers are those who cease to be an employee of 
a member of the Group by reason of death, injury, disability, ill-health, 
redundancy, and the sale of the individual’s employing business or 
transfer of the Company out of the Group, any other reason which the 
Committee decides in its discretion, having regard to a range of relevant 
factors including the Executive Director’s performance, length of service 
and circumstances of their departure, and (in the case of the Equity 
Incentive Plan) retirement from professional career or to work in  
a governmental capacity or for a non-profit organisation and with 
agreement from the Company/Committee is also now included as  
an express good leaver reason.

Where an individual is not considered to be a good leaver, unvested 
awards will lapse.

Unvested awards are subject to malus and vested awards are subject to 
clawback as detailed above.

Buy-out awards
If a departing Executive Director holds a buy-out award granted to  
them in connection with their appointment, that award will be treated  
in accordance with its terms.

Detailed share plan provisions
Share awards are subject to the terms of the relevant plan rules under 
which the award has been granted. The Committee may adjust or 
amend awards only in accordance with the provisions of the plan rules. 
This includes making adjustments to awards to reflect certain corporate 
events, including a variation in the Company’s share capital, a demerger 
or a special dividend. In change of control circumstances, all LTIP and 
EIP awards will normally vest on an accelerated basis to the extent that 
the performance conditions are satisfied, and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, subject to time pro-rating. Deferred Bonus 
awards will normally vest in full. The Committee may also allow or 
require some or all of an award to be exchanged if not yet vested.

Individual terms
David Schwimmer entered into a service agreement with the Group on 
12 April 2018 and was appointed with effect from 1 August 2018. David 
Schwimmer’s service agreement may be terminated by either party 
giving at least 12 months’ notice. Alternatively, the Group may terminate 
the contract by payment in lieu of notice of a sum equal to 12 months’ 
salary, pension, flexible benefits allowance, and life and private medical 
insurance (but excluding bonus, share incentives and car transportation). 
Any payment in lieu of notice will be paid in equal monthly instalments 
from the date of termination of the employment. Should Mr Schwimmer 
commence alternative employment, be appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director or provide services pursuant to a consultancy agreement in the 
relevant period (of 12 months) following his departure from the Group, 
each remaining instalment will be reduced by one-twelfth of the annual 
remuneration earned from the alternative employment, directorship or 
consultancy arrangement. Payments of the instalments may be required 
to be deferred until six months after termination by US tax rules applying 
to Mr Schwimmer. To the extent that any payment or benefits payable  
to Mr Schwimmer under his service agreement or under any bonus or 
share incentive plan would be subject to US excise tax, the payments 
and benefits may be reduced if this would result in Mr Schwimmer 
receiving a greater after-tax amount than if the benefits were not 
reduced. On termination (other than by reason of summary dismissal)  
Mr Schwimmer will be eligible to receive a pro-rata bonus for the  
year in which his employment is terminated subject to Group and 
personal performance.

Michel-Alain Proch entered into a service agreement with the  
Group dated 1 November 2023 and was appointed with effect from  
26 February 2024. Michel-Alain Proch’s service agreement may be 
terminated by either party giving at least 12 months’ notice. Alternatively, 
the Group may terminate the contract by payment in lieu of notice of a 
sum equal to 12 months’ salary, pension, wellbeing and flexible benefits 
allowance, and life and private medical insurance (but excluding bonus 
and share incentives). Any payment in lieu of notice will be paid in equal 
monthly instalments from the date of termination of the employment. 
Should Mr Proch commence alternative employment, be appointed as  
a Non-Executive Director or provide services pursuant to a consultancy 
agreement in the relevant period (of 12 months) following his departure 
from the Group, each remaining instalment will be reduced by one-
twelfth of the annual remuneration earned from the alternative 
employment, directorship or consultancy arrangement. On termination 
(other than by reason of summary dismissal) Mr Proch will be eligible  
to receive a pro-rata bonus for the year in which his employment is 
terminated subject to Group and personal performance.

Remuneration policy for other employees and consideration
of wider employee remuneration
The Committee has responsibility for overseeing arrangements for all 
employees and reviews broader workforce policies and practices in 
order to support decisions on executive pay.

Paying our employees fairly relative to their role, skills, experience and 
performance is central to our approach to remuneration, and our reward 
framework and policies support us in doing this. Our Group-wide reward 
framework establishes a transparent and robust compensation structure, 
elements and leverage for each career stage in the organisation, 
providing the Committee with oversight of workforce remuneration.

The Committee places great importance on ensuring our pay policies 
and incentives support the desired culture and behaviours of the Group. 
As detailed in the “Annual bonus operation” section on page 143, bonus 
awards for our Group Executive team as well as our Executive Directors 
are determined in accordance with performance against Group financial 
performance, Group strategic objectives and personal objectives. This 
provides the Committee with greater structure in determining the bonus 
of senior management as well as allowing for a greater focus on culture 
and behaviours.

The Remuneration Policy for senior executives and other employees  
is determined based on similar principles to Executive Directors.  
For roles below the main Board, the exact structure and balance  
are tailored based on various factors including the scale, scope or 
responsibility of the role, development within a role and/or significant 
market movement. The Committee reviews and comments on the salary, 
bonus and long-term incentive awards of the senior executives 
immediately below Board level and approves the overall design and 
distribution of incentive awards available to all employees, including 
share-based plans.

The approach in respect of base salary and benefits is generally 
consistent across the organisation. Executive Directors’ and other  
senior managers’ remuneration includes a greater proportion of 
performance-related pay when compared to other employees.  
The Committee considers this is essential to differentiate levels of 
responsibility and align pay to sustainable long-term performance  
and shareholders’ interests.

The majority of employees are eligible to participate in the annual  
bonus plan which is subject to similar metrics to those used for the 
Executive Directors. Opportunities vary by career stage. Employees  
not participating in the annual bonus typically participate in another 
incentive plan. For example, some sales employees participate in sales 
compensation plans rather than the annual bonus plan.

Deferral of a portion of the annual bonus is operated for our Executive 
Director, Group Executive and Group Leader populations. 40% of the 
annual bonus for our Executive Directors is deferred into shares for a 
period of three years. Below Board, our Group Executives and Group 
Leaders defer 40% of their annual bonus, normally vesting in equal 
tranches over three years; for participants in the Co-invest Plan, their 
deferred bonus vests after three years. Participants in the Co-invest  
Plan invest their deferred bonus into shares and receive a 2:1 company 
match; performance measures and vesting on the match mirror those of 
long-term incentive awards. The operation of bonus deferral reinforces 
the alignment of the pay of our senior employees with shareholder 
interests and the Group’s long-term performance.

Malus and clawback provisions apply to all awards granted under 
discretionary share incentive plans.

In setting remuneration for Executive Directors, the Committee  
considers the overall approach to rewarding employees across  
the Group taking into account performance, the complexity, scale,  
scope or responsibility of the role, development within a role and/or 
significant market movement.

Consideration of shareholders’ views
The Committee is mindful of shareholder views when setting  
and evaluating ongoing remuneration principles and commits to 
consulting with shareholders prior to any significant changes to the 
Remuneration Policy.

We have held briefings with People Leaders and Executive Committee 
members to explain changes to the Reward Framework and alignment 
with the Executive Director Remuneration Policy. While employees are 
not directly consulted on the development of the Remuneration Policy 
for Executive Directors, employee forums held in key regional locations 
give employees the opportunity to provide feedback and express their 
views on any topic including executive remuneration.

The Committee receives ongoing regulatory updates and information  
on external market practices from its independent external advisers who 
provide additional context for decisions.

In formulating the revised 2024 Policy, we consulted extensively with 
nearly 100 shareholders, representing approximately 80% of LSEG’s 
voting rights, and proxy agencies. We are grateful for the valuable input 
provided by everyone we engaged with during this process, which 
informed the detail of our revised Policy. Overall, the majority of 
shareholders were supportive of our proposals and recognised  
the rationale of our thinking in light of the transformation and high 
performance of the business, both in absolute and relative terms,  
under our CEO’s leadership, and the need for LSEG to compete  
in a global talent market. 

Policy for Non-Executive Directors

Approach to setting fees

Basis of fees

Other items

The fees for Non-Executive Directors are set at a level which is considered 
appropriate to attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability 
to make an important contribution to the Group’s affairs.

The Chair’s fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee, and the 
Board is responsible for determining all other Non-Executive Director fees.

Fees are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain appropriate in the 
context of: the role scope; company size, complexity and global breadth; 
and wider market conditions. The Committee retains the flexibility to 
increase, adjust and make one-off payments to Non-Executive Directors 
based on their remit.

Fees are set taking into account the level of responsibility of each 
Non-Executive Director and fees at other companies of a similar size  
and complexity.

The aggregate basic fees payable to all Non-Executives combined 
(excluding fees as Chair and excluding fees paid for any appointments  
on subsidiary boards) are capped as set out in the Group’s Articles of 
Association as they may be amended by a resolution of shareholders  
from time to time. The current limit on the aggregate basic fees that are 
payable is £1,500,000 per financial year.

Non-Executive Directors receive  
a basic annual fee with additional 
fees payable for services such as 
committee chairmanship.

Non-Executive Directors are also 
entitled to receive fees from 
subsidiary companies if appointed  
to such boards.

The Non-Executive Chair of the 
Group receives an all-inclusive fee  
for the role.

Fees are neither performance-related 
nor pensionable.

Non-Executive Directors are not 
eligible to participate in the annual 
bonus or long-term incentive plans 
and are not entitled to any payments 
on termination.

Non-Executive Directors receive an 
allowance for any Board meeting 
involving intercontinental travel.

Travel and other appropriate 
expenses with associated taxes 
(including fees incurred in obtaining 
professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties) incurred 
in the course of performing  
their duties are reimbursed to 
Non-Executive Directors.

Non-Executive Directors are 
covered by the Directors’  
and Officers’ insurance and 
indemnification.

Non-Executive Directors are 
required to build up share 
ownership of at least 1x basic 
annual fees within three years  
of appointment.

Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with no notice 
period except for the Group Chair who has a notice period of six  
months unless he is not re-elected by shareholders in which case his 
appointment will terminate immediately. The Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointments are for an initial period of three years from the date of 
appointment and are also subject to re-election by shareholders.

Amendments to the Remuneration Policy Report
The Committee remains mindful that regulation of companies in the 
financial services sector continues to evolve. The Committee recognises 
that remuneration arrangements may need to be amended in order  
to comply with any new regulations which become applicable to the 
Group. The Committee reserves the right to make changes to the  
Policy described above in order to comply with any such regulatory 
requirements which apply to the Group including any changes required 
under the UK Corporate Governance Code or for regulatory, exchange

Remuneration Policy Report continued

Illustration of the application of the Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Directors
The chart on the right illustrates how much the current Executive 
Directors could receive under four different hypothetical performance 
scenarios for the first year of this policy taking effect i.e. 2024: minimum, 
mid-range, maximum and maximum assuming a 50% increase in share 
price for long-term incentive awards during the vesting period. It is 
important to highlight that the full impacts of the policy proposals will  
not be realised until 2029 when the 2024 long-term incentive award is 
released from the holding period, should stretching performance  
targets be met.

Notes to the table:
1  The value delivered through performance is calculated as the number of shares forecast to vest in 2024 multiplied by the share price on the date of grant. The value delivered through share 

price growth is calculated as the same number of shares multiplied by the difference between the average share price in the last three months of the financial year, being £86.34, and the share 
price on the date of grant, being £70.62. The Committee does not intend to amend the outcome or make any adjustments in regard to share price growth over the period, on the basis that this 
reflects our view of the Group’s underlying performance and returns for shareholders over the performance period.

2  Performance shares vested at 82% on 22 April 2023 at £80.84 per share.

David Schwimmer
3  Benefits include the cash value of private medical, income protection and life assurance plus expatriate allowances (including flight allowance which ceased on 31 December 2023) and 

commuting expenses (including car transportation where appropriate) with associated taxes. David Schwimmer contributed £500 per month to the 2020 SAYE plan until it matured on 1 June 2023 
and contributes £500 per month into the 2023 SAYE scheme which will mature in November 2026 with a six-month exercise window; these benefits have been valued based on the  
20% discount to market value on the SAYE option exercise price.

Anna Manz
4  Benefits include the cash value of private medical, income protection and life assurance plus commuting expenses (including car transportation where appropriate) with associated taxes. 

Further notes
There were no money or assets reported in any previous financial year that were subject to a recovery of sums paid or withholding during the year.

Payments for loss of office
No payments were made for loss of office during the year. 

Payments to past Directors
No payments were made to past Directors during the year.

Retirement benefits
In the UK, pension provision for our Executive Directors takes the form 
of a non-consolidated cash allowance; only base salary is used to 
calculate pension entitlement and no other pension supplements apply. 

David Schwimmer and Anna Manz each received an allowance 
equivalent to 10% of base salary as a taxable cash supplement, which is 
in line with the wider workforce, ensuring we are compliant with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 

Bonus awarded for FY2023
Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual bonus based on 
meeting or exceeding bonus targets that are set at the beginning of  
the year, looking at the Group’s financial performance and strategic 
objectives as well as personal performance.

The Remuneration Committee also receives input from the Risk 
Committee with regard to performance related to risk culture 
(awareness, transparency and accountability) when assessing 
remuneration decisions.

The operation of the FY2023 annual bonus is as per last year. The 
Group bonus pool was assessed 60% against financial performance and 
40% against strategic objectives. The Committee considers AOP to be 
of particular significance for the Group and believes it should continue 
to be the main financial measure for annual bonus plan purposes. The 
maximum bonus opportunity for FY23 was 225% of salary for the CEO 
and 200% of salary for the CFO. 

The Executive Directors’ awards are funded from the Group bonus  
pool. For FY2023 bonus awards for the Executive Directors and  
Group Executive team continue to be determined in accordance with 
performance assessed: 60% against Group AOP; 20% against Group 
strategic objectives; and 20% against personal objectives (including 
divisional objectives where applicable).

Personal performance is assessed against contribution to the strategic 
objectives, including cultural objectives, and against role-related goals 
and expected behaviours, taking into account both what has been 
achieved and how the individuals achieved their targets.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued

Additional notes to the Single total figure of remuneration

Fixed pay
Base salary
When reviewing Executive Director salaries, and in line with our Policy, 
the Committee considers multiple reference points including our sector 
peers and companies in the FTSE 30.

Benefits 
A flexible benefits plan is offered, in which individuals have certain core 
benefits (such as private medical, life assurance and income protection) 
together with (in the UK) a taxable cash allowance which can be spent 
on elective benefits (such as additional medical, life or dental cover). 
Where received as a cash supplement, this allowance is not used to 
calculate bonus payments or pension contributions. 

Benefits are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain affordable and 
competitive. Executives are eligible to participate in the Group’s HMRC 
tax-favoured SAYE Scheme (or international equivalent). There has been 
no change to the provision of benefits and all arrangements below have 
previously been disclosed.

David Schwimmer and Anna Manz receive a flexible benefits allowance 
of £15,000 per annum, which is unchanged from last year. In addition, 
the Executive Directors receive benefits in kind which include private 
health care, permanent health insurance and life assurance 
arrangements. Car transportation is also provided where appropriate.

As an expatriate from the US to UK, David Schwimmer received/receives 
the following:
Expired:
 — For the first five years of employment, an annual allowance of  
up to £50,000 to cover flights between London and the US  
for Mr Schwimmer and his family; this allowance ceased on  
31 December 2023.

Current:
 — Tax preparation and filing assistance in the US and the UK. 
 — The Group will meet the costs of repatriating Mr Schwimmer’s  
effects back to the US if the Group terminates his employment  
other than in circumstances such as serious misconduct which  
would justify termination.

Save As You Earn (SAYE)
David Schwimmer contributed £500 per month into the 2020 SAYE 
scheme which matured in June 2023, and he exercised on 1 June 2023. 
David contributes £500 per month into the 2023 SAYE scheme which 
will mature in November 2026 with a six-month exercise window.

Anna Manz contributed £500 per month into the 2021 SAYE scheme. 
Anna’s 2021 SAYE scheme lapsed upon her leaving date as per the  
plan rules.

Insurance and indemnification 
Executive Directors are covered by the Directors’ and Officers’ 
insurance and indemnification.

Malus and clawback
There are no contractual malus or clawback provisions in place in 
relation to benefits.

Summary assessment of strategic objectives
In determining the overall outcome of the strategic objectives for the FY2023 Group bonus pool, the Committee took into account certain factors 
relating to risk, including compliance risk and resilience, which meant that despite the otherwise strong strategic performance achieved against  
the objectives, the Committee determined that, on balance, the overall outcome of this component should be 28%. This outturn is lower than the 
previous year’s outturn of 31%. Further details of performance against strategic objectives is set out below.

David Schwimmer, 
Chief Executive Officer

 — David Schwimmer has led the Group’s strong performance in an uncertain macroeconomic environment and continues to 

transform our business and deliver on our strategy. He continues to grow the business at a faster rate than it had been, with 
growth for the full year towards the upper end of the +6-8% guidance range. We have established a consistent track-record of 
growth in our Data & Analytics business, with the ongoing improvements to our offering and strengthened customer relationships 
increasingly reflected in financial performance.

 — Under David’s leadership, the company is in a strong position financially; adjusted operating profit was £2.9 billion, up 7.9%  

on a constant currency basis; LSEG remains highly cash-generative and we continue to actively manage our capital allocation. 
The overhang on LSEG shares which was a significant drag at the beginning of the year has been seamlessly reduced with the 
Blackstone Consortium placements during 2023 oversubscribed due to strong demand from investors. The Blackstone holding 
has reduced from over 34% to around 11% over the year. LSEG’s share price closed 2023 at £92.74, +30% on the year, making it 
one of the best performing shares in its global sector peer group.

 — David continues to foster an inclusive culture, setting the tone from the top and introducing a new set of global values across the 
Group. The results of the employee engagement survey were strong at 75% (flat on 2022 and against a global benchmark of 
decline externally) and the participation rate of 88% was the highest it has ever been.

 — David has acted boldly to bring in high-calibre senior talent, making four new ExCo appointments (CIO, CPO, Group Head of D&A 
and Group Head of SAM), with three of these being external recruits. He has also secured a top calibre CFO and hired an Indices 
expert to run B&I.

 — David continues to drive the business forward. The reaction to LSEG’s Capital Markets Day has been positive with clear 

communication of the company’s medium and long-term strategy, including raising of growth-targets, acceleration of delivery  
of Microsoft products and announcement of further returns to shareholders.

 — David has demonstrated a strong track record with LSEG achieving EPS and TSR performance around the upper quartile  

relative to the company’s global sector peer group under his tenure. The feedback received during the Remuneration Policy 
review from LSEG’s top 40 shareholders consistently recognised the importance of his role and transformational leadership  
as a strength for LSEG.

Anna Manz’s personal performance was not subject to assessment for the purposes of the 2023 bonus given her resignation and forfeiture of the award.

Compulsory deferral under existing Remuneration Policy 
Executive Directors must compulsorily defer 50% of their bonus into 
shares for a period of three years under the existing Policy. Dividend 
equivalents will be paid in respect of deferred shares on vesting.

LTIP Awards granted in April 2020 (vesting in 2023)
The awards granted in 2020 were based on relative TSR performance 
versus the FTSE 100 Index peer group and adjusted EPS performance in 
the 36-month performance period to December 2022. The relative TSR 
element vested at 56% and the AEPS element vested at 100%. These 
vesting outcomes reflect the delivery of significant value and reflects 
AEPS growth of 11% year-on-year and 19% CAGR over the three-year 
performance period; and 13.4% TSR performance over the three-year 
period (4.3% annualised) representing 6th decile performance relative  
to the FTSE 100 peer group. The vesting price at 22 April 2023 was 
£80.84. These values are shown in the single figure table for the 
financial year ending December 2022.

LTIP Awards granted in March 2021 (to vest in 2024)
The AEPS element of the LTIP awards made in 2021 will vest at 100% 
and the Relative TSR element will vest at 0%. These vesting outcomes 
reflect the delivery of AEPS growth of 18.3% CAGR over the three-year 
performance period; and 8.1% TSR performance over the three-year 
performance period (2.6%% annualised), representing 43rd percentile 
performance relative to the FTSE 100 peer group. The TSR position 
partly reflects the significant growth in the share price in the years 
leading up to the start of the 2021 LTIP performance period during  
which LSEG was consistently upper quartile.

The value shown in the single figure table on page 137 for the financial 
year ending December 2023 represents the estimated value of the 
2021 awards which will vest in March 2024. The estimated value 
(including the estimated value of the award that reflects share price 
growth) is based on the average share price in the final three months  
of the financial year (£86.34). The Committee does not intend to amend 
the outcome or make any adjustments in regard to share price growth 
over the period, on the basis that this vesting reflects our view of the 
Group’s underlying performance and returns for shareholders over the 
performance period. The awards are subject to a two-year post-vesting 
holding period.

1  No FY2023 bonus will be awarded to Anna Manz, who resigned as CFO on 25 May 2023 

and left the Group on 29 February 2024.

Other share plans (SAYE, SharePurchase)
All permanent UK employees, including Executive Directors, are eligible 
to participate in the HM Revenue & Customs tax-favoured Save As You 
Earn Scheme (SAYE). Under the rules of the SAYE, participants can save 
up to £500 each month, for a period of three years. At the end of the 
saving period, savings may be used to acquire ordinary shares by 
exercising the related option. The options may be granted at an exercise 
price which represents a discount of up to 20% to market value at the 
date of invitation. No performance conditions are attached to SAYE 
options. Employees in Sri Lanka, including Executive Directors, are 
eligible to participate in an equivalent international SAYE plan.

There is also a SharePurchase Plan, which is designed to provide share 
incentives to all people in our Group, including Executive Directors,  
who are not based in the UK or Sri Lanka. SharePurchase allows eligible 
employees in 29 countries to purchase up to an equivalent of £500  
of LSEG ordinary shares per month, who are then awarded additional 
shares which vest after the completion of a three-year plan cycle.  
No performance conditions are attached to the award. During 2023 we 
launched SharePurchase into nine new countries, meaning that this year 
more than 91% of our employees globally were offered the opportunity 
to benefit from our success and share in LSEG’s future by participating 
in one of our employee share ownership plans.

In 2023, David Schwimmer commenced saving at the maximum of  
£500 per month under the SAYE, and was granted an option on exactly 
the same terms as all other eligible employees. David had previously 
saved into the 2020 SAYE plan at the maximum £500 per month  
and exercised his 2020 SAYE option when it matured in June 2023. 
Anna Manz’s 2021 SAYE option lapsed on her leaving date as per  
the plan rules.

These all-employee share plans are a core component of our people 
proposition and benefits offering, acting as a modest retention tool  
with over 33% of eligible employees globally being enrolled in plans 
during 2023. 

Implementation of the Remuneration Policy during 2024 (1 January 
2024 to 31 December 2024) (subject to shareholder approval)
Base salary operation:
As part of the Policy review, the Committee also considered base  
salary levels for our Executive Directors, in the context of the overall 
Policy changes.

As discussed in the Statement by the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee (set out on pages 118 to 123), we are proposing a total 
remuneration package which appropriately reflects the CEO’s proven 
ability, exceptional performance and the true market for his role and 
talent, whilst remaining respectful of UK norms (both in terms of the 
balance of different elements of pay and the link to short and longer-
term performance). The CEO’s salary will be £1,375,000 in FY24, at the 
level required to achieve a competitive overall market positioning 
broadly in line with the median of sector peers, without the need to 
increase the other elements of pay to levels that would be inconsistent 
with UK practice.

No changes are proposed to the salary of the exiting CFO.  
A salary of £850,000 was agreed for the new CFO with a start  
date of 26 February 2024.

Pension operation:
The CEO and the CFO receive a pension contribution of 10% of salary 
which is in line with the wider workforce, ensuring compliance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code. 

Annual bonus operation:
 — For FY2024 the weighting of financial measures within the bonus 

pool will be increased from 60% to 75%, incorporating both AOP and 
Future Growth measures. The Group bonus pool will be determined 
based on performance measures weighted 60% Group AOP, 15% 
Future Growth and 25% Group Strategic Objectives to be assessed 
over a 12-month performance period.

 — For FY2024, we are maintaining our high level of focus on 

sustainability within the assessment of the strategic objectives 
element, reflecting our commitment to drive financial stability, 
empower economies and enable customers to create  
sustainable growth.

 — The Executive Directors’ awards are funded from the Group bonus 

pool. Bonus awards for the Executive Directors will be determined in 
accordance with performance assessed: 60% against Group AOP; 
15% Future Growth, 15% against Group Strategic Objectives;  
and 10% against personal objectives (including divisional objectives 
where applicable).

 — Personal performance is assessed against contribution to the 
strategic objectives, including cultural objectives, and against 
role-related goals and expected behaviours, taking into account  
both what has been achieved and how the individuals achieved  
their targets.

 — The Remuneration Committee receives input from the Risk  

Committee with regard to performance related to risk culture 
(awareness, transparency and accountability) when assessing 
remuneration decisions.

 — 60% of any bonus payment for Executive Directors will be paid  
in March 2025. Under our new Policy, the remaining 40% will be 
deferred into shares for a period of three years. 

 — Deferred awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions  

(e.g. in cases of material misstatement, gross misconduct, 
misbehaviour or material failure of risk management) with  
judgement applied by the Committee. 

 — For good leavers, deferred awards will usually vest at the normal 

vesting date and in full, unless the Committee determines to scale 
back the award based on any factors deemed relevant. Where an 
individual is not considered to be a good leaver, unvested awards  
will lapse. 

Long-term incentives (granted under the Equity Incentive Plan):
Long-term incentive awards are intended to be granted under the new 
EIP in 2024 in line with our revised Policy and subject to shareholder 
approval. The 2024 long-term incentive awards will be subject to  
a two-year holding period in addition to the three-year vesting period, 
resulting in a total five-year period from the date of grant.

The Committee has given careful consideration to the target ranges 
applicable to the 2024 grant, in particular to ensure that AEPS growth 
targets are appropriately stretching taking into account both internal  
and external forecasts. For the AEPS element (60% weighting), the 
performance targets will range from 7% to 12.5% growth per annum.  
This means that both the threshold and maximum end of the ranges  
are higher than the targets set for the 2023 LTIP grant. To achieve 
maximum vesting, an incremental £1.1bn AOP would be required in 2026, 
equivalent to incremental income in the region of £2.05bn, relative  
to 2023. We expect that this AEPS range will be one of the highest, if 
not the highest, in the FTSE 30 and continues to demonstrate LSEG’s 
commitment to setting class-leading, stretching targets. Furthermore,  
the higher AEPS baseline makes AEPS CAGR growth increasingly 
challenging to achieve for LSEG.

Annual Report on Remuneration continued

For the TSR element (40% weighting), the relative performance targets 
will be assessed against our global sector peer group and the FTSE 100, 
each weighted 50:50. Performance targets will range from median to 
upper quartile for both peer groups. 

Malus and clawback provisions will apply to these awards, allowing  
the Committee to reduce subsisting awards or request the re-transfer  
of value in respect of already paid or vested awards in certain 
circumstances (see page 132 above). The 2024 awards will vest three 
years after the grant date subject to relative TSR and adjusted EPS 
performance measures as follows:

Shareholding requirements
The minimum shareholding requirement is 600 per cent of base salary 
for the CEO, 400 per cent of base salary for the CFO and 200-300 per 
cent of base salary for the Group Executive team. Executive Directors 
will also be required to hold the lower of their actual shareholding and 
100% of their MSR for two years post-departure.

Non-Executive Directors’ fees for 2024
There are no changes to Non-Executive Directors’ fees and therefore 
the fee schedule for 2024 is as follows: 

Fees

Group Chair

Senior Independent Director

Non-Executive Director base fee  
(inclusive of Committee memberships)

With effect

£95,000

Audit/Remuneration/Risk Committee Chair 

£40,000 

£40,000

Non-Executive Directors are also required to build up a shareholding 
requirement of 1x basic annual fees, to be built up within three years  
of appointment.

Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration 
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is determined by the Board  
and is neither performance-related nor pensionable. The Chair’s  
fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee. The fees for 
Non-Executive Directors are set at a level which is intended to 
recognise the significant responsibilities of Directors and to attract 
individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make an 
important contribution to the Company’s affairs. Comparisons are  
made with fees paid at FTSE 30 companies.

A travel allowance of £4,000 per intercontinental trip for Non-Executive 
Directors reflects the global nature of the Group’s business and the 
additional time commitment required for travel. The Group Chair is not 
eligible for this allowance as he receives an all-inclusive fee for his role.

Travel and other appropriate expenses with associated taxes  
(including fees incurred in obtaining professional advice) incurred  
in the course of performing their duties are reimbursed to the Chair  
and to the Non-Executive Directors. 

The Chair and the Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of 
the Company’s annual bonus or long-term incentive plans and are not 
entitled to any payments on termination.
