We are exposed to structurally  
high growth markets 

We have built a global footprint that enables us to serve a broad range 
of customers around the world. 

Growing markets
We serve multiple asset classes and growing liquidity pools, including 
equities, FX and fixed income markets. Through our Data & Analytics 
business we are also able to capitalise on the growing demand for  
data, insight and automation. We expect this demand to accelerate 
further as the adoption of cloud, AI and automation continues to 
increase in the coming years. 

For more information on relevant 
market trends and our responses  
– refer to pages 08 and 09.

Diverse geographies
We have a balanced global exposure, generating 43% of income in 
EMEA, 42% in the Americas and 15% in APAC. This is supported by the 
distribution and diversity of our people – with 56% of our headcount 
based in APAC, including our leading operations and customer  
support hubs in Bengaluru, Manila and Colombo.

We generate more than 70% of our income through recurring revenue 
associated with data subscriptions and licences. This business model 
benefits from a consistently high level of retention, contracts that are 
typically 12-24 months in duration and improving performance in our 
Annual Subscription Value (ASV). 

We are well positioned to capitalise on growing pools of transactional 
income through our venues. This includes Tradeweb, which continues  
to benefit from the electronification of rates and credit markets, and 
other businesses positioned to attract liquidity flow such as FXall  
(FX dealer-to-client), Matching (FX dealer-to-dealer) and LCH which 
benefits from volume growth in swaps and other OTC derivative markets.

We are highly cash generative, allowing us to invest organically in new 
products and services, continually modernise our infrastructure and 
acquire businesses that are complementary to our business model and 
distribution footprint. In 2023 we continued to invest in our business, 
through a combination of building new products to drive organic growth, 
transforming our technology and continuing to ensure our systems  
are resilient and secure. We also completed the acquisition of Acadia, 
supporting our development of innovative post trade solutions and 
unlocking the growth potential of the business within the Group.  
For more information on this acquisition, see our Post Trade 2023 
highlights on page 41 and a case study on our Post Trade Solutions 
offering on page 43.

Our 10-year strategic partnership with Microsoft will also help build 
next-generation services that empower customers to generate business 
insights, automate complex and time-consuming processes and 
ultimately, do more with less. For more information on our partnership 
and how we are investing in joint product development alongside 
Microsoft, see page 19.

More detail on capital allocation can  
be found in our Chief Financial Officer’s 
review on page 46 and on our website: 
www.lseg.com/investor-relations/.

Market trends  
and our response

Demand for data and its integration  
into workflows

Rise of new technologies  
including AI 

Growth in global demand for high-quality, precision time stamped and 
differentiated datasets from flexible, reliable and traceable data, which  
offer choice of on-premise and cloud service delivery.

What is LSEG’s response?
We continue to invest in our real-time and pricing offerings to add more 
latency options and we are embracing automation to improve the quality  
and breadth of our data across asset classes. We are focused on maintaining 
our position as the #1 real-time data provider by offering more choice in 
public and private cloud, and managed on-premise solutions. 

Example of this in action
Our Real-Time Optimised service, hosted on the public cloud, provides fast 
and simple access to our unparalleled content from hundreds of exchanges 
and OTC markets around the world allowing our customers depth of content, 
choice of service and delivering speed to market. 

Cloud-enabled business models such as Data-as-a-Service (DaaS), 
Data-Management-as-a-Service (DMaaS) and Analytics-as-a-Service  
(AaaS) are emerging as firms look to build new solutions and do more  
with data and analytics. 

What is LSEG’s response?
We are developing new and innovative data and analytics solutions  
for our clients in the cloud, enabled by our multi-cloud approach. 

Example of this in action
Our next-gen content offering is reinventing the data experience for our 
customers and addressing the growing number of challenges they face 
around handling data. This is being done in partnership with Microsoft –  
for more information on this partnership, see page 19.

With increasing automation and liquidity fragmentation and evolving 
regulation, there is a growing need for smarter, faster, safer trading platforms, 
enabling end-to-end trading workflows, with access to liquidity, data and 
execution. We can also be affected by evolving regulation ourselves. 

Process automation, machine learning and AI continue to create 
opportunities for operational efficiencies, alongside the development  
of new innovative products.

What is LSEG’s response?
We are joining up all our workflows across multiple areas of our businesses 
to create seamless and interoperable offerings for our customers. We also 
continue to work closely with regulators on an ongoing basis. For example, 
we have been in ongoing dialogue with the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) as they conduct their study into the wholesale data market. We await 
their findings as they look to assess the competitive landscape of this space. 

Example of this in action
We are integrating our recently acquired Order and Execution Management 
System (OEMS) platform, TORA, into Workspace. This will create an 
end-to-end buy-side workflow solution for traders and fund managers, with 
seamless access to, and interoperability with, our datasets and analytics.

The continued global focus on growth that is sustainable in all senses  
is driving increasing demand for sustainably-linked investments and products. 
Investors are increasingly allocating capital to sustainable portfolios and 
strategies, while market participants are integrating sustainability into 
workflows and business models, in many cases driven by emerging 
regulatory requirements that differ by market. 

What is LSEG’s response?
We are developing new products to deliver on our commitment to  
enable sustainable growth for our customers and their communities.

Example of this in action
Our new climate data package includes an expanded set of reported  
data measures, sophisticated analytics, new climate emission estimate 
models and third-party data from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).  
This solution consolidates our capabilities on climate to help our clients 
manage climate risk, build investment strategies and products, and report  
on climate transition.

What is LSEG’s response?
We have been using AI and machine learning across our business for  
many years and we continue to build AI functionality into our platforms  
and workflows. Our peers are also investing and innovating in this evolving 
space, leading to increased competition and quality of AI-powered products 
and services.

Example of this in action
Two examples of AI in our offering include: 1) Content ingestion in our  
Data & Analytics business, which uses natural language processing (NLP)  
to automate transcripts of company webcasts, reducing average processing 
time of transcript summaries into Workspace; and 2) Advanced Dealing,  
our fully integrated, cloud-based FX trading environment with AI-powered, 
chat-driven trading functionality.

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI drives both  
a need for ever more expansive data sets and the opportunity for businesses 
to access more data, in faster, more efficient and trusted ways. 

What is LSEG’s response?
We are using generative AI to further modernise our business, enhance 
customer productivity and unlock operational efficiencies. We aim to be the 
trusted provider of financial services data for usage by AI models across 
financial services, leveraging our data breadth, quality and auditability.

Example of this in action
We have a bespoke AI framework, tailored using our data and IP, to generate 
insights and create intelligent workflows. Furthermore, in partnership with 
Microsoft we are developing AI-powered copilots and solutions to be 
delivered through Microsoft platforms, which will ease discoverability  
and usage of our data.

Electronification and digitisation  
of trading 

Regulation, risk management and  
the need for capital optimisation

Electronification of financial markets continues to drive trading volume 
growth, improve efficiency and enable access to liquidity. This trend is 
expected to continue as many asset classes are far from reaching maturity  
in adoption of electronic and automated trading.

Market volatility highlights the importance of trusted venues and secure 
clearing houses that are capable of meeting demand spikes. Cases of 
extreme volatility can ultimately lead to the consolidation of some of  
our customers, as we saw in 2023 with Credit Suisse.

What is LSEG’s response?
Tradeweb is continuously innovating to remain the platform of choice as  
fixed income trading becomes increasingly electronic. 

Example of this in action
Tradeweb launched improvements to its Automated Intelligent Execution 
(AiEX) tool, where clients can link their order management systems directly  
to the Tradeweb platform, fully automating the execution of the trade. 
Tradeweb has continued to evolve the technology, adding asset classes  
and new trading protocols, such as click-to-trade, Request-for-Market (RFM) 
and portfolio trading.

The rise in the use of – and demand for – digital assets across both  
retail and institutional investors as well as with central authorities and  
asset managers and custodians is driving increased customer demand  
for associated financial markets infrastructure, data and analytics.

What is LSEG’s response?
Expanding the coverage of our asset classes whilst adhering to our high  
risk standards is key to ensuring we fully support customers navigating 
emerging drivers of market volatility, such as the failure of FTX Trading.

Example of this in action
We announced our intention to partner with GFO-X to provide a regulated 
crypto future trading and clearing infrastructure.

Digital platforms are unlocking growth across multiple segments  
including digital exchanges, digital payments, online banking and retail 
wealth, driving greater demand for efficiency across the trade lifecycle.

What is LSEG’s response?
Our vision is to create the first global digital market infrastructure that 
provides an open access, all-to-all solution for transferring securities:  
any asset class, anywhere in the world, at any time and end-to-end,  
from issuance to post trade processing.

Example of this in action
We announced plans for a new digital market infrastructure, which will 
facilitate capital market transactions using distributed ledger technology. 

What is LSEG’s response?
Our market infrastructure businesses play a key role in helping participants  
to navigate major events, such as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 
2023. Heightened market volatility is a positive driver of revenue for parts  
of our business, e.g. our OTC Derivatives clearing business in 2023.

Example of this in action
LCH is a global business; our FX, IRS, CDS, equities and repo markets are all 
cross-border markets, enabling us to provide clearing services to customers 
in over 60 countries.

A combination of regulatory and capital requirements and pressure  
to improve operational efficiency is driving heightened need for our 
customers to manage capital and cost. Many are seeking ways to automate 
and streamline post trade workflows for cleared and uncleared OTC 
derivatives and optimise how their balance sheets are utilised.

What is LSEG’s response?
We are bringing the benefits of our clearing house and OTC derivatives 
know-how to the uncleared space, working alongside our partners to  
support their regulatory compliance and capital optimisation needs.

Example of this in action
We are consolidating three assets to create Post Trade Solutions:  
1) SwapAgent, our clearing house for bilateral derivatives; 2) Quantile,  
which provides financial resource optimisation solutions; and 3) Acadia, 
providing standardised collateral and multi-asset class workflow capabilities 
for uncleared OTC derivatives. For more information on Post Trade Solutions, 
refer to page 43.

The impacts of accelerated digitisation, including open banking, emerging 
regulations, the growth in digital payments and increased cross-border 
business operations, have created new risks for our clients and their 
customers. Firms are seeking ways to manage these risks by better 
understanding their customer base/supply network (Know Your Customer 
– KYC and Know Your Third Party – KY3P) and minimising incidences of  
fraud and illicit activity through anti-money laundering solutions and digital 
customer identification.

What is LSEG’s response?
We help our clients comply with mandatory KYC, anti-bribery and corruption, 
and associated legislation, and support them in detecting money laundering, 
and account and payment fraud. We also help them counter the financing  
of terrorism, human trafficking, modern day slavery and green crime.

Example of this in action
Our globally recognised World Check database helps clients to meet their 
due diligence obligations and identify potential financial criminal activity.  
The importance of this service has been heightened in a year of significant 
geopolitical tension.

Overview
In 2023, LSEG delivered a strong performance as we continue to 
transform our business and deliver on our strategy to be the leading 
global financial markets infrastructure and data provider. Total income 
excluding recoveries was £8.0 billion, up 8.3% on a constant currency 
basis, while adjusted operating profit was £2.9 billion, up 7.9% on  
a constant currency basis and adjusted EPS grew 1.9%.

two of the Board’s Directors are from a minority ethnic background.  
At the end of 2023, the Board was over 40% female, however, following 
Anna’s departure and Michel-Alain’s arrival, this will drop to below 40%. 

As part of our commitment to visit one international office per year to 
engage with colleagues, the Board visited the Paris office to hear more 
from them and learn about our customers in the region.

With over 70% of revenues recurring, we remain highly cash generative 
and continue to carefully manage our capital allocation. We completed  
a £750 million directed share buyback in Q3 and have now returned  
a total of £1.5 billion to shareholders via buybacks since August 2022. 
We have also announced plans to return £1 billion to shareholders  
via further share buybacks during 2024. 

We have seen significant evolution in our shareholder base, with the 
Blackstone-led consortium making excellent progress in selling their 
shares to existing and new institutional investors. The Blackstone 
holding has reduced from over 34% to around 11% over the year.

At our Capital Markets event in November 2023, we outlined our  
new medium-term guidance. We expect mid to high single-digit organic 
revenue growth, accelerating after 2024, as customers begin to benefit 
from investment in our platforms and our partnership with Microsoft.  
We also expect our EBITDA margin to increase over time, while capital 
expenditure will decline to a high single-digit percentage of income. We 
also expect cumulative free cash flow to exceed adjusted profit after tax.

The Board is proposing a final dividend of 79.3 pence per share, 
representing a total dividend of 115.0 pence per share, a 7.5% increase.

Governance
The Board seeks to operate to and maintain the highest governance 
and ethical standards. Further detail is available in the Board’s 
governance report from page 92.

In February 2023, Scott Guthrie joined the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director in connection with LSEG’s strategic partnership with Microsoft. 
Scott’s long-standing career at Microsoft, including running the Microsoft 
Cloud and AI Group business, and deep technology expertise provides 
a unique and valuable perspective to the Group as we continue to 
deliver on our ambition.

Erin Brown and Doug Steenland stepped down as Non-Executive 
Directors of the Board, following the sales of shares by the Blackstone-
led consortium. I’d like to thank them both for their contributions to the 
Group since the acquisition of Refinitiv in 2021 and wish them all the 
best in their future endeavours. 

In November 2023, we announced that Michel-Alain Proch had  
been appointed Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Board of  
LSEG plc. This followed Anna Manz’s decision to step down in order  
to assume another CFO role. Anna has been a valued member of the 
LSEG Board and I would like to thank her for the key role she has played 
in the successful delivery of the Group’s strategy over the last three 
years. I would also like to welcome Michel-Alain to the Board and look 
forward to working with him. 

I am pleased to confirm that we meet the Parker Review 
recommendations, and that we meet all recommendations set out by  
the FTSE Women Leaders Review. Two of the four senior positions in the 
Company outlined in the Listing Rules are currently held by women and 

1  We aim to reduce operational emissions (Scope 1, Scope 2 (market based) and selected 

Scope 3 for FERA, business travel, home working, commuting) by 50% vs a 2019 baseline. 
For more information on our Climate Transition Plan and all of our climate-based targets,  
refer to page 63 of this report and to our 2023 Sustainability Report.

Sustainability
As described in the Sustainability section of the Strategic Report  
(pages 58 to 68), LSEG has many initiatives in place to deliver our 
commitment to be a strategic enabler of sustainable economic growth. 
Given our central role in capital markets, our global footprint and 
presence throughout the trade lifecycle, LSEG is uniquely positioned  
to play a leading role in this respect. 

LSEG’s role in sustainability, and tackling climate change in particular,  
is very important to the Board, as well as the Group’s shareholders, 
employees, customers and regulators. The Board is committed to 
meeting the expectations of our shareholders and other stakeholders  
in this regard. 

We remain committed to our ambition to reach net zero by 2040 and  
to our Climate Transition Plan which we published in 2022, the first 
global exchange group to do so. Our primary near-term target is to 
reduce all of our operational emissions1 by 50% by 2030, from a 2019 
baseline. By the end of 2023, we had achieved a 29% reduction in 
these emissions (2022: 57%). Like many companies, we saw a steep 
reduction in our carbon emissions during the Covid-19 pandemic and 
emissions have naturally increased over the past two years as physical 
activity levels normalise. We remain well on track to achieve all of our  
Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi)-approved targets.

Remuneration policy
The Board and Committee believe it is essential to reset our Executive 
Director pay, adjusting the three core elements — salary, annual bonus, 
and long-term incentive provisions — to closely align the overall pay 
quantum with the median of our global sector peer pay. The proposed 
revisions to the Policy address our desire to reinforce a pay-for 
performance philosophy as the majority of the quantum reset is 
performance-based. We will continue to set stretching targets to ensure 
bonus and LTIP vesting is warranted only when underlying performance 
and shareholder value creation is strong. We are considering CEO 
compensation in the very specific circumstances of David Schwimmer, 
taking into account his outstanding past performance and strategic 
direction. The revised remuneration policy, as outlined from page 118, 
will be subject to shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM.

Summary
It has been another year of strong progress in 2023. We will continue  
to invest in our global talent and growing our global businesses,  
in partnership with our customers, to drive revenue growth and 
increased profitability.

On behalf of the Board, I’d like to thank our colleagues across the world 
for their continued commitment throughout the year. I look forward to 
working with the Board and LSEG’s Executive Committee to achieve  
our strategic objectives as we transform the financial services industry.

What differentiates LSEG’s business?
LSEG is a truly global business with operations in over 60 countries and 
providing services into more than 170 countries. We span multiple asset 
classes and we provide services throughout the entire trade lifecycle. 
None of our competitors has the breadth of offering or the global reach 
of LSEG. This in turn, supports genuine long-term partnerships built  
on trust. From a financial perspective, the nature of our services, the 
markets we are aligned to and relationships we have, mean that the 
quality and visibility of our earnings are very high and not correlated  
to a single driver.

The breadth and depth of our offering is a true strategic differentiator. 
Customers recognise that because we serve them across so many 
different parts of their business, our relationship is not that of a typical 
supplier. We are a strategic partner. We are increasingly working in 
partnership with our customers’ leadership teams to solve problems  
and create opportunities. We help them simplify their business, reduce 
their reliance on multiple other vendors and drive growth, innovation 
and efficiency. We have competitors in each segment, but our 
customers really value our breadth and the benefits that it brings them.

What are the drivers for future growth?
LSEG is operating in growing markets and the range of our products  
and services brings diverse revenue streams. In addition, our 
partnership with Microsoft means we will be able to address new 
markets, which will offer us additional opportunities for growth.

Other opportunities for long-term growth include expansion into new 
industry verticals. As well as the investment we’re making with Microsoft, 
products in areas like Risk Intelligence have broad applications. Our 
expertise in data management is second to none and as companies 
across industries become increasingly data driven, they will look to 
experts to help them manage their data. We are well-positioned to play 
that role. In private markets, we are investing in developing a trading 
venue for private companies to create a funding continuum between 
private and public markets. We are also looking in more detail at digital 
markets infrastructure in partnership with Microsoft and others.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued

Introduction
In 2023, we continued to deliver for our customers and shareholders 
despite an uncertain macroeconomic environment, with ongoing interest 
rate rises and recession risks impacting markets around the world.  
The actions that LSEG has taken to transform and diversify our business 
over the past three years have positioned us well to capitalise on 
powerful industry trends and meet the evolving needs of our customers.

How did LSEG perform in 2023?
We delivered another year of strong revenue growth, with good 
contributions from all of our business divisions. In Data & Analytics,  
we’re innovating to improve our customer offering on many fronts  
and this helped to drive revenue growth of 7.3%1 in 2023. Revenue 
benefits from higher customer satisfaction were also reflected in Annual 
Subscription Value growth, which reached 6.7% by the end of the year. 
Businesses that historically had been underperforming and losing 
market share, such as Trading & Banking, are now achieving consistent 
healthy growth, building on our deep and broad customer relationships. 

Our Enterprise Data business is growing well. We are seeing strong 
demand for our data sets, including from investors deploying capital 
through AI- and quant-driven strategies. A great example of this is Tick 
History, our comprehensive database of historical pricing information 
and one of our many proprietary datasets. It gives customers access  
to over 87 trillion ticks of data, spanning 100 million instruments, across 
over 500 trading venues dating back more than 25 years of Tick History 
Data. By combining this with our PCAP – or Packet Capture data –  
we offer a very powerful subset of historical pricing information  
with precise, nanosecond timestamps.

We’re also accelerating innovation in our Investment Solutions business, 
where we’re going to market much faster with new index products 
thanks to our investment in the systems that drive the business. In Post 
Trade, volumes in interest rate swaps clearing and other products, as 
well as the expansion of our business into the uncleared space, drove 
total income up by 17.4%1. Capital Markets achieved revenue growth  
of 6.1%1, largely driven by Tradeweb as the team continues to innovate 
while benefiting from the ongoing electronification of fixed income 
markets. In equities, 2023 was a poor year globally for IPOs, but looking 
ahead, the pipeline in 2024 is encouraging.

Our adjusted EBITDA margin was slightly lower than in 2022,  
reflecting investment in the Microsoft partnership, the in-year impact  
of acquisitions and some FX-related items. We’re continuing to improve  
our underlying profitability and excluding these impacts, we delivered 
adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110bps in 2023.

The strong income growth we delivered, coupled with ongoing cost 
discipline and strong delivery of Refinitiv-related synergies, helped  
drive growth in our adjusted operating profit of 7.9%1.

We’re continuing to strengthen and unify the LSEG business. Our brand 
campaign clarifies how we show up to the market, bringing cohesion 
and simplicity to what was once a confusing image of over 20 branded 
products. At the same time, we’ve created a new culture focused on 
driving collaboration across our Group. 

In December 2022, we announced an exciting strategic partnership  
with Microsoft and we’ve made excellent progress over the past year. 
We are beginning the rollout of new products in the first half of 2024 
with a steady drumbeat of pilots, launches and ongoing enhancements 
developed in partnership with some of our biggest customers.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued

What are LSEG’s priorities for 2024 and beyond?
In less than three years we have transformed LSEG into a leading 
financial markets infrastructure and data business, trebling the growth 
rate of the Refinitiv Data & Analytics businesses we acquired and 
beating the growth targets we had set, line by line. However, the real 
opportunity still lies in front of us. As we enter the next phase of growth, 
we will develop our leading businesses across the financial markets 
lifecycle to create seamless workflows within and across asset classes. 
We will provide our customers with new AI-driven insights based on our 
trusted and validated data, combined with straight-through execution, 
risk management and capital efficiency across their businesses. 

Through investment, innovation and partnership we will shape the future 
of our industry. We expect growth to accelerate over the medium term. 
Margins will expand and our strong cash generation will further improve, 
creating opportunities for reinvestment in growth and continued 
shareholder returns. We will build on our differentiated customer 
proposition to affirm our position as the partner of choice across the 
financial markets value chain. 

Throughout this process, our people will be central to our success.  
Our corporate values of integrity, partnership, excellence and change 
form the basis for how we approach everything we do and encourage 
an inclusive culture that values a range of perspectives and embraces 
diversity of every kind. On behalf of the Executive Committee, I would 
like to thank all our people for their hard work and commitment in 
delivering another year of transformation for LSEG.

Partnering to transform the financial services industry
In December 2022, we launched a 10-year partnership with Microsoft  
to deliver next-generation data, analytics and cloud infrastructure 
solutions that will change the way financial markets participants interact, 
collaborate and derive insight. By integrating Workspace with Microsoft’s 
productivity suite, we will deliver an enhanced workflow experience  
that offers seamless Microsoft Teams communication and Microsoft 365 
interoperability with built-in compliance. Plus, with Microsoft’s cutting-
edge generative AI technology and by migrating our data platform  
and other key technology infrastructure to the Microsoft Azure 
environment, we will make it easier for our customers to discover, 
manage, share and analyse petabytes of unstructured data.

A meaningful growth opportunity
Today, we estimate that our Data & Analytics total addressable market 
(TAM) stands at around £35 billion. However, this only represents spend 
on third-party providers and is under half of the market’s total outlay  
on data and analytics. There is a further c.£50 billion of spend that is 
currently taken in-house to perform manual activities such as cleaning, 
validating and storing data, and we hear a clear message from our 
customers that they want to outsource these activities. By combining  
our data management expertise with Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure  
and suite of AI applications, we’re positioning ourselves to address this 
incremental TAM. Over time, we expect the partnership will meaningfully 
increase revenue growth for LSEG.

Delivering ahead of schedule
We have hundreds of people working across the partnership to build 
these products and through our Design Partner Programme, we are 
working alongside some of our largest customers to understand their 
desires and pain points, ensuring these are factored into key product 
development decisions. We are making excellent progress and we now 
expect that the first solutions will become available in the first half of 
2024 – ahead of our original expectations. Solutions will initially be 
made available through pilot programmes – starting with some 
productivity tools and O365 interoperability – before a steady

2023 Financial KPIs

Total income  
growth1

Annualised Subscription 
Value (ASV) growth

We are focused on delivering consistently 
strong financial performance and achieving  
the targets we have set.

Definition
Income growth, independent  
of FX movements. 

These core financial KPIs demonstrate  
the value we are delivering for both our 
customers and shareholders and they  
show that our strategy is working.

These KPIs align to our Group  
Strategic Objectives (GSOs) which  
help determine Executive Director 
remuneration and performance- 
related pay for all employees.
Further detail on the GSO performance 
assessment can be found in our 
Directors’ Remuneration Report  
on pages 139 to 141.

Why this is important for LSEG
Income growth is a key measure 
of our success since we operate 
in growing markets and aim to 
hold or grow market share. For 
2023, we guided to total income 
growth (excluding recoveries)  
of 6-8%, excluding new M&A. 

Going forward, we expect to 
deliver mid to high single-digit 
organic income growth, 
accelerating after 2024.

Analysis
We delivered total income growth1 
of 8.3% in 2023. Excluding the 
impact of the Acadia acquisition, 
we delivered growth of 7.7%, 
towards the upper end of our 
6-8% guidance range.

All divisions contributed to this 
growth. We continued improving 
product retention in Data & 
Analytics by investing in and 
expanding our content and 
capabilities, also realising a higher 
price review in 2023. In Post 
Trade, uncertainty around global 
interest rates drove robust client 
clearing activity at SwapClear  
and we translated this into  
strong growth. In Capital  
Markets, Tradeweb continued to 
innovate and drive expansion in 
international markets, as structural 
electronification tailwinds persist.

Definition
A point in time measure of  
our book of recurring contracts  
vs 12 months ago.

Why this is important for LSEG
>70% of our revenues are 
subscription-based with a high 
degree of visibility. ASV growth 
measures the year-on-year growth 
of that recurring book of business 
at a point in time. ASV growth 
should act as a leading indicator 
for subscription revenue growth 
and has three key drivers: 
retention, new sales and  
price increases.  

Analysis
Our year-end ASV growth of  
6.7% represents an acceleration  
of 370bps since the acquisition  
of Refinitiv. This reflects the 
significant progress we have 
made strengthening our offering 
through a combination of: better 
execution, a greater focus on  
our customers and targeted 
investment in our products  
and services.

In 2023, we delivered 
approximately 100bps of 
incremental ASV growth through 
higher price reviews. On the 
whole, we had positive price 
review conversations with our 
customers as the incremental 
value we have added to our 
offering is recognised.

Why this is important for LSEG
We are building a more efficient, 
scalable business and expanding 
underlying profitability over time. 
Excluding FX impacts related 
items we had guided to an 
EBITDA margin of around 48%  
in 2023. Longer term, we expect 
to increase our EBITDA margin 
over time.

Why this is important for LSEG
A key financial metric that is  
both central to our valuation  
and a significant element of 
employees’ performance-related 
remuneration. Growth in our  
AEPS reflects our degree of 
success in driving strong top-line 
performance, as well as managing 
costs including tax and interest, 
and capital allocation. 

Analysis
We delivered a 2023 adjusted 
EBITDA margin of 47.2%, with the 
year-on-year decline of 60bps 
primarily reflecting the full-year 
impact of recent acquisitions, 
costs relating to development  
of products with Microsoft and 
FX-related items.

Excluding FX-related items, we 
delivered an adjusted EBITDA 
margin of 47.7% (2022: 46.9%). We 
drove this underlying expansion 
through continued improvements 
in efficiency and scalability, in 
particular through modernisation 
of the infrastructure that supports 
our Data & Analytics offering. 

Excluding Acadia and movements 
in FX rates, our EBITDA margin 
was in line with guidance4. 

Analysis
Adjusted earnings per share 
(AEPS) from continuing operations 
was 323.9 pence. The 1.9% 
increase in AEPS year-on-year 
reflected growth in underlying 
profitability, partly offset by higher 
net finance expense due to 
additional interest expenses on 
floating rate borrowing and growth 
in depreciation which reflected 
our ongoing investment in the 
business and delivery of our 
synergy programmes.

Our adjusted effective tax rate 
was a little higher year-on-year, 
principally driven by the impact  
of a higher UK corporate tax rate 
from 1 April 2023. Share buybacks 
also reduced the average share 
count in 2023, which acted as  
a tailwind for AEPS. 

Why this is important for LSEG
By harnessing Refinitiv data to 
build new products and through 
cross-sell and distribution 
opportunities, we are 
demonstrating the value generated 
by the Refinitiv acquisition.  
In March 2023, we raised our 
target for runrate revenue 
synergies from £225 million to 
£350-400 million by the end of 
2025, incurring £550-600 million 
in costs to achieve.

Analysis
By the end of 2023, we had 
delivered £158 million of runrate 
revenue synergies, exceeding  
our target to double the 2022 
year-end figure of £68 million.

We have continued delivering 
synergies against three key 
categories. We’re cross-selling 
data products to new customers, 
such as the underlying pricing 
data behind FTSE Russell indices; 
enhancing existing products, for 
example by delivering enhanced 
analytics through Workspace;  
and utilising our data to build  
new products. We launched 72 
synergy-related products in 2023.

We have also launched our 
ecommerce platform, which  
we expect to deliver synergies 
through new sales.

Why this is important for LSEG
By successfully delivering against 
our cost synergy programme,  
we are demonstrating that the 
integration of Refinitiv has helped 
us build a more streamlined  
and efficient Group. In 2022,  
we increased our target  
from £350 million to at least  
£400 million of runrate cost 
synergies by the end of 2025.

Analysis
By the end of 2023, we had 
delivered £442 million of runrate 
cost synergies, surpassing our 
£400 million target two years 
ahead of schedule. To date,  
we have incurred total costs  
to achieve these synergies of  
£564 million, though there are a 
few more synergies to deliver in 
2025 to close out the programme. 

We primarily delivered these 
savings by consolidating our 
property footprint, closing data 
centres, renegotiating supplier 
agreements and deduplicating 
roles where appropriate. 

Even though the Refinitiv cost 
synergy programme is now largely 
complete, we will continue to 
deliver cost efficiencies as we 
improve profitability further.

2023 Non-Financial KPIs

Engagement index

At LSEG, we’re committed to creating  
an environment where diverse talent can  
thrive, and to driving the growth of a green  
and sustainable economy.

These five core non-financial KPIs measure  
our progress, but also help us highlight the 
areas where we can still improve.

These KPIs align to our Group  
Strategic Objectives (GSOs) which  
help determine Executive Director 
remuneration and performance- 
related pay for all employees.
Further detail on the GSO performance 
assessment can be found in our 
Directors’ Remuneration Report  
on pages 139 to 141.

For more detail on LSEG’s sustainability 
targets, including Equity, Diversity  
& Inclusion targets, refer to pages  
58 to 68.

Definition
Our engagement index reflects 
employee satisfaction, specifically 
the likelihood that colleagues 
would recommend LSEG as  
a great place to work.

Why this is important for LSEG
We recognise the importance of 
establishing a diverse, inclusive 
workplace where opinions can  
be openly shared, contributions 
recognised and individual and 
team achievements celebrated. 

Analysis
We saw stronger participation  
in this year’s Group-wide 
engagement survey, LSEG 
Engage, with 88% of colleagues 
taking part. The results showed 
engagement remained at the high 
levels seen in 2022, with a score 
of 75 (out of 100). The survey 
showed an improvement in our 
colleagues’ understanding of 
LSEG’s strategy, opportunities to 
learn and develop and support 
from their people leaders. Going 
forward, we need to continue 
addressing barriers to execution 
to better enable our employees. 
See page 24 of our 2023 
Sustainability Report1 for more 
information on the actions we  
are taking.

Gender diversity  
in leadership2

Definition
The proportion of female 
representation in senior 
leadership roles. 

Why this is important for LSEG
We strongly believe in promoting 
diverse gender representation 
across our organisation, ensuring 
we provide equal opportunity  
to progress to leadership roles, 
regardless of gender. We are 
committed to building a leadership 
team that incorporates a broad 
range of perspectives and 
management styles in order to 
make LSEG a better business.

Analysis
In 2023, we were proud to 
continue increasing female 
representation at senior 
leadership level to 42%. Our goal 
now is to maintain this level of 
representation above a minimum 
level of 40% over the next 
four-year period to 2027.

One of the key elements to  
our philosophy on diversity is to 
create equitable and inclusive 
processes that enable the 
attraction, retention and promotion 
of a global diverse pipeline  
of talent and this will remain  
an important area of focus  
going forward. 

1  Our 2023 Sustainability Report can be found on our website at www.lseg.com/en/

sustainability-strategy/disclosures-and-reports.

2  We have developed a new methodology to help us review our Equity, Diversity & Inclusion 
goals to ensure that they remain relevant and appropriate. More details can be found on 
page 61. LSEG collects ethnicity and gender data from our executive management and 
company board based on individual’s voluntary self-disclosure and their consent for the use 
of this data in company reporting. All company board and executive management gender 
data is collected on a global basis. Global ethnicity representation only includes colleagues 
based in countries where we collect ethnicity information.

3  The Green Economy Mark recognises London-listed companies and funds that derive more 

than 50% of their revenues from products and services that are contributing to environmental 
objectives such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, waste and pollution reduction 
and the circular economy. 

4  Reduction of Scope 1, Scope 2 (market based) and selected Scope 3 (business travel, home 
working , commuting, FERA) emissions vs a 2019 baseline. For 2023 reporting, we have 
expanded this metric to apply to all of the emissions within scope of our Climate Transition 
Plan (CTP). For more information on our CTP, refer to pages 63 and 64.

Carbon emissions4

Definition
The total number of issuers  
across the Green Economy Mark3, 
the Sustainable Bond Market  
and the Voluntary Carbon Market. 

Definition
The change in the amount of 
carbon emissions we produce as 
a direct result of Group activities, 
relative to our 2019 baseline. 

Why this is important for LSEG
We are committed to building a 
richly diverse team of leaders, 
recognising exceptional talent 
from a wide range of different 
backgrounds. This enables us  
to foster an environment where  
a blend of different perspectives 
goes into making the most 
important decisions for  
our business. 

Why this is important for LSEG
Stimulating the green economy is 
central to our purpose. We can 
measure the progress we are 
making here by tracking the 
overall level of issuer engagement 
in sustainable finance across the 
London Stock Exchange, with  
the goal of growing the number  
of issuers over time. 

Why this is important for LSEG
We are a member of the United 
Nations Climate Change ‘Race to 
Zero’ and we have set science-
based targets to reduce our 
carbon emissions with an ambition 
of reaching net zero by 2040.  
We aim to halve our operational 
emissions by 2030 from  
a 2019 baseline.

Analysis
With respect to underrepresented 
ethnic and racial groups, we did  
not achieve our goal of 20% 
representation within the leadership 
community, reaching 14% by the end 
of 2023. However, we remain firmly 
focused on closing this gap through 
a range of measures. We are 
continuing to grow the global 
Leadership Development 
programmes that we launched in 
2022 (eg Illuminate – targeted 
towards black and Latinx colleagues 
– and APAC Accelerator) and we 
introduced inclusive hiring training 
for all people leaders in 2023.  
Our revised goal is to ensure 25%  
of senior leadership roles are held 
by those from underrepresented 
groups by 2027.

Analysis
In 2023, we continued to facilitate 
increasing sustainable investment 
and growth in the green economy. 
As at the end of the year, we have 
236 total issuers across our 
Sustainable Bond Market and 
Voluntary Carbon Market or  
that proudly display the Green 
Economy Mark2, (2022: 217). In 
total, £232 billion has now been 
raised on our Sustainable Bond 
Market since inception.

FTSE Russell has also launched 
the UK ESG-Risk Adjusted Index 
Series and the FTSE Fixed Income 
EU Climate Benchmarks series  
to help investors integrate 
sustainability into their  
investment strategies.

Analysis
By the end of 2023, we had 
reduced our carbon emissions 
(Scope 1, Scope 2 (market based) 
and selected Scope 3) by -29% 
from a 2019 baseline.

Like many companies, we saw  
a steep reduction in our carbon 
emissions in 2020 and 2021, 
driven in large part by lockdowns 
and travel restrictions 
implemented as a result of the 
Covid-19 pandemic. As we have 
emerged from the pandemic  
and as the Group continues to 
grow, emissions have naturally 
increased, but we remain fully 
committed to our target to halve 
these emissions vs a 2019 
baseline by 2030.

A strategic partner to data and workflow providers
Although we often supply our data and analytics services to customers 
directly, we can also reach a significantly broader market by working 
with third-party data and workflow providers to help power their 
offerings. This is particularly relevant in the asset management  
industry, where there is a major structural trend towards the adoption  
of centralised enterprise technology platforms, such as Portfolio 
Management systems (PMS) and Enterprise Data Management (EDM) 
platforms. These platforms centralise many important, complex trading 
and investment operations and give management a better overarching 
view of their business. Naturally, they rely on the redistribution of 
high-quality content and that is where LSEG can be a trusted partner.

We’ve built a true working model 
strategically aligning across the  
two firms and having our teams 
work together to create a shared 
roadmap of innovation and new 
product development for the 
benefit of our mutual clients. 

Powering BlackRock’s workflow and ETF offering
One such example is BlackRock’s Aladdin, which has become the 
industry leader in the PMS space, combining sophisticated risk analytics 
with comprehensive portfolio management tools to power end-to-end 
workflows for over 100,000 investment professionals globally. LSEG  
is a key partner in the Aladdin ecosystem, and is the preferred data 
source for Fixed Income, Equity and public reference data. Meanwhile, 
BlackRock’s iShares suite has been a leader in the ETF marketplace  
for over 20 years. Through FTSE Russell, LSEG partners with BlackRock 
to help drive growth, providing key benchmarks, indices and ETFs. 
Today, there is over $430 billion in AUM tied to over 125 FTSE Russell 
products that help power the iShares suite.

We believe that the future of 
investment management and the 
future of technology are highly 
aligned, and our collaboration  
with LSEG is a core component  
of how we will ultimately deliver  
for client needs.

Significant expansion potential 
Third-party data distribution is a growing source of revenue for us,  
in particular because of the breadth of content and services that we’re 
now able to offer as a combined group. Historically, we have only 
maintained a handful of these partnerships with a small number of global 
providers. However, as we build out a cloud-based data architecture 
that lends itself more to redistribution, we’ll be looking to create many 
more of these relationships to power a growing number of partner 
applications worldwide.

incorporating a greater mix of asset classes, 
broadening the data and information required 
to manage portfolios and execute transactions. 
The extent of our coverage in both established 
and emerging asset classes creates value for 
our customers by simplifying workflows and 
critical processes.

Case study
Scope of asset class coverage within  
FTSE Russell 
We are a world-class provider of benchmark 
and index solutions, serving customers 
throughout the investment ecosystem.  
We provide globally recognised indices  
across several asset classes, including 
Equities, FX, Fixed Income, Sustainable 
Investment and Digital Assets. We are 
continuing to invest in our established asset 
classes, while leveraging our expertise from 
across the Group to selectively explore new 
asset classes – for example, our in private 
markets and in digital asset clearing.

Case study
Our global customer base, critical 
infrastructure and regulatory footprint
We are truly a global business, providing 
services to over 45,000 customers in over  
170 countries, with differentiated engagement 
models tailored to support their needs.  
These customers include 100 of the top  
100 global banks and 78 of the top 100 asset 
managers, with more than 400,000 end users. 
We provide solutions (many of which are highly 
regulated) that solve business critical issues  
for our customers, as we seek to create safer, 
more efficient and more liquid markets, and to 
reduce risk. As a result, we are overseen  
by regulators across the globe, and have  
built deep, long-standing relationships with  
these regulators. This allows us to better 
support our customers as they navigate 
complex regulatory environments and 
ever-changing requirements.

Seamlessly connected 

A trusted partner for customers, enabling 
connectivity across the financial markets  
value chain. We provide access to open 
platforms and venues which integrate 
seamlessly across the workflows that  
matter, from pre-trade decision-making,  
to trade execution and clearing.

Why is this important? 
Financial markets continue to evolve.  
The adoption of new technologies and 
changes in regulation impact the complexity 
and scope of our customers’ needs. By 
providing integrated solutions across the  
value chain, we are building deeper customer 
relationships and working in partnership to 
help customers address this complexity in  
a way that few other providers can.

Case study
NDF Trading and Clearing 
Our new NDF Matching platform combines 
LSEG’s capabilities across our three divisions; 
a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) for FX 
trading via LSEG Workspace that is fully 
integrated with LCH ForexClear. This delivers 
multiple benefits for our clients, including  
a genuine all-to-all market, improved 
transparency via a “cleared price” for the 
market, margin saving and capital benefits, 
safer and more accurate credit management 
and simpler administration. Hosting the venue 
in Singapore, brings customers latency 
improvements, leading to improved access  
to liquidity and delivery of the trading GUI  
in Workspace. We are delivering a more 
connected and efficient FX workflow for our 
clients via integration with LSEG’s capabilities 
in Data & Analytics. For more information on 
this and other initiatives in our Capital Markets 
division, see pages 38 and 39.

Our progress in 2023

Improving execution

Continuing delivery of Group Strategic Programmes

We are moving from integration to transformation with greater focus  
on growth, scaling our platforms and delivering customer outcomes.  
We have made steady progress across our transformation agenda: 
migrating customers to our strategic platforms, e.g. Workspace and 
Real-Time Optimised, improving order management, modernising our 
network and reducing time to market for the creation of new indices.

Progressing on resilience and cyber security initiatives

We continue to invest in the resiliency and security of our products and 
infrastructure, ensuring we uphold our duty to provide stability to the 
global financial ecosystem. This is embedded in our risk culture and 
reflective of our deep market infrastructure heritage. Our investment  
in resilience has seen technology key risk events reduce by ~58% in  
the last two years. It remains a key priority to minimise these events, 
such as the outages on the London Stock Exchange in 2023.

Delivering on the Sales Transformation journey

We have introduced a new solution selling team and targeted sales 
specialists for our high-touch customers, alongside actively developing 
our ecommerce strategy for our low-touch customers. Our account teams’ 
active engagement has resulted in 74%1 of customers connecting with  
us on new products and services, among whom we see better product 
satisfaction (+11pp)2 and higher likelihood to recommend (+73pp)3.

Embedding a high-performance culture

We created and launched new LSEG values to underpin our purpose 
and outline how we work with our customers, partners and together.  
Our senior leaders participate in masterclasses on high-performance, 
and our career navigator tool, launched globally this year, empowers 
development and progression. With refreshed EDI ambitions, priorities 
and practices, we are building belonging and inspiring our people to 
perform at their best.

Improving the customer experience

We have invested in and simplified our Data & Analytics offering, 
consolidating our product portfolio into integrated workflow solutions 
and moving from over 30+ legacy desktop variants down to just a 
handful for Workspace. Customer satisfaction scores have increased 
across a range of metrics including “powerful analytics” (+11pp)4,  
“ease of sharing news/analysis” (+13pp)4 and “functionality across 
multiple devices” (+11pp)4.

Investing in better products

Harnessing our integrated offering  
to create value greater than the  
“sum of the parts” 

Deploying Workspace across the Data & Analytics business

Driving value creation through aligned user experience

We have made significant improvements to our Workspace offering, 
integrating key customer workflow solutions including Advanced 
Dealing, TORA and SDC Platinum. We have also sent Eikon end  
of life letters to our customers, notifying them of the sunsetting of  
Eikon in 2025. 

We have simplified our global branding, making it easier for our 
customers to discover and access the full range of capabilities that  
we offer through improved awareness. This involved retiring our  
Refinitiv brand and creating six new sub brands: LSEG Data & Analytics; 
LSEG Risk Intelligence; FTSE Russell; London Stock Exchange; LSEG FX;  
and LSEG Post Trade. This unification of branding will allow us to better 
cross-sell across our customer base and create more holistic, deeper 
client relationships.

Unlocking business growth by investing in technology

Executing on the LSEG Microsoft Partnership, enabling new growth 
and scale

We are investing in the infrastructure of our world-class indices business 
through an index refactoring programme (IRF) and automation to 
facilitate speed to market and meet market demands for customisation. 
We are also enhancing our distribution capabilities to enable our 
customers to receive data in the way that best meets their needs  
(API and cloud solutions).

We have made excellent progress in mobilising our people to work 
effectively in cross-firm teams with Microsoft and to build innovative 
products together. We expect that our first solutions will become 
available in the first half of 2024. For more information on our 
partnership with Microsoft, see page 19.

Partnering with customers to develop “next-gen” products

Exploring innovation in high growth areas

We launched our Design Partner Programme (DPP), where together  
with Microsoft we are collaborating with some of our largest customers 
to design and build products which address their pain points and 
support their key workflows. 

Pivoting toward agile commercial models to support shift to cloud

For some of our largest customers we are replacing product-level 
agreements with enterprise-wide agreements, creating cost benefits  
for them, whilst driving value for both our customers and LSEG.  
See page 33 for more on how this is coming to life with one of our 
largest strategic partners, HSBC.

We announced our ambition to be the first global exchange group to 
deliver a seamless funding continuum, by supporting private and public 
markets through a globally connected market infrastructure and being  
a trusted partner in providing access to data and insights. This year,  
we have focused on two key aspects: 1) our continuing partnership  
with fintech Floww to establish our presence in the private markets 
space; and 2) our work towards the creation of a new market under UK 
regulation that makes it easier for private companies to raise funding.

Our purpose and strategy continued

Evolving priorities for 2024 and beyond

We continue to be well positioned to capitalise 
on the strong underlying growth drivers of  
our business. 

In 2024, our priorities will evolve as we  
continue our transformation and start to  
realise the opportunities created by it:

Executing on the transformation

To execute on the transformation, we are focused on the continued 
delivery of our Group Strategic Programmes, including upgrading our 
tech platforms and the progression of our cloud migration. As our sales 
transformation journey continues to take shape in 2024, we are also 
transforming the organisational and operational structure of our  
Data & Analytics businesses, separating out FTSE Russell and Risk 
Intelligence. Underlying all this Group-wide change is a continued  
focus on ensuring cost and capital discipline. 

Monetising the integrated business

We are focused on the delivery of our commercial transformation and 
continued price realisation of our integrated business, whilst continuing 
to unify and improve the customer experience. We are bringing together 
our FX capabilities across pre-trade, at-trade and post-trade in a more 
connected and seamless offering for customers, all under the LSEG  
FX brand. We are institutionalising this ‘One LSEG’ approach across 
other asset classes and focusing on driving synergies with Tradeweb 
through continued collaboration.

Launching new products and creating  
new markets

Across the Group we are constantly looking for areas where we  
can create new products and services. Through our partnership with 
Microsoft we have three strategic initiatives in Workspace, Analytics  
and Data Intelligence, enabling product development within these areas. 
Moreover, in 2024 our vision for Post Trade Solutions will start to come 
to life, helping customers drive down cost of capital and trading. We are 
expanding our presence in private markets, and building asset-agnostic, 
interoperable, digital market infrastructure to drive efficiencies across 
the trade lifecycle.

Our strategy is clear as we look 
ahead to the next phase of our 
transformation in 2024 and 
beyond. We will continue to put  
our customers at the centre of how 
we grow, partnering with them to 
create innovative products and 
services, allowing us to make  
more possible together.

There is still work to do,  
but through the actions we have 
taken we are now well positioned 
to deliver sustainable growth  
into the future, unlocking exciting 
opportunities in partnership  
with our customers to create 
shared value.

LSEG is a long-term trusted partner 
of HSBC and provides us with the 
core market data we need to run 
our business. 

The addition of Refinitiv to  
LSEG’s portfolio brought new 
capabilities that help boost  
HSBC’s competitive advantage.

The unique combination of  
HSBC’s expertise, LSEG’s data  
and analytics, and Microsoft’s 
infrastructure is helping us to get 
great results now and build the 
right solutions for the future.

John Hinshaw
Chief Operating Officer, HSBC

Partnering with HSBC continued

Co-creating value with customers  
like HSBC 

A strategic partner to our customers
Since the acquisition of Refinitiv, we have spent three years building  
a global, seamless, multi-asset class offering that spans the trade  
lifecycle end-to-end. With the breadth of our services and the strength 
of our longstanding relationships, we have elevated our customer 
conversations to a strategic level, working with the C-suite to deliver 
value throughout their workflows. Based on demand from our largest 
customers, we are increasingly offering enterprise-wide deals that 
provide the benefits of one efficient contract and greater certainty 
around pricing. Often, these customers will work with several hundred 
data providers. By engaging closely with the customer, we can  
better understand their needs and displace a number of these 
providers, generating significant cost efficiencies for the customer 
through consolidation.

Creating value alongside HSBC
Our enterprise-wide deal with HSBC, one of the world’s largest banks,  
is one example. Through this deal, over 750 terminals were switched  
to LSEG Workspace and we significantly expanded our provision of 
real-time data across the HSBC group. By rationalising its portfolio  
of data vendors, we have generated significant cost savings for  
HSBC – over $43 million per year. We are also partnering on bespoke 
solutions to drive growth for HSBC, and recently the bank launched  
a next-generation digital wealth management portal that is powered by 
our data and underlying tech workflow. Additionally, HSBC has joined 
our Design Partner Programme with Microsoft and the HSBC team is 
providing valuable input into product development decisions as we 
build the data and analytics solutions of the future.

Delivering growth for LSEG
As well as delivering value for our customers, these partnerships also 
generate attractive commercial results for LSEG. In the case of HSBC, 
we have taken an account that had been declining and turned it into 
one that is now growing at over c.4% per year. Invariably we find that 
these deals act as a foundation for further value creation as we look for 
ways to build on the initial partnership through cross-sell opportunities. 
HSBC is now consistently one of our top-performing accounts and our 
relationship continues to go from strength to strength.

2023 Highlights

Accelerating revenue growth in 2023
We continued to accelerate growth in our Data & Analytics business this 
year, up from 3.8%1 organic in 2022 to 6.7%1 organic in 2023. Growth in 
our Annual Subscription Value (the annualised value of our subscription 
contracts) is up 370bps since the acquisition of Refinitiv.

Over the past three years, we have focused on partnering with  
our customers to better understand their needs and build stronger 
relationships, and on incentivising our salespeople more effectively  
by, among other things, setting net (rather than gross) sales targets. 
These improvements in operational execution have been key in 
delivering the incremental growth to-date, largely through significantly 
higher product retention.

This year, we increased the magnitude of our annual price review for the 
first time since the Refinitiv acquisition. This drove approximately 100bps 
of incremental growth in 2023 and was largely well accepted by our 
customers who recognise the improvements we are making to our 
offering and the overall user experience we deliver.

Workspace rollout progressing well
We have continued to make great progress with the rollout of 
Workspace, our next-generation data and workflow solution that 
combines cutting-edge technology with market-leading content sets, 
delivering a best-in-class experience for customers across trading, 
banking, portfolio management and wealth advisory.

Through Workspace, users can access our leading data, analytics 
and news, covering multiple asset classes and all from highly  
trusted sources.

Workspace is:
 — Frictionless – delivering a seamless experience across devices 

with quick installation and deployment.

 — Intuitive – highly customisable and easy to navigate with predictive 

discovery powered by generative AI.

 — Connected – integrated with functionality from across our offering 
(e.g. TORA) to deliver powerful workflow solutions, while open 
infrastructure allows customers to plug in their own data and tools.

Customer feedback has been improving strongly, with Workspace 
scoring higher than its predecessor product Eikon on a number of key 
satisfaction metrics. We have also continued to improve Workspace  
on a regular and ongoing basis, delivering double-digit increases to 
customer experience scores that track “ease of sharing news and 
analysis” and “power of analytics”. In 2023 alone, we launched over  
380 updates to the product.

The rollout is progressing well and we expect to have migrated the vast 
majority of customers by the end of 2024. In August, we announced that 
we will permanently sunset Eikon in 2025.

1  Growth rates are on a constant currency, organic basis. 2022 growth excludes the impact  

of the Russia/Ukraine War.

36

Tradeweb/FTSE Russell partnership
Our relationship with Tradeweb continues to go from strength to 
strength as we look for ways to utilise our joint offering to create 
innovative and high-quality solutions for our customers. In October 
2023, we announced a strategic partnership between Tradeweb and 
FTSE Russell, to develop the next generation of fixed income pricing 
and index trading products. We will use FTSE Russell’s innovative fixed 
income index solutions and Tradeweb’s trading platform and data 
capabilities to:
 — Expand benchmark pricing across a wider range of regions and fixed 
income asset classes, building on the recently launched European 
Government bond pricing.

 — Explore incorporating Tradeweb pricing into FTSE Fixed Income 

indices, starting with the FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI).
 — Expand and enhance electronic trading functionality for FTSE Russell 

Fixed Income indices and customised baskets.

LSEG and Tradeweb also signed a new market data licensing 
agreement, offering customers the benefits of LSEG’s distribution,  
reach and technology alongside Tradeweb’s growing suite of valuable 
market data.

Partnering with Microsoft to empower the future of financial markets
In December 2022, we announced a long-term strategic partnership 
with Microsoft to co-innovate solutions that will transform the data, 
analytics and workflow experience in financial services, and enable  
us to accelerate value creation for our customers.

2023 progress:
 — Our new cloud environment build is well advanced, with the first 

migrations already under way. Already, over 250 million analytical 
calculations are now run daily on Azure, with more being added.
 — We have been engaging with major customers through the Design 

Partner Programme.

 — We announced that early product enhancements and new 

applications will begin to launch in H1 2024.

Upcoming product launches:
 — Meeting Prep – a Microsoft Teams app that will automatically 

generate meeting preparation summaries and insights, pulling from 
LSEG’s financial data and relevant content in Microsoft 365 including 
documents, emails and chats. Pilots will begin in 2024.

 — Open Directory – chat and collaboration experience with open 
access across financial services user communities – through 
Workspace Messenger, Microsoft Teams and other chat interfaces. 
Pilots will begin in 2024.

 — LSEG Workspace/Microsoft interoperability – enabling users to 
seamlessly access, discover and share content across LSEG 
Workspace and the Microsoft 365 productivity suite. Pilots will 
begin in 2024.

 — LSEG AI Insights – launch of a proprietary Q&A interface helping 

end users gain instantaneous answers to questions summarised from 
underlying documents and enriched with the latest data and analytics. 
The first pilots will focus on fund analytics with Lipper, and fixed 
income analytics powered by Yield Book.

 — Data-as-a-Service – a new solution powered by Microsoft Fabric that 
will enable customers to easily discover, interrogate, administer and 
integrate our financial data and content. Pilots will begin in 2024.

partnership with Microsoft,

enhancing Tradeweb’s offering. This includes expanding Tradeweb’s 
presence globally – in particular across EM and APAC regions –  
and driving increased adoption of portfolio trading by building out  
the functionality that Tradeweb’s platform can offer.

In 2023, Tradeweb announced two acquisitions that further this strategy:
 — r8fin – a technology provider that specialises in algorithmic-based 

execution for US Treasuries and interest rate futures, helping 
Tradeweb reach a new and differentiated level of intelligent execution 
through a powerful combination of algorithmic technology and 
cross-market connectivity. The acquisition of r8fin closed in  
January 2024.

 — Yieldbroker – a leading Australian trading platform for Australian  

and New Zealand government bonds and interest rate derivatives 
covering the institutional and wholesale client sectors. The acquisition 
of Yieldbroker closed in August 2023.

Plugging FX capabilities into our workflow offering
New NDF Matching platform launched
In November 2023, LSEG FX launched a new NDF Matching venue in 
Singapore, the first deliverable of the FX Venues re-platforming initiative. 
This venue supports the demand for NDF central limit order book 
market infrastructure in Asia and around the globe, including from 
LSEG’s network of over 5,000 FX trading desktop users in the region.  
It also brings to market a trading platform on which a broader array of 
market participants can agree to clear their NDFs on a pre-trade basis 
with LCH ForexClear. Cleared settlement brings innovation to the FX 
space, including improved liquidity, simplified credit management,  
lower costs and easier adoption by non-bank participants.

Tradeweb/FXall interconnectivity
Tradeweb in collaboration with FXall this year launched an innovative 
solution to help institutional investors trade Emerging Markets bonds 
more efficiently. The new FX Swap Workflow solution allows mutual 
clients of Tradeweb and FXall to buy or sell an EM bond and then 
seamlessly hedge the local currency risk by executing an FX swap  
trade via direct connectivity to FXall.

Increasing the attractiveness of the London Stock Exchange  
as a listing venue
There are a wide range of reforms to the UK’s Capital Markets 
underway, on which we continue to engage extensively, both directly 
and through the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce (CMIT). These 
reforms include changes to the UK Listing Rules; Prospectus rules;  
how investment research is funded and procured; and Corporate 
Governance, as well as measures to increase the availability of risk 
capital being deployed into UK Capital Markets. These reforms are 
expected to begin to be implemented from the middle of 2024 with  
an active policy agenda into 2025. 

Equities £227m 15%
FX £251m 16%
Fixed Income, Derivatives & Other £1,068m 69%

We offer our customers extensive access to capital markets and liquidity 
across multiple asset classes. We operate a broad range of international 
equity, fixed income, exchange-traded funds and products and foreign 
exchange markets. We are home to several capital formation and 
execution venues: the London Stock Exchange, AIM, Turquoise, FXall, 
Matching and Tradeweb. The division is split into three areas:

Equities
Capital raising and trading venues for equities. A trusted long-term 
partner to the market and the #1 exchange by capital raised in Europe.

Structural market trends driving growth:
 — Globalisation.
 — Electronic trading.
 — Pipeline of PE-backed businesses seeking next stage of investment.

Performance: 
-8.8% as subdued market volatility fed through to lower Secondary 
Markets activity.

FX
A market leader in dealer-to-client and dealer-to-dealer FX trading,  
we provide electronic trading, workflow and data to the institutional 
foreign exchange community through FXall and FX Matching.

Structural market trends driving growth:
 — Access to liquidity.
 — Cross-border trading and business globalisation.

Performance: 
-1.9% – weaker interbank FX activity, particularly in H2 2023,  
adversely impacted volumes on our dealer-focused Matching platform. 
Our dealer-to-client platform, FXall, also saw lower activity from  
buyside participants.

Fixed Income, Derivatives & Other
Electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets 
products, built and operated through Tradeweb.

Structural market trends driving growth:
 — Electronification of fixed income markets.
 — Expanding global markets.

Performance: 
+12.1%, accelerating over the year as risk appetite returned to markets, 
building on structural tailwinds from the ongoing electronification of 
trading and Tradeweb’s continued share gains in key product lines. 
Tradeweb made further progress in international markets with the 
acquisition of Yieldbroker (see 2023 highlights opposite). Tradeweb also 
announced the acquisition of algorithmic execution technology business 
r8fin, which closed in January 2024.

Revenue split

OTC Derivatives £517m 44%
Securities & Reporting £254m 22%
Non-Cash Collateral £107m 9%
Net Treasury Income £289m 25%

We operate global, critically important clearing infrastructure, serving 
customers in more than 60 countries and clearing across multiple asset 
classes and in 27 currencies. We help customers optimise financial 
resource consumption, satisfy their regulatory reporting obligations and 
manage and optimise credit risk, while reducing operational complexity 
and cost. Increasingly, we are extending this support across the  
value chain, collaborating across the Group to deliver seamless 
interoperability with our Capital Markets and Data & Analytics offerings.

We are well positioned in the context of key structural market growth 
trends: increasing regulation for our customers and rising demand  
for both risk management and capital optimisation solutions. Market 
volatility is also an important driver of performance, and in 2023, rising 
global inflation and shifting expectations around timing of interest rate 
moves contributed to heightened clearing volumes, particularly in H1. 
We are also driving strong underlying performance, in part through the 
expansion of our global network — particularly in EMEA and Asia —  
and we’re enhancing our product offering to secure long-term growth.

The division is split across four reporting segments:

OTC Derivatives
Clearing and capital optimisation solutions for OTC Derivatives,  
including interest rate swaps, foreign exchange and credit default 
swaps. The largest of these services is SwapClear, which is responsible 
for over 90% of the global interest rate swap notional cleared.

Performance: 
+28.9%, partly reflecting the benefit of acquisitions. Organic growth of 
13.9% was also strong, with uncertainty around the timing and scale  
of Central Bank interest rate moves driving increased client clearing 
activity in SwapClear. We also generated £18 million of revenue helping 
customers through US reference rate reform and delivered double-digit 
revenue growth in both FX and CDS clearing.

Securities & Reporting
Securities clearing, capital optimisation and regulatory  
reporting solutions.

Performance: 
+7.0% as fees received due to the early termination of the Euronext 
clearing agreement more than offset the impact of lost cash equity 
clearing revenues. We expect some additional revenue attrition in  
2024 as Euronext transition their remaining clearing activities. 
RepoClear continued to grow well.

Non-Cash Collateral
Fees are earned from handling non-cash collateral balances.

Net Treasury Income (NTI)
Income earned on cash deposited with LCH as margin and default funds 
as part of the risk management process.

Performance: 
+12.8% – as interest margins benefited from money market trends. 
Higher levels of cash collateral year-on-year were also supportive in  
the first half, but moderated in the second half as balances normalised.

2023 Highlights

A trusted partner to the markets 
Delivering strong growth, supported by interest rate volatility
As central banks around the world grappled to contain rising inflation  
in 2023, we saw unprecedented market volatility driven by interest rate 
uncertainty – particularly in the first half – and this helped to drive 
double-digit growth at SwapClear and in our NTI. 

As we exit a period in which interest rates have hovered close to zero 
for over a decade, we are seeing a spike in interest rate hedging activity 
as customers look to secure their positions. In general, such market 
volatility tends to be positive for Post Trade activity and we saw similarly 
elevated volumes in 2022, partly also driven by geopolitical uncertainty. 

As a leading and trusted provider of clearing and risk management 
services, and with deep cleared liquidity pools across interest rate 
swaps, CDS, FX, Equities and Repos, we are well positioned to support 
customers through times of uncertainty like this.

Supporting customers through interest rate reform
Following the FCA’s decision to retire the London Interbank Offered 
Rate (LIBOR), we have been actively supporting customers to transition 
their existing swaps contracts away from LIBOR and onto alternative 
risk-free reference rates. US dollar LIBOR, the most significant of the 
outgoing rates, ceased to be published in June 2023 and so there has 
been a significant market effort this year to transition these contracts 
while providing seamless continuity to customers and removing the 
need for them to take more expensive individual actions.

Across April and May 2023, we converted c.600,000 trades into SOFR 
equivalents for over 1,300 member and client accounts, representing 
c.$45 trillion in notional – also generating £18 million in fees for LSEG. 
Throughout this process, there has been no market disruption and 
customer feedback has been positive.

Targeting long-term growth through Post Trade Solutions
In 2023, we have made excellent progress in building out our Post 
Trade Solutions offering, designed to help our customers reduce  
their balance sheet risk by optimising their use of capital. 

As changing regulation increases the incentive to clear some trades, 
there is a growing need for banks to determine the most cost-effective 
counterparty strategy, and our expertise will be vital in that process.  
With the services we are building and have acquired (Quantile and 
Acadia) we will be able to analyse a customer’s trade portfolio and 
determine the best treatment for each transaction, processing cleared 
trades through LCH and uncleared margin and trades through Acadia 
and SwapAgent, while also providing customers with significant 
compression and capital optimisation benefits through Quantile.  
We’re very excited about the opportunity here and we have a number  
of new organic services in the pipeline.

Performance: 
+7.5% as customers worked to optimise their collateral and clearing 
volumes grew.

and how we’re meeting it on page 43.

seeking to import best practices 
and innovation from the cleared 
markets to the uncleared markets. 

As a result, I anticipate that the

Partnering through Post Trade Solutions continued

Helping our customers achieve capital  
and operational efficiencies through  
Post Trade Solutions 

The capital crunch
Our customers are facing a persistent challenge, as they struggle to 
maintain efficiency and deliver healthy returns at a time when capital 
requirements and funding costs are soaring for OTC derivatives. 
Increased regulatory focus, including the introduction of SA-CCR1,  
is driving up costs and compelling banks to be more efficient with  
their financial resources so they can continue delivering for their  
clients. While the capital crunch impacts both cleared and bilateral 
portfolios, the latter also face significant operational hurdles including 
inconsistencies in contracting, reporting and dispute resolution  
which can create friction across the post trade lifecycle.

Building a world-class financial resource management offering
We are tackling our customers’ key pain points through Post Trade 
Solutions. By combining several innovative businesses, we are bringing 
the clearing experience of LCH to the uncleared space – driving down 
the expense of capital and delivering significant efficiencies for our 
customers. Post Trade Solutions streamlines workflows, data, risk 
management and optimisation via:
 — SwapAgent – designed to simplify the processing, margining and 

settlement of non-cleared OTC derivatives, including cross-currency 
swaps and swaptions. Over time, we intend to expand these services 
to a broader range of uncleared derivatives including FX and CDS.

 — Quantile (acquired 2022) – a provider of financial resource 

optimisation services, helping to reduce gross notional, margin and 
capital requirements by reducing and rebalancing exposures.

 — Acadia (acquired 2023) – a provider of standardised collateral and 

multi-asset class workflow capabilities for uncleared OTC derivatives, 
reducing costs and complexity through process optimisation.

By bringing this industry-leading expertise under one roof, we will 
accelerate the launch of new innovations that respond to our customers’ 
needs and add further value across the post trade lifecycle.

Launched “FX Smart Clearing”
A recent example of Post Trade Solutions in action is “FX Smart 
Clearing”, a service that launched in 2023 and has the potential  
to revolutionise OTC FX. By using Quantile’s proven optimisation 
techniques to identify FX Forwards for clearing – available through  
LCH Forexclear – participants can significantly reduce their capital 
requirements and counterparty risk while also benefitting from 
multi-lateral trade compression. In a proof-of-concept, 19 participating 
banks achieved an average reduction in capital requirements of 51% 
without increasing initial margin significantly, and we believe there is 
scope to increase this to over 70% as the network and products grow.

Medium-term guidance

1. Revenue 
Mid to high single-digit organic growth 
annually, accelerating after 2024.

2. EBITDA margin 
Underlying margin to increase  
over time.

3. Capex 
Remain around current levels  
of 11-12% of income in 2024,  
then declining over time to  
high single-digit % of income.

4. Cash conversion 
Cumulative free cash flow to exceed 
adjusted profit after tax attributable  
to equity holders.

Chief Financial Officer review continued

2023 in review
We delivered strong top-line growth of 7.8%2 on a reported basis,  
and 8.3% on a constant currency basis in 2023, with underlying margin 
expansion of 110 basis points. The annual dividend increased 7.5%,  
and a further £1.2 billion of excess capital was returned to shareholders 
in share buybacks.

We have demonstrated a strong performance against the long-term 
targets we announced with the Refinitiv acquisition. We delivered 
organic income growth of 6.5% CAGR1 against a target of 5-7% growth, 
as well as ongoing underlying expansion of our adjusted EBITDA 
margin. We have achieved our cost synergies two years ahead of  
plan against an upgraded target, and are on track to deliver revenue 
synergies, also against an upgraded target. 

New medium-term guidance
1. Accelerating growth – a step-up in growth expectations to mid to 
high single-digit organic revenue growth annually, accelerating after 
2024 as customers start to benefit from our investment in major 
platforms and the Microsoft partnership. 

We have several structural growth drivers that underpin our business.  
In addition, we have opportunities to grow our market share. 

The strategic combination of LSEG and Refinitiv continues to deliver 
revenue synergies, and through our sales transformation we are able  
to have more effective conversations with our customers. 

With regards to pricing, as we improve the value of our services for  
our customers; are more disciplined with the implementation of our  
price reviews; and over time, move to a usage based pricing model,  
we see lots of opportunity here.

We continue to develop new products and instil a real rhythm of 
innovation and collaboration with customers. We also see opportunities 
in new asset classes like private markets and digital assets alongside 
geographic expansion.

The Microsoft partnership increases the potential for every one of  
these levers, enabling new and adjacent market opportunities.

2. Improving profitability – underlying EBITDA margin to increase over 
time, as the benefit from top-line growth more than offsets underlying 
inflation and our reinvestments in growth. 

Our Capital Markets and Post Trade divisions are scaled businesses,  
but we see opportunity for further margin improvement in our  
Data & Analytics business as we build an efficient and scalable 
technology platform.

3. Sustained investment – total capex (including Refinitiv integration) 
will remain around current levels of 11-12% of income² in 2024, then 
decline over time to high single-digit % of income² as integration  
related spend ceases.

We have been investing heavily in our business to address historical 
underinvestment in the Refinitiv business, to integrate the LSEG and 
Refinitiv businesses, and to build new capabilities to drive future growth. 

4. Strong cash conversion – cumulative free cash flow to exceed 
adjusted profit after tax attributable to equity holders.

Our business is highly cash generative, and as integration spend  
ceases after 2025, our cash conversion will improve.

1  Organic, constant currency income (excl. recoveries) growth, excluding deferred revenue 
accounting adjustment in 2021 and 2022, and the impact of Russia/Ukraine war in 2022.

4. Share buyback – £1.2 billion
We remain very focused on capital discipline and will, from time  
to time, return excess capital to shareholders to the extent that we  
stay within our leverage range. The £1.2 billion returned during 2023 
reflected £450 million of on-market buybacks to complete the original 
£750 million programme announced in August 2022, and a £750 million 
buyback directed at the holding of the former Refinitiv shareholders, 
which we executed in September 2023.

Looking ahead, we intend to complete up to £1 billion of additional share 
buybacks during 2024, which we intend to acquire directly from entities 
owned by certain investment funds affiliated with Blackstone, an affiliate 
of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, an affiliate of GIC Special 
Investments Pte. Ltd, and by Thomson Reuters (collectively, the former 
Refinitiv shareholders). We believe this structure is in the best interests 
of all shareholders. As part of this, we are seeking permission from  
LSEG shareholders to renew the authority for directed buybacks at  
this year’s AGM in April 2024.

Capital allocation split

Capex – £1.0 billion
M&A – £618 million
Dividend – £611 million
Share buyback – £1.2 billion

Chief Financial Officer review continued

Capital allocation
Our goal is to invest for growth using the cash we generate, building  
a platform for long-term capital appreciation while rewarding investors 
today through a progressive dividend, growing broadly in line with 
adjusted earnings per share (AEPS). 

We allocate capital within appropriate leverage bounds for our earnings 
profile, and during the course of 2023 the Group moved to target  
a leverage range of 1.5-2.5x operating net debt to adjusted EBITDA 
before foreign exchange gains or losses (previously 1.0-2.0x). Our 
intention is to maintain business-as-usual leverage around the middle  
of this range. Leverage at the end of December 2023 remained at  
1.8x (December 2022: 1.8x).

LSEG generated £3.2 billion in operating cash flow in 2023, which we 
deployed as follows

1. Capex – £1.0 billion
Business-as-usual capex, on an accrued constant currency basis, was 
£745 million. We continued to focus on programmes to support growth, 
efficiency and resilience. Our growth investments touch every part of 
our business given the breadth of opportunity in front of us. Key growth 
programmes ongoing during 2023 included Workspace product 
development, continued investment in Tradeweb, the replatforming of 
the FTSE Russell index business and the development of Post Trade 
Solutions. In addition, we began our joint product investments with 
Microsoft and continued to upgrade our own infrastructure to provide 
increased capacity, greater agility and better resilience. 

In addition to these investments, and in line with our guidance, we 
incurred a further £230 million of integration capex on an accrued  
basis, the vast majority of which was related to delivering the synergies 
relating to the Refinitiv acquisition. Total capex on a cash basis was 
£1,031 million.

2. M&A – £618 million
In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Acadia, which 
significantly enhances our risk management, margining and collateral 
optimisation capabilities across asset classes, particularly in the 
uncleared derivatives space. Together with the 2022 acquisition  
of Quantile, and our existing SwapAgent business, it will form the 
backbone of our Post Trade Solutions platform described above.  
Its services are of growing strategic importance to our customers  
and we are well positioned to develop and scale them in a way that is 
highly complementary to our existing Post Trade offering. For more 
information on Acadia and Post Trade Solutions – see page 43.

We also extended Tradeweb’s geographical footprint through the 
acquisition of Yieldbroker in Australia.

3. Dividends – £611 million
The proposed final dividend for 2023 is 79.3 pence – giving a total for 
the year of 115.0 pence, up 7.5% on 2022. This is consistent with our 
dividend policy and reflects a payout ratio of 36% of AEPS. The total 
cash outflow for the year was £611 million, comprising the 2022 final 
dividend and the 2023 interim dividend. 

From 2024, our policy is to pay a progressive dividend with a pay-out 
ratio of 33-40% of full-year AEPS, with the interim dividend set at around 
one-third of the expected full-year dividend.

Revised reporting structure to better reflect  
our business

From Q1 2024, we will be revising our reporting structure to align 
divisional disclosures with management reporting lines. These changes 
primarily impact the Data & Analytics division. 

For the new Data & Analytics perimeter, revenues will be grouped by 
product types under three business lines:
 — Workflows – consolidates all of our user interface businesses, 
comprising Trading & Banking, plus the desktop activities  
previously reported within Investment Solutions and Wealth.
 — Data & Feeds – consolidates all of our data businesses and 
comprises Enterprise Data, plus the data and feeds activities 
previously reported within Investment Solutions and Wealth. 

 — Analytics – previously reported within Investment Solutions.

The revised grouping allows for better identification of underlying trends in 
products and usage, rather than focusing on user groups or communities.

Benchmark & Indices will be split out from Investment Solutions and  
be renamed FTSE Russell as a separate division. Similarly, Customer  
& Third-Party Risk will also become a stand-alone division, and be 
renamed Risk Intelligence.

There will be no change to our Capital Markets or Post Trade reporting.

The financial review contains revenues, costs, earnings on a continuing basis, and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the twelve months ended 31 December 2023. FY 2023 is compared against 
FY 2022 on a statutory basis. Constant currency variances are calculated on the basis of consistent FX rates applied across the current and prior year period. Organic growth is calculated on a 
constant currency basis, adjusting the results to remove disposals from the entirety of the current and prior year periods, and by including acquisitions from the date of acquisition with a comparable 
adjustment to the prior year. Within the financial information and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes.
1  Recoveries relate to fees for third-party content, such as exchange data, that is distributed directly to customers.
2  Weighted average number of shares used to calculate basic earnings per share and adjusted basic earnings per share from continuing operations is 548 million (2022: 557 million).
3  The Group reports adjusted operating expenses before depreciation, amortisation and impairment, adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA), 
adjusted depreciation, amortisation and impairment, adjusted operating profit and adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS). These measures are not measures of performance under IFRS and 
should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, IFRS measures of financial performance and liquidity. Adjusted performance measures provide supplemental data relevant to  
an understanding of the Group’s financial performance and exclude non-underlying items of income and expense that are material by their size and/or nature. Non-underlying items include: 
amortisation and impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, incremental amortisation and impairment of the fair value adjustments of intangible assets recognised as a result 
of acquisitions, tax on non-underlying items and other income or expenses not considered to drive the operating results of the Group (including transaction, integration and separation costs 
related to acquisitions and disposals of businesses), as well as restructuring costs.

Total Income excluding recoveries of £8,009 million grew 8.3% on a constant currency basis, and included a 120bp benefit from acquisitions during 
the year. Growth on a reported basis was 7.8%. Total Income including recoveries of £8,379 million was up 8.1% in constant currency, and 8.2% higher 
on a reported basis. This growth was driven by good performance across all three divisions.

Adjusted operating expenses before depreciation, amortisation and impairment of £3,474 million, included £42 million of FX-related items  
(2022: £68 million credit). Constant currency cost growth of 7.7% includes the in-year impact of acquisitions. Organic cost growth of 5.3% reflected 
ongoing cost discipline, strong delivery of Refinitiv-related synergies and other efficiency gains. Our main costs relate to our people, with staff  
costs of £2,085 million (2022: £1,896 million) incorporating an average salary increase of 6% for the year. IT costs amounted to £607 million  
(2022: £567 million) with professional fees of £404 million (2022: £420 million).

Adjusted EBITDA of £3,777 million increased 8.6% in constant currency. EBITDA margin was 60bps lower year-on-year at 47.2% reflecting investment 
in the Microsoft partnership, the in-year impact of acquisitions and the FX-related opex items noted above. Improvements in efficiency and scalability 
drove a 110bp improvement in underlying EBITDA margin. Within EBITDA, income from Equity Investments was £15 million in 2023, up 25% from the 
prior year following a meaningful increase in dividend payments from Euroclear.

Reported depreciation, amortisation and impairment of £2,143 million (2022: £1,900 million) includes £1,228 million (2022: £1,078 million) related to 
the amortisation of purchased intangible assets (mainly Refinitiv) as well as other non-underlying charges. Excluding these, adjusted depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment of £915 million grew by 10.7%. Our continued investment in technology and new services and the capex associated with 
achieving the Refinitiv synergies was the main driver of this increase. In addition, we saw an impact from our move to an agile working methodology, 
with depreciation of multi-release investment programmes now recognised earlier, and a greater proportion of capex was assigned a three-year 
useful economic life.

Reported Operating Profit of £1,371 million was 3.2% lower, mostly due to higher amortisation, including purchased intangible assets. Adjusted 
Operating Profit of £2,862 million grew 7.9% with the strong income growth and cost discipline highlighted above partially offset by higher 
depreciation and amortisation. 

Transaction costs of £85 million mainly relate to fees and other charges incurred from acquisition activity during the year, as well as awards and 
incentive plans linked to previous acquisitions. Integration, separation and restructuring costs have mostly been incurred in relation to the integration 
of Refinitiv and are in line with previous guidance. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment of intangibles and other assets of £1,228 million mainly 
arise from the Refinitiv acquisition, with some additional amortisation associated with recent acquisitions.

Net Finance Expense/Tax/Non-Controlling Interest 
Adjusted Net Finance Expense was £170 million (2022: £160 million), and £176 million (2022: £176 million) on a reported basis. Following a change  
in presentation, Net Finance Expense now includes foreign exchange gains or losses on corporate treasury activities previously included as an 
operating expense. These movements represented a £30 million charge in 2023 and mostly reflected interest rate differentials on FX hedges1.  
Of this, £16 million was previously included in operating expenses in H1 2023.

An increase in interest rates drove greater interest income on cash and cash equivalents during the period, which was more than offset by 
additional interest expenses on floating rate borrowing and the £30 million additional FX charge.

Reported Profit Before Tax decreased 3.7%, to £1,195 million from £1,241 million in 2022 as higher income was more than offset by an increase in 
operating expenses and a higher depreciation and amortisation expense. Adjusted Profit Before Tax increased by 4.8% in the year to £2,692 million 
(2022: £2,568 million) as EBITDA growth more than offset the increase in depreciation and amortisation on an adjusted basis. 

The Group incurred a tax charge in the year of £247 million (2022: £262 million). The effective tax rate was 20.7% (2022: 21.1%), while the adjusted 
effective tax rate was 23.2% (2022: 21.0%), with the increase from last year principally reflecting the impact of a higher UK corporate tax rate from  
1 April 2023. We currently anticipate an adjusted tax rate of 24%-25% in 2024.

Adjusted profits attributable to non-controlling interests, mainly in Tradeweb and LCH, totalled £292 million for the year ended 2023, an increase of 
13.2% from 2022 reflecting the strong performance of these businesses.

Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 138.9 pence (2022: 141.8 pence) with the decrease from last year mainly reflecting the 
lower profit before tax.

Adjusted basic earnings per share (AEPS) from continuing operations was 323.9 pence (2022: 317.8 pence). The 1.9% increase in AEPS year-on-year 
was driven by growth in underlying profitability partly offset by the higher depreciation and net finance expenses and an increased tax rate.

Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 79.3 pence per share, which together with the interim dividend of 35.7 pence per share paid to 
shareholders in September 2023, results in a 7.5% increase in the total dividend to 115 pence per share. The final dividend of 79.3 pence per  
share will be paid on 22 May 2024 to all shareholders on the share register at the record date of 19 April 2024. 

1  The interest differential is the difference in interest rates between the two currencies embedded in an FX derivative for the tenor of the derivative.

To better align with internal reporting, some small revenue items have been reallocated between business lines across 2022 from Real-Time Data and Data & Workflow into Benchmark Rates, 
Indices & Analytics.

Data & Analytics provides high value data, analytics, indices, workflow solutions and data management capabilities. Total revenue excluding 
recoveries of £5,267 million grew by 7.3%, driven by broad based strength across business lines and a 0.6% in-year contribution from acquisitions. 

Trading & Banking revenue of £1,656 million increased by 3.3%. Adjusting for the NEST disposal in 2023 and the benefit of last year’s TORA 
acquisition, organic growth was 2.5%. This performance was primarily driven by better price realisation following improvements to our product 
offering (e.g. Workspace) and customer service. 

Enterprise Data revenue of £1,411 million grew by 9.3%, reflecting the continued enhancement and expansion of our content, particularly in the fixed 
income space with the addition of Yieldbook, Tradeweb and debt corporate actions, and investment in capabilities such as MayStreet’s low latency 
data feeds and our cloud-based Real-Time Optimised solution. Building on the natural linkages with FTSE Russell and other parts of the Group is 
driving strong revenue synergy realisation.

Investment Solutions revenue of £1,423 million was up 7.9%. Subscription revenue growth continued the acceleration seen over recent years, with 
Benchmark Rates, Indices & Analytics growing 11.5%. Improvements to our sales process are achieving greater focus on customers and discipline  
in how we meet strong demand for our core benchmark products. Asset-based revenues accelerated over the course of the year, reflecting strong 
product inflows and a recovery in market levels. ETF AUM ended the year at an all-time high of $1.25 trillion, 23.4% higher than 31 December 2022. 

Wealth contributed £285 million of revenue in 2023, with Digital Solutions the main driver of the 4.4% growth on the prior year.

Customer & Third-Party Risk revenues of £492 million grew 16.4%. The World-Check screening business continued to deliver double-digit growth 
as regulatory and risk-driven customer demand for Anti Money-Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) solutions was complemented by 
further expansion of World-Check’s offering. Customer & Third-Party Risk Solutions also saw a small benefit from a full year contribution of last year’s 
acquisition of the GDC identity verification data business.

Organic Annual Subscription Value growth (“ASV”) at December 2023 was 6.7%, reflecting continued strong demand for our services, the 2023 price 
increase, ongoing improvements in retention and some loss of Credit Suisse business, as anticipated.

Cost of sales of £913 million reflects the cost of purchased content and royalties, including news, specialist data and exchange data, which are 
required for the Data & Analytics products. Growth at 4.7% was below that of revenues.

Adjusted operating expenses before depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to £2,348 million. Careful management of staff costs and 
ongoing delivery of synergies related to the Refinitiv acquisition meant cost growth of 5.7% was below that of revenues despite investment in the 
Microsoft partnership and other growth initiatives and the annualisation of expenses from businesses acquired in 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA of £2,376 million was up 9.2% on a constant currency basis, outpacing revenue growth. On an actual rates basis, adjusted EBITDA 
margin decreased 20 basis points to 45.1%. Adjusted operating profit was up 9.3%.

Capital Markets provides businesses with access to capital through issuance, and offers secondary market trading for equities, fixed income, interest 
rate derivatives, foreign exchange (FX) and other asset classes. 

Total revenue of £1,546 million grew 6.1% with the increase primarily driven by Fixed Income, Derivatives & Other.

Equities revenue of £227 million declined 8.8% as subdued market volatility fed through to lower Secondary Markets activity.

FX revenue of £251 million was down 1.9%. Weaker interbank FX activity, particularly in H2 2023, adversely impacted volumes on our dealer-focused 
Matching platform. Our dealer-to-client platform, FXall, also saw lower activity from buyside participants.

Fixed Income, Derivatives & Other revenues are primarily driven by Tradeweb, a global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, 
equities and money markets. Revenues of £1,068 million were 12.1% higher, accelerating over the year as risk appetite returned to markets. 
Tradeweb’s solutions are supporting the ongoing electronification of trading and the group continues to make share gains in key product lines. 
Tradeweb made further progress in international markets, complementing its strong organic expansion with the acquisition of Yieldbroker, which 
added customers and liquidity in Australian and New Zealand government bonds. Tradeweb also announced the acquisition of algorithmic execution 
technology business r8fin, which completed in January 2024.

Cost of sales grew more slowly than revenues, increasing 3.2% to £35 million. These costs primarily reflect expenses within the Tradeweb business 
relating to data feeds.

Adjusted operating expenses before depreciation, amortisation and impairment of £715 million were up 8.2%, again driven by the strong revenue 
growth and investment at Tradeweb.

Adjusted EBITDA rose to £796 million, growing 4.4% as a result of the topline growth at Tradeweb while adjusted EBITDA margin was slightly lower 
at 51.5% (2022: 52.1%). Adjusted operating profit grew more modestly, up 1.5%. This reflects a higher adjusted depreciation and amortisation expense 
following sustained investment in our offering, in particular the introduction of the non-deliverable forward (NDF) Matching platform in 2023, and the 
move to more agile capex releases.

Post Trade provides clearing, risk management, capital optimisation and regulatory reporting solutions. Total revenue of £878 million grew 19.0%, 
and 11.1% on an organic basis. Total income, including Net Treasury Income, was £1,167 million, up 17.4% year-on-year. 

OTC Derivatives revenue increased to £517 million, up 28.9%, partly reflecting the in-year benefit of the Quantile and Acadia acquisitions. Organic 
growth of 13.9% was also strong, with uncertainty around the timing and scale of Central Bank interest rate moves driving increased client clearing 
activity in SwapClear. We also generated £18 million of one-time revenues helping customers renew contracts in response to US reference rate 
reform. 

Securities & Reporting revenue of £254 million grew 7.0% as payments received relating to the early termination of the Euronext clearing agreement 
more than offset the in-year impact of lost cash equity clearing revenues and subdued equity market volumes. We expect some additional revenue 
and Net Treasury Income attrition in 2024 as Euronext transition their remaining clearing activities. RepoClear continued to see good growth. 

Non-Cash Collateral revenue of £107 million grew 7.5% as customers worked to optimise their collateral and clearing volumes grew.

Net Treasury Income (NTI) of £289 million increased 12.8% as interest margins benefited from money market trends. Higher levels of cash collateral 
year-on-year were also supportive in the first half, but moderated in the second half as balances normalised.

Cost of sales of £195 million (2022: £150 million) include £10 million of additional expense from Acadia. The remaining organic increase was driven 
mainly by revenue share arrangements relating to the SwapClear business.

Adjusted operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to £403 million, up 20.6%. Additional costs relating to 
Acadia and Quantile (both high-growth but not fully scaled businesses) drove much of the increase, though organic expenses also grew to reflect 
higher volumes and investment in new capabilities. As a result, adjusted EBITDA of £569 million grew 12.3%, while adjusted EBITDA margin declined 
to 48.8% (2022: 52.2%). Adjusted operating profit of £446 million was up 13.0%.

In July, LSEG completed the acquisition of the 11.1% minority interest in LCH SA for a total cash consideration of €111 million. In February 2024  
LSEG acquired 3.24% of the share capital in LCH Group Holdings Limited from certain minority shareholders, taking LSEG’s ownership of LCH Group 
Holdings Limited to 85.85%.

The Group’s business continued to be strongly cash generative during the year, with operating cash flow of £3,223 million (2022: £3,193 million). 
Cash outflows for purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles amounted to £1,031 million (2022: £926 million), which includes  
our business-as-usual investment programmes as well as investments related to the Refinitiv integration.

Equity free cash flow was £1,793 million (2022: £1,664 million), representing 100% conversion of profits attributable to LSEG shareholders. During the 
year the Group deployed £618 million on acquisitions, largely in respect of Acadia, Tradeweb’s acquisition of Yieldbroker and the acquisition of the 
LCH SA minority interest. Dividends paid during the year were £611 million, with the increase from last year reflecting the continued strong growth in 
dividends per share. £1,235 million was spent on share buybacks, of which £450 million related to the LSEG share buyback programme announced 
in August 2022, £750 million was in respect of the directed buyback programme announced in March 2023, and a small component related to 
Tradeweb’s share repurchase and other associated fees.

Cash generation, after organic and inorganic investments and other normal course payment obligations, was positive, contributing to cash and  
cash equivalents growing from £3,209 million as at 31 December 2022 to £3,580 million as at 31 December 2023.

At 31 December 2023, the Group had operating net debt of £6,808 million (31 December 2022: £6,226 million) after setting aside £1,348 million for 
regulatory and operational amounts. The increase was driven by the Acadia acquisition, shareholder returns including the £450 million on-market 
buyback and the £750 million directed buyback and an increase in the amount of cash held for regulatory and operational purposes. 

At 31 December 2023 group leverage1 was 1.8x, unchanged from the previous year (2022: 1.8x). During the course of 2023 the Group moved its 
target leverage range to 1.5-2.5x (previously 1.0-2.0x), with an intention to maintain day-to-day leverage around the middle of this range. 

The Group has access to committed revolving credit facilities of £3.0 billion, consisting of a £1,925 million facility and a £1,075 million facility,  
both maturing in December 2027. No drawings were outstanding under either facility at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: £nil). 

In September 2023, LSEG successfully returned to the debt capital markets, issuing €1.4 billion of 3-year and 7-year bonds, with proceeds used to 
repay the remaining US dollar term loan entered into as part of the Refinitiv acquisition in 2021. The net effect was to extend the average maturity  
of our financing. 

LSEG is rated A with stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A3 with stable outlook by Moody’s. LCH Limited and LCH SA are rated AA- with stable 
outlook by S&P.

Sustainability strategy
In this section we summarise our sustainability strategy and how we 
address material sustainability risks and opportunities, with further detail 
in the 2023 Sustainability Report and Sustainability Databook. 

Our approach to sustainability is guided by LSEG’s purpose to drive 
financial stability, empower economies and enable customers to create 
sustainable growth. This shapes everything we do and helps us to 
deliver long-term value for our stakeholders. One of LSEG’s Group 
Strategic Objectives (GSO) is to establish LSEG as a strategic enabler 
and leader of sustainable economic growth. This strategic objective is 
embedded in the business as each division and function is required  
to set an aligned divisional objective in support of the GSO, with KPIs 
attached. Further information about our GSOs can be found on pages 
139 to 141.

Sustainability themes 
Our sustainability strategy is framed by three broad themes that are 
shaping financial markets, and where we seek to amplify our impact. 
Within each theme we have set objectives which are delivered via  
our products and services, market engagement and policy advocacy, 
and our operations. The themes are: 

Climate transition
Decarbonising the global economy is critical to minimising adverse 
social and environmental impacts associated with climate change.  
This requires significant resources to be directed towards the transition 
globally while ensuring that the costs and benefits of this are shared 
fairly within and between countries. LSEG supports a just transition 
through its market engagement and policy advocacy, alongside  
a range of sustainable finance and investment solutions.

Growth of the green economy
Alongside decarbonising the economy, it is important that we create, 
scale and deliver solutions to critical sustainability challenges. LSEG 
enables sustainable economic activity in the capital markets through  
its financial markets infrastructure, data and market engagement. 

Inclusive economic opportunity
An inclusive economy enables people to participate in, and benefit  
from, economic growth, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, 
social background, disability, or any other personal characteristic.  
LSEG creates an inclusive culture internally and supports economic 
empowerment programmes in communities. 

Key sustainability topics 
To help us prioritise sustainability topics we commissioned an 
independent materiality assessment in 2021. This sought views from  
key stakeholder groups including customers, colleagues, suppliers and 
investors. It also included a wider review of the regulatory landscape 
applicable to LSEG. Further detail about the assessment can be  
found on page 8 of our 2021 Sustainability Report alongside a full  
list of sustainability issues. The four sustainability issues of greatest 
importance are: sustainable finance, climate risk management, talent 
attraction and retention, and information security and data privacy. 
These issues have the potential to affect our execution of business 
strategy, revenues, operating costs, business continuity and reputation. 
We are conducting a double sustainability materiality assessment which 
will be finalised in 2024, considering the impact of LSEG on society and 
the environment, as well as the risks and opportunities to our business 
from sustainability. We will share the results of this in future reports. 

More information on our key sustainability topics can be found on 
page 5 of our 2023 Sustainability Report.

Governance and oversight 
The LSEG Board approves the Group’s sustainability strategy, including 
the climate transition plan and sustainability reporting, and holds 
executive management to account for its delivery. Sustainability is on  
the Board agenda at least twice a year. The Audit Committee oversees 
applicable sustainability-related reporting requirements, and the Board 
Risk Committee oversees and advises the Board on the current risk 
exposures and profile of the Group including sustainability risks, 
emerging risks and future risk strategy and risk culture.

The Executive Committee is responsible for setting the Group’s 
sustainability ambition, agreeing the strategy, monitoring progress  
and approving sustainability reporting. 

The Executive Risk Committee is an Executive Committee sub-
committee responsible for the consideration and oversight of risk 
matters, including those which relate to sustainability. The Committee 
focused on risk culture, risk profile oversight, risk policy oversight,  
risk appetite and risk disclosure and reporting.

The Sustainability Committee is an Executive Committee subcommittee 
responsible for providing direction and oversight of the Group’s overall 
sustainability strategy and programmes, including LSEG’s Climate 
Transition Plan. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer.  
The Committee meets at least four times a year and reports to the 
Executive Committee at least twice a year. Several working groups 
interact with the Committee, including the Sustainability Working  
Group, the Climate Transition Steering Group and the Sustainable 
Finance and Investment Business Forum.

The Chief People Officer is a member of the Executive Committee and  
is accountable for all aspects of our People strategy, including talent 
attraction, reward, compensation and benefits, training, development, 
equity, diversity and inclusion, colleague wellbeing, employment 
regulation and worker rights including collective bargaining.

Skills and competence 
It is important that those involved in overseeing and delivering  
LSEG’s sustainability strategy have appropriate skills and competencies.  
With respect to the Board, in 2023, new sustainability learning resources 
were made available to enable them to develop their knowledge.  
This included the LSEG Sustainability Campus which is an online 
resource with two core learning pathways and which is available to  
all colleagues. For colleagues who need to develop a deeper level of 
knowledge, we have also introduced an online sustainability learning 
portal, Sustainability Unlocked. This is managed by a third party and has 
tailored learning pathways. We have identified 2,000 colleagues who 
will have access to this training. 

Sustainability risk management 
Sustainability is a Strategic Risk in the Group Risk Taxonomy and is 
embedded in the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF). The 
Sustainability Risk Framework builds on the ERMF and provides further 
detail on the required control environment for sustainability-related risk 
which specifically defines roles and responsibilities to deliver expected 
outcomes in relation to sustainability risks. The dedicated Sustainability 
Risk team is responsible for developing a Group-wide view of the 
management and status of sustainability risks and provides second line 
support to the business to review and challenge its sustainability risk 
profile. The Sustainability Risk Team reports to the Non-Financial Risk 
Committee (NFRC) when specific issues arise, and to the Board Risk 
Committee no less than annually and as needed.

LSEG’s Internal Audit team incorporates sustainability into its audit 
schedule, by looking at sustainability as an embedded part of other 
audits, or auditing specific sustainability programmes, or sustainable 
finance and investment products and services.

People

People drive our performance and 
productivity. Our inclusive culture and values 
set us apart, leading the way to meeting the 
needs of our customers and stakeholders, 
advancing technology and creating  
a workforce that is future ready. With more 
than 25,000 people in over 60 countries,  
we work with ambition and accountability.

Culture and values
Our purpose is the foundation on which our culture is built. Our values 
underpin our purpose and set the standard for everything we do, every 
day. They go to the heart of who we are and guide our decision-making 
and everyday actions. Culture is one of LSEG’s GSOs which is focused 
on fostering diversity, inclusion and a sense of belonging at LSEG, 
alongside building and developing capability to deliver our goals.  
During the year we launched LSEG’s new values, co-created with our 
colleagues following extensive engagement and feedback from surveys, 
virtual and in-person focus groups, feedback from customers, online 
sentiment and interviews with media partners. Our values are being 
embedded into our people processes and procedures including 
recognition, recruitment and performance assessments. Further 
information about our Sustainability Governance, including our People 
strategy, can be found on page 24 of our 2023 Sustainability Report.

LSEG’s values 

Integrity

We stand by our principles and deliver on our promises.  
We earn trust by acting responsibly.

Partnership Our open model is integral to how we do business. We forge 

long-term relationships; we work together to solve evolving 
needs and deliver strategic outcomes.

Excellence

Change

Our breadth of capabilities sets us apart, globally. We achieve 
industry-leading outcomes by combining unique, diverse 
perspectives and knowledge across markets.

We embrace change. We combine human ingenuity, 
technology, risk management and insight to create the 
products and services that lead and shape the industry.

Colleague engagement 
We saw increased participation in this year’s Group-wide colleague 
engagement survey, LSEG Engage, with 88% of colleagues responding 
(2022: 86%). The results showed engagement at the same levels seen  
in 2022 with a score of 75, against an external environment which saw 
declining levels of overall engagement (source: Microsoft Viva Glint 2023). 
The engagement score is a combined measure of responses to questions 
on colleague satisfaction and likelihood to recommend LSEG as a place 
to work. Results from the survey showed colleagues increasingly 
understand LSEG’s strategy, saw improvement in opportunities to learn 
and develop, and in the support they received from their people leaders. 
The survey found that continued focus is needed around addressing 
barriers to execution, representing an opportunity to make sure our 
people are better enabled to deliver at their best. 

Other forms of colleague engagement, such as Global and Divisional 
townhall meetings, conversations with the Board and Executive 
Committee Exchanges continue to have strong colleague interaction. The 
latter involve members of the Executive Committee holding round table 
discussions with small groups of colleagues, providing an opportunity for 
listening, feedback and discussion. Twelve of these were held in 2023.

Learning and development 
To ensure LSEG has the necessary skills and capabilities to execute its 
business strategy and help colleagues define and achieve their career 
ambitions, the My Career programme was launched. This programme is 
founded on a skills-based career framework accessible through LSEG’s 
Career Navigator talent-marketplace software, which connects individual 
personal ambitions with roles across LSEG and helps colleagues build 
associated development plans.

Aggregated level skill data from Career Navigator is informing the talent 
strategy for 2024, identifying skill gaps in key areas such as product 
development and management skills. In 2023, 36% of vacancies  
(2,700 vacancies) were filled internally in part due to a number of 
strategic programmes building skills and capabilities. We continue to 
look for ways to drive internal mobility and expect this to rise over the

medium to longer term. Voluntary colleague turnover continued  
to stay low (less than 10%) in 2023, in line with external market trends,  
a significant decrease versus prior year. 

Alongside these goals, we continue to focus on increasing diversity 
among the wider leadership group (Group Director and Director 
Leaders), to build a more diverse pipeline of future senior leaders.

Equity, diversity and inclusion
We continued our focus on creating an inclusive culture during the  
year. We introduced inclusive hiring training for all people leaders and 
ran a data disclosure campaign to increase self-reported colleague 
diversity data which increased our average data disclosure rate across 
categories such as ethnicity, gender, disability and sexual orientation 
from 42% to 69%.

In 2023, we made good progress relative to our diversity goals for 
gender, however there is room to improve in relation to our goals for 
underrepresented ethnic and racial groups. By the end of 2023, we 
exceeded our goal for women in our leadership community, achieving 
42% against a minimum goal of 40%. With respect to underrepresented 
ethnic and racial groups, we did not achieve our goal to reach 20% 
representation within the leadership community by the end of 2023, 
closing the year at 14% (2022: 15%). However, we remain firmly focused 
on closing this gap, building an inclusive environment for our diverse 
talent through the leadership development programmes we launched  
in 2022, including Illuminate – targeted towards black and Latinx 
colleagues – and the APAC Accelerator for those based in Asia-Pacific 
region. For more information on the measures we are taking, refer to 
page 26 of our 2023 Sustainability Report.

In 2023, we developed an enhanced methodology to help us  
review our EDI goals to ensure they remain relevant and can be 
appropriately measured globally. We have therefore updated our 
gender and ethnicity diversity goals for our senior leadership  
community for 2024 and beyond:
 — Gender: maintain at least 40% of women in senior leadership  

(ExCo and Group Leaders) going forward 

 — Ethnicity: 25% underrepresented ethnic groups in senior leadership 

roles (ExCo and Group Leaders) by 2027

Pay equity 
LSEG is committed to building an equitable and inclusive environment 
for all, including pay structures that are free of bias. We are committed  
to pay equity which means ensuring that no discrepancies in pay result 
from differences in personal characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, 
age or nationality. Our pay and performance policies are globally 
adopted and regularly reviewed by LSEG’s Executive Committee and 
Remuneration Committee, with the aim of ensuring market alignment 
and compliance.

The review used data as of 5 April 2023 and quantified the Identifiable 
Pay Gap, which shows the gap in pay between two groups that can  
be attributed to explainable and objective factors (such as seniority,  
job role, location, business sector, experience and performance) and  
the Non-Identifiable Pay Gap which shows the remaining gap once 
these factors have been accounted for.

The 2023 results found that we made progress on the previous year. 
With respect to gender, we saw a raw pay gap of 29.2%, down from 
32.6% in 2022, with a non-identifiable pay gap of 1.2% (down from 1.5% 
in 2022), in favour of males. With respect to ethnicity (UK and US only) 
we saw a raw pay gap of 13.4% (down from 17.8% in 2022), in favour of 
white employees, with a non-identifiable pay gap of 0.8% (up from  
0.3% in 2022), in favour of racial and ethnic underrepresented groups.  
Further detail can be found in our 2023 Sustainability Report and the 
Sustainability Databook. 

Health and wellbeing 
We take a holistic approach to wellbeing, with a wide range of  
resources available to support colleagues’ emotional, physical,  
financial and social wellbeing. This includes the Employee Assistance 
Programme and a community of 170 Mental Health Champions.

Community 

The LSEG Foundation is the main channel for our community investment 
and engagement and is an independent charity partner registered with 
the Charities Commission for England and Wales. The LSEG Foundation 
Board is overseen by a Trustee Board, chaired by the LSEG Chief 
People Officer, five employee trustees and two independent trustees.

The Foundation provides grants to charity partners and non-profit 
groups that focus on economic empowerment, sustainable economy, 
and disaster relief. During 2023 the LSEG Foundation gave almost  
£4 million in grants to 103 charity partners. Charity partners were also 
supported through employee volunteering with 4,933 colleagues using 
their paid time off for volunteering. Funding for humanitarian relief 
caused by conflict or natural disasters was granted to support those 
impacted by earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, floods in Libya, and the 
conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Palestine. 

The LSEG Foundation supports 
economic empowerment 
programmes in the communities we

transition to a sustainable economy 
through key strategic partnerships.

This year we introduced new leave entitlements, in line with our values 
and ambition to become one of the greatest places to work. These 
include paid bereavement leave, ten days’ fully paid carer’s leave and 
six weeks’ paid transitioning leave for those who need time as part  
of a gender transitioning journey. We have also introduced policies to 
support colleagues affected by HIV/AIDS and Menopause Guidance, 
which includes a range of information and resources, supported by 
trained menopause champions. 

We support our people through crises and challenges due to global 
conflict, prioritising their wellbeing and safety. We work with their  
People Leaders to make sure anyone impacted has the immediate  
and long-term support they need as the situation evolves. 

Business conduct

All colleagues are required to complete mandatory training on our  
Code of Conduct to ensure high standards of business conduct are 
maintained. In 2023, 99.8% of colleagues completed the training. 

The Group has zero tolerance for financial crime as it undermines the 
rule of law, democratic processes, and the wellbeing and human rights 
of citizens. It also distorts free trade and competition. Our Financial 
Crime Policy sets out requirements to minimise financial crime, which 
encompasses, but may not be limited to, money laundering, terrorist 
financing, breach of international trade sanctions, bribery and corruption, 
fraud and false accounting, insider trading, market abuse, theft or misuse 
of confidential information or other malpractice. This is supported by 
mandatory training for all colleagues. 

Human rights 
We are committed to respecting and preserving the human rights of  
all colleagues, contractors and those in our supply chain. Our Human 
Rights Policy commits us to: the freedom of association and the effective 
recognition of collective bargaining; eliminating all forms of forced and 
compulsory labour and the abolition of child labour; and eliminating 
discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 

We regard all forms of modern slavery and human trafficking as a crime 
and a violation of fundamental human rights. While LSEG operates in  
a sector where the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking in the 
workforce is inherently low, we are committed to implementing and 
promoting practices which combat modern slavery in all its forms.  
As a UK headquartered business, we are committed to adhering or 
complying with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and our Modern 
Slavery Act Statement can be found on lseg.com.

Whistleblowing 
Colleagues, contractors and suppliers can raise concerns about 
adherence to our Code of Conduct, relevant laws and regulations or 
conduct which is potentially unethical or harmful. LSEG’s Speak Up 
Policy sets out how concerns can be raised confidentially while  
offering individuals protection from retaliation such as demotion  
or the withholding of promotion, reduction of wages, discrimination, 
victimisation, harassment or unjustifiable disciplinary proceedings.

Reports can be made confidentially, and anonymously if preferred, via the 
24-hour Speak Up hotline (phone and online) which is independent from 
LSEG or with the Legal & Compliance or Risk functions. All whistleblowing 
reports are reviewed by a Speak Up triage team and reported to the Audit 
Committee. Between 1 January and 31 October 2023 there were 136 reports 
made1. All reports are investigated fully and action taken as appropriate.

1  FY2023 Speak-up data is for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 October 2023. FY2022 data  
is for the period 1 April 2022 to 31 December 2022 because in April 2022 LSEG’s new 
“Speak Up” programme came into effect. Moving forward this data will be reported from  
31 October every year for a 12-month period to align with external audit process.

Climate 

This section sets out LSEG’s approach to climate change, including the 
related risks, opportunities and impacts. Here, we also set out targets in 
relation to our operational emissions and we discuss the progress we 
are making towards setting targets for our products and services, and 
with respect to our engagement with stakeholders and policy-makers. 
This section responds to disclosure requirements under Listing Rule 
9.8.6 R (8) for reporting in line with the Taskforce for Climate-related 
Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and the Companies (Strategic Report) 
(Climate-related Financial Disclosure) Regulations 2022. Summary level 
information is presented in this section, while further detail can be  
found in the 2023 Sustainability Report.

Risks, opportunities and impacts
Climate change presents both risks and opportunities, which impact 
LSEG in a number of ways over different timeframes: 

Short-term

Medium-term

Long-term

0–3 years

3–10 years

10–30 years

The actual or potential impact on LSEG of these risks and opportunities 
vary in magnitude. When identifying and assessing climate-related risks 
or opportunities we define the “substantive financial or strategic impact” 
according to the magnitude of the financial cost or reputational impact 
on the Group, as well as the likelihood that the risk will occur. These 
risks and opportunities are likely to impact business strategy and 
operations, our product portfolio, client target and/or resource mix.  
We quantify the minimum threshold necessary to evaluate a potentially 
substantive financial or strategic impact as a climate-related disruption 
to the Group resulting in an impact greater than £10 million. Alongside 
this, we consider emerging risks, which are newly developing risks that 
cannot yet be fully assessed but that could, in the future, affect the 
viability of the Group or a Division over a longer-term time horizon. 

Transition-related risks and opportunities arise from the transition to  
a low carbon economy; while not an exhaustive list, examples of some  
of those relevant to LSEG are as follows: 
 — Policy and legal: introduction of regulation, such as that related  
to disclosure, impacts LSEG as we are required to comply with 
international and national reporting requirements, or those associated 
with climate-related products and services. These introduce new 
Director duties, increase operational and compliance costs, and 
impact the management of our climate-related risks and opportunities. 
These regulatory changes also affect our customers which in turn 
creates an opportunity for LSEG to support them with appropriate 
market data and infrastructure. 

 — Technology: we rely on technology to deliver our products and 

services to customers, including data management in data centres. 
Changes to technology, energy prices or carbon costs could 
potentially impact LSEG’s operations.

 — Market: as we transition towards a net zero economy our customers’ 
needs are changing. There is growing demand for sustainability-
related market data and infrastructure that help investors, corporates 
and financial institutions inform decision-making around strategy, 
capital raising and allocation and investment. LSEG provides a large 
and growing range of sustainable financial investment products and 
services to its customers. 

We have conducted analysis of transition risk specifically looking at the 
potential costs of carbon under three recognised climate scenarios  
from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). This work 
underscored the importance of pursing our emission reduction targets, 
as failure to meet these could lead to significant annual costs if we 
become subject to carbon pricing in the future as defined by these 
scenarios. Further detail about the analysis can be found in the 2023 
Sustainability Report, on pages 16 to 17.

Physical risks arise from changing weather patterns associated with 
climate change and can affect LSEG as follows: 
 — Acute physical risks: the notable increase in the frequency and 

severity of extreme weather events, such as floods, windstorm and 
drought, are relevant to LSEG’s international property portfolio. 
Extreme weather events could adversely impact our properties, data 
centres, our employees or surrounding infrastructure, which could 
cause business interruption. Given recent incidences of flooding in 
India and Sri Lanka which impacted LSEG over the course of 2022, 
we continue to carry out extensive reviews, including the initiation  
of a detailed environmental assessment of our property locations.
 — Chronic physical risks: increasing global average temperatures could 

negatively impact LSEG. Some parts of our international property 
portfolio are at greater risk of extreme temperatures which in turn 
could require greater cooling to ensure business continuity, which 
adds to operational costs. 

We have conducted an analysis of physical risks to LSEG by using 
recognised climate scenarios set out by the Intergovernmental  
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). LSEG locations at greater risk from 
chronic climate risks include Southeast Asia and the Middle East.  
Further information about this analysis can be found in the 2023 
Sustainability Report, on pages 18 to 19.

We recognise the opportunity to fulfil customers’ changing needs as 
demand for sustainable finance and investment products and services 
grow. As a leading provider of financial market data and infrastructure 
LSEG can provide products and services which help to support the 
transition to a low carbon economy. Our offerings span data, analytics, 
indices, capital raising and corporate services. For over 20 years  
we have been playing a leading role in sustainable finance, bringing 
together expertise, powered by transparent and robust data for our 
customer and market participants. Further information about our 
products and services can be found in the 2023 Sustainability Report 
pages 9 to 11.

Climate Transition Plan 
We published our first Climate Transition Plan in 2022 which sets  
out how we are aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement1 in  
our operations, market engagement and our products and services.  
We have set targets to address our operational emissions and 
engagement with our supply chain, and we’re in the process of setting 
targets related to our market engagement, products and services, 
through our membership of the Net Zero Financial Service Provider 
Alliance (NZFSPA). 

1  Through the 2015 Paris Agreement, world governments committed to limiting global 

temperature rise to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit 
warming to 1.5°C. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned  
that global warming must not exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures to avoid the 
catastrophic impacts of climate change. To achieve this, GHG emissions must halve by  
2030 – and drop to net zero by 2050.

Sustainability continued

Our targets to reduce our operational emissions and engage suppliers 
are approved by the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi). While we 
have an ambition to reach net zero1 by 2040 we have not set a formal, 
SBTi approved target in this respect to date as we have been prioritising 
work to achieve our 2030 targets. In future we will review whether, and 
if so when, we will formalise our net zero ambition into  
an SBTi approved target. 

Our targets: 
 — Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030  

from a 2019 base year. 

 — Reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel and energy 
related activities (FERA), business travel, home working and  
employee commuting by 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. 
 — 67% of Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services 

covered by science-based targets by 2026. 

An important part of our climate transition plan is our range of products 
and services which help our customers achieve their climate goals. 
LSEG is a founding member of the NZFSPA, which comprises a group of 
financial service providers who are committed to aligning their business 
with net zero and integrating this into relevant products and services 
offered to capital market participants. Subject to legal, regulatory and 
professional standards, Alliance members commit to align relevant 
products and services to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner, scaling 
and mainstreaming Paris-alignment into the core of the business.  
The commitment also incorporates capability building, stakeholder 
engagement and operational impacts. The Alliance works through 
several sub-groups and given its diverse business model, LSEG is 
involved in three of these, including exchanges, data providers and 
indices. Each sub-group has defined a target-setting framework which  
is in the process of being approved by the UN Race to Zero, after  
which Alliance members will set and publish their firm-level targets.  
We will share these in future reports when available. 

Progress against our targets 
We publish comprehensive data regarding our GHG emissions in our 
Sustainability Databook which is a companion document to the 2023 
Sustainability Report. In line with The Companies (Directors’ Report) and 
Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 
2018, we also publish our Streamlined Energy and Carbon Report (SECR) 
table on page 68. 

In 2023, our Group carbon footprint increased by 13% relative to 2022. 
This is principally due to increased levels of office occupancy and 
business travel, as well as an increase in spend on goods and services, 
returning to more normal levels following the global pandemic. There 
has also been a material increase to UK DEFRA emission factors which 
are used to calculate air travel emissions which has driven a significant 
in-year increase. 

Despite the increase in 2023 emissions relative to 2022, we remain well 
on track to meet the 2030 targets that we set out above. With respect  
to our target on Scope 1 and 2 (market) emissions we closed the year 
having reduced 90%, against our 2019 baseline. With respect to our 
target on Scope 3 emissions from business travel, home working and 
employee commuting, we closed the year having reduced 13% against 
our 2019 baseline. When including FERA, this meant that by the end of 
2023, we had reduced our carbon emissions addressed by our Climate 
Transition Plan by -29% from a 2019 baseline. Scope 3 emissions from 
purchased goods and services account for over 90% of our total carbon 
footprint. In order to reduce these emissions, we are focused on 
engaging with our supply chain. Our target is to ensure that suppliers 
responsible for at least 67% of our Scope 3 (purchased goods and 
services) emissions have adopted their own science-based emission 
reduction targets by end 2026. We are on target to achieve this,  
closing the year at 44%.

TCFD/CFD Statement of Compliance 
We have been a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations since 2017. LSEG plc  
has complied with the requirements of 9.8.6 R (8) by including climate-
related financial disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations. 
The climate-related financial disclosures made by LSEG plc comply  
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as amended  
by the Companies (Strategic Report) (Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure) Regulations 2022 (CFD). Please see the TCFD summary 
table for an overview of our approach, and further detail in the  
2023 Sustainability Report. 

Further detail about our Climate Transition Plan, including progress 
against targets, can be found in our 2023 Sustainability Report and 
comprehensive climate data is in our Sustainability Databook. We have 
adopted this approach due to the comprehensive and technical content 
of the climate-related financial disclosures and are better able to 
provide comprehensive and decision-useful reporting in our 2023 
Sustainability Report. 

We are monitoring the development of reporting standards and 
requirements including the International Sustainability Standards Board 
(ISSB), The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) and 
the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and will align 
with these in a timely manner. Further detail on how LSEG intends to be 
an early adopter of the TNFD can be found on page 22 of our 2023 
Sustainability Report.

1  Our working definition of net zero is that of the SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard V1.1 2023 

which states that a state of net zero emissions involves: (a) reducing scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions to zero or a residual level consistent with reaching net-zero emissions at the  
global or sector level in eligible 1.5°C scenarios or sector pathways and (b) neutralising any 
residual emissions at the net zero target date – and any GHG emissions released into the 
atmosphere thereafter.

The Board’s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities
The LSEG Board has ultimate oversight of the organisation’s sustainability strategy, including  
its management of climate-related risks and opportunities, ensuring the long-term success of  
the Company and that stakeholders’ expectations are understood and met. 

During 2023 sustainability was on the Board agenda twice. The Audit Committee is responsible 
for overseeing climate-related reporting, and held a deep dive on reporting regulation in 2023. 
The Board Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group approach on sustainability 
risks, including those arising from climate. The Board is responsible for holding executive 
management to account for the delivery of its sustainability strategy. 

Management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities
The Executive Committee is responsible for setting the Group’s sustainability ambition and 
strategy, monitoring progress and approving disclosures. The Sustainability Committee is 
responsible for providing direction and oversight of the Group’s overall sustainability strategy  
and programmes, including its Climate Transition Plan. The Sustainability Committee is chaired  
by the Chief Risk Officer and meets four times a year or more frequently as required. It reports  
to the Executive Committee and Board at least twice a year. 

Further detail can be found in our 2023 Sustainability Report on pages 7 and 15.

The climate-related risks and opportunities we have identified over the short,  
medium and long term 
Risks and opportunities arise from regulatory, technology and market changes as we transition  
to a low carbon economy as well as acute and chronic physical risks from a changing climate.  
We have evaluated actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities which 
helps us understand the resilience of our strategy, taking into consideration different climate-
related scenarios. In 2023, we updated analysis of physical risks associated with our property  
and datacentre portfolio. We also updated our assessment of transition risks under Network for 
Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios, including the financial quantification of risks. 
From a transitional perspective, carbon pricing could have a significant financial impact if our 
Climate Transition Plan is not effectively executed. From a physical risk perspective, a third of  
our locations are exposed to a high level of heat stress, predominantly located in Southeast  
Asia and the Middle East. When looking at longer-term exposure to 2050, drought and fire  
risks substantially increase in a 4°C world. 

The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our businesses,  
strategy and financial planning
In our analysis we used the predicted carbon price in each NGFS scenario in the short, medium 
and long-term to estimate the potential costs associated with LSEG’s three possible emission 
pathways, assuming we pay for all emissions in scope of the analysis. The results show that 
significant costs associated with carbon pricing could be avoided through the implementation  
of our planned decarbonisation pathway, reducing our emissions in line with our SBTi targets. 
Conversely, if LSEG fails to achieve its targets, significant cost would be associated with  
a business-as-usual scenario in a world that is trending towards net zero in 2050. 

Looking ahead, we remain fully committed to acting as a strategic enabler of sustainable 
economic growth, in line with our purpose statement (see page 26 of this report). Throughout 
2024, we will continue developing our product offering in SFI in areas such as ESG indices,  
the Green Economy Mark, and our Sustainable Bond Market. 

The resilience of our strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, 
including a 2°C or lower scenario
We have disclosed the assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities on the business, and 
how it pertains to our science-based targets and decarbonisation trajectory. We have quantified 
across short-, medium- and long-term time horizons the impact of transitional risk as assessed 
against NGFS carbon pricing scenarios, as well as our physical risk exposure. This assessment 
includes a 2°C or lower scenario under both physical and transitional analysis.

This analysis re-emphasises the need to continue to deliver on our Climate Transition Plan,  
as our decarbonisation initiatives will mitigate the impact of potential carbon pricing on the 
business. From a physical risk perspective, the output of our scenario analysis will feed into  
our location strategy, ensuring climate change is considered when thinking through longer-term 
strategic location plans. The physical risks we face are also mitigated by the fact that the majority 
of our locations are leased, and we have robust business interruption plans in place.

Further detail can be found in our 2023 Sustainability Report pages 15 to 19.

Risk 
management 

How we identify,  
assess and manage 
climate-related risks.

Our processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks
We identify climate-related risks as part of our Group Risk Taxonomy. Sustainability is a specific 
strategic risk which pulls out climate transition as an underlying risk. We use scenario analysis  
to identify and assess climate-related risks, using NGFS scenarios for transition risk and IPCC for 
physical risk. This analysis re-emphasises the need to continue to deliver on our climate transition 
plan, as our decarbonisation initiatives will mitigate the impact of potential carbon pricing on the 
business. From a physical risk perspective, the output of our scenario analysis will feed into our 
location strategy, ensuring the evolution in climate is considered when thinking through longer-
term strategic location plans. The physical risks we face are also mitigated by the fact that the 
majority of our locations are leased, and we have robust business interruption plans in place. 
Revenues are not location or site dependant to a large degree. 

Our processes for managing climate-related risks
Climate risks identified in the risk taxonomy are managed through the ERMF. Responsibility for 
management, mitigation and adaptation of climate-related risks rests with the business units and 
corporate functions. This process is supported by the Group Risk function and by the governance 
groups which provide oversight, independent assessment and, as appropriate, challenge back  
to the business. 

Risks and opportunities with a potential substantial impact will be raised and factored into 
business strategy and operations. Principal risks are those considered to have the highest 
potential financial or strategic impact and are defined based on magnitude of financial costs to  
the Group as well as reputational impact. In addition to ongoing assessment, climate risks are 
specifically assessed as part of climate risk modelling activities. 

How our processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks  
are integrated into overall risk management
The Group is subject to a variety of risks which may have an impact on our ability to deliver our 
strategic plan. These include sustainability-related risks which have been integrated into LSEG’s 
risk-management processes and procedures and are reflected in our risk taxonomy and ERMF. 
Sustainability is a specific strategic risk, manifesting in product risk strategy (the risk that the 
products we create do not meet customers’ needs and expectations), greenwashing, worsening 
ESG ratings and a failure to deliver on our climate transition targets. Sustainability risks are also 
embedded within a wide range of other existing strategic and non-strategic risks within our risk 
taxonomy, including Operational Resilience; People; Regulatory, Compliance, Legal and Corporate 
Disclosure; and Financial and Model Risks. 

Further information can be found in our 2023 Sustainability Report on page 38.

The metrics used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with our strategy  
and risk management process 
Metrics used to assess climate-related risks include our operational emissions footprint  
(tonnes of CO2e), number of suppliers with science-based targets, actual and potential cost of 
carbon and physical risk exposures (including total value insured and value at risk).

Metrics used to assess climate-related opportunities relate to our suite of sustainable finance  
and investment products and services. 

Further information and data relating to these metrics can be found in the KPIs section of this 
report on pages 20 to 23, in our 2023 Sustainability Report on pages 9 to 11, 20 to 21 and our 
Sustainability Databook on pages 4 to 6.

Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,  
and the related risks
We disclose our Scope 1, Scope 2 and some Scope 3 emissions which can be found in  
our Sustainability Databook on pages 4 to 6.

Further detail about progress against our emissions targets can be found in our 2023 
Sustainability Report on pages 20 to 21.

The targets used to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance  
against targets
With respect to our operational emissions, we have set science-based targets, aligned with the 
goal of the Paris Agreement, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as described 
on the preceding pages. These targets include our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and Scope 3 
emissions from fuel and energy related activities (FERA), business travel, home working and 
employee commuting. We also have a supplier engagement target which relates to Scope 3 
emissions from purchased goods and services. 

While decarbonisation is the primary focus to reduce our operational emissions we also recognise 
the need to take responsibility for the emissions we are generating from our day-to-day activities. 
We offset our Scope 1, 2 and 3 (FERA, business travel and employee commuting) by buying carbon 
credits which meet recognised quality standards. We have a work programme in place to monitor, 
manage and reduce our emissions covered by these targets. 

This programme is organised into four key glidepaths: Places, People, Travel and Procurement. 
We have summarised progress towards these targets in this report and further detail can be  
found in our 2023 Sustainability Report and the Sustainability Databook.

As members of the Net Zero Financial Service Provides Alliance we will set targets related to  
our products and services and disclose these in future reports. 

Further detail about progress against our emissions targets and use of carbon offsets can be 
found in our 2023 Sustainability Report pages 20 to 22.

Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) Requirement
LSEG calculates all available emissions sources required under The Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and 
Carbon Report) Regulations 2018, along with the addition of fugitive and process emissions and the extension of the scope to global emissions, 
rather than UK emissions only. LSEG calculates greenhouse gas emissions to cover all material sources of emissions for which the Group is 
responsible. The methodology used was that of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition, 
2015). Responsibility for emissions sources was determined using the operational control approach.

The following pages set out how the Board has engaged with,  
and sought to understand the views of, our key stakeholders:
Customers
Workforce
Policymakers, Regulators and Supervisors

Engagement with our stakeholders has been achieved through  
a combination of direct Board engagement and indirect engagement, 
for example via executive management. Our management team is 
constantly engaged with stakeholders. The content from these 
interactions is fed into our business planning processes and Board 
reports as routine practice. In addition, the Board recognises that the 
Company’s shareholders are a key stakeholder, and the views and 
interests of shareholders influence the decisions and actions taken  
by the Board.

The Board seeks to engage with shareholders throughout the year  
with more detail provided in the Corporate Governance Report  
on page 99. The Board will seek to continue its engagement with 
stakeholders throughout 2024. Further information on the activities  
of the Board can be found on page 100.

Board engagement  
with stakeholders 

The Board recognises the 
importance of engaging with 
the Group’s stakeholders 
throughout the year.

Meaningful engagement and 
two-way dialogue allows the 
Board to understand: the 
interests, needs and concerns 
of the stakeholders relevant to 
the Company’s success; how 
they influence the operation  
of the business model; the 
delivery of strategy and 
decision-making; and the 
actions that the Board and 
management need to take  
in response.

Read more about the activities  
of the Board in the Corporate 
Governance Report beginning  
on page 90.

Customers 

Our diversified global business is built on 
customer partnership, delivering value across 
the trading lifecycle in Data & Analytics,  
Capital Markets and Post Trade. 

We believe that aligning our strategy, services 
and products to the needs and interests of  
our customers is central to driving sustainable 
long-term value growth.

Customers we serve

45,000+

How the Board has engaged
The Board considers customer feedback in order to understand our 
customers’ views on the Group’s products and services as well as  
the ways that they would like us to improve our offering. Customer 
engagement meetings help senior management to understand 
customer views and build strategic relationships with them. 

During 2023, the Group CEO and other executives engaged with 
customers in a number of ways, including: an extensive global outreach 
programme to key customers; individual meetings with particular 
emphasis on product offerings, technology transformation and 
operational resilience; and attendance at various round tables and 
conferences, including the COP28 and the FTSE Russell World 
Investment Forum to meet asset owners and asset managers in person. 

In 2023, the Board met with a strategic customer, to hear first hand 
about how the Group could further support them across the entire 
financial markets value chain.

Many of our shareholders are also customers and so the Group 
regularly receives informal customer feedback through investor 
outreach programmes. The Board also received an update on the 
Group’s relationships with the major banks who are both customers  
and suppliers of finance to the Group.

Key matters for stakeholder group
Key matters for customers include product offering, product innovation, 
a focus on digitisation/transformation, managing and reducing costs,  
and system stability.

How this engagement influenced Board discussions  
and decision-making
Customer feedback is regularly communicated by the Group CEO,  
CFO and members of the Executive team to the Board and this is  
taken into account when decisions and actions are taken which could 
impact customers. A specific agenda item is also included at each  
Board meeting focusing on a particular customer relationship or  
issue relating to customers. 

A key area of focus for our customers is the development of new 
products and services. Following the announcement of the strategic 
partnership with Microsoft, the Board reviewed initial customer 
responses to the partnership including their insights on the proposed 
Workspace, analytics and cloud platform solutions. The Board discussed 
the launch of the Design Partner Programme which seeks to enhance 
the innovations generated by the Microsoft partnership by gathering 
and analysing data and insights from customers while validating product 
concepts to ensure the delivery of meaningful customer solutions.  
The close engagement with strategic customers established by the 
Design Partner Programme aims to place customer engagement at  
the centre of the product development process.

During the year, the Board also reviewed LSEG FX product offerings  
and partnership opportunities to ensure that products continue to solve 
client needs. The Board discussed FX product strategy and solutions  
to address issues identified by FX customers. For more information  
on FX, please see page 39.

The Board considered actions taken to strengthen a longstanding 
relationship with a key customer to better understand their needs.  
The outcomes of the engagement process resulted in the customer 
signing a long-term strategic partnership to deliver a range of 
capabilities across the full trade lifecycle. 

In 2023, the Board also considered the launch of a brand transformation 
programme in order to increase stakeholder awareness and clarity 
around the LSEG brand. A new brand architecture and advertising 
campaign was introduced aimed at educating existing and prospective 
customers about the Group’s brands and business areas. This is  
a multi-year project and the Board will continue to receive updates  
on the brand transformation programme, particularly customer insights 
and sentiment towards it. Further information can be found in our 
Strategic Report on page 29.

Workforce 

The Group’s workforce is over 25,000 people  
in over 60 countries. Our global exposure and 
customer base are one reason why our diverse 
workforce is fundamental to the success of the 
Group. Regular two-way dialogue with, and 
feedback from, employees at every level is 
sought to ensure that there is meaningful 
dialogue between the Board and our workforce.

How the Board has engaged
Engagement with our employees includes formal and informal meetings, 
an annual employee engagement survey and townhall meetings.

The Board seeks to engage with a wide cross section of employees to 
better understand their perspectives on the business. Board members 
engaged in person with employees during their visit to the Paris office  
in 2023. The Board met and received presentations from EMEA-based 
management on the Group’s operations in the region and also engaged 
more informally over lunches and dinners. 

Non-Executive Directors also continued their programme of 
engagement, meeting virtually with employee forums in key regional 
locations across the world. Colleagues who took part in these 
conversations were encouraged to canvas views from other employees 
to share with Board members; which provided Board members with  
an opportunity to gain insight into the culture and any concerns at 
different levels of the business. Directors provided feedback to  
the Board at the next Board meeting and the engagements were  
shared with the workforce via intranet articles and videos. These 
engagements included:
 — Don Robert, Tsega Gebreyes, and William Vereker meeting with 

colleagues from the North and Southeast Asia region.

 — Martin Brand and Kathleen DeRose meeting with colleagues  

from the EMEA region.

 — Martin Brand and Val Rahmani meeting with colleagues in the  

South Asia region.

 — Cressida Hogg and Tsega Gebreyes meeting with colleagues  

from the Americas region.

During 2023, the Group launched its new values via a global streaming 
event, watched by over 19,000 employees. The event was led by  
the Group CEO and other members of the Executive Committee.  
The values were developed with input from employees via focus 
groups, workshops and an all-employee survey. Further information  
on the new values can be found on page 60.

Townhalls were held at the Group and at Divisional levels, and topics 
were tailored to the different audiences with interactive Q&A sessions.  
A number of these townhalls were led by the CEO, CFO and other 
members of the Executive Committee. Over 13,000 colleagues 
participated in the global townhall for the 2022 full-year results.

The Group CEO and the Group CFO (and other members of the 
Executive Committee) hosted in-person and virtual engagement 
sessions with colleagues across the Group’s global locations to discuss 
topics of interest to colleagues. These sessions provided business 
updates and helped the Board and management to better understand 
employee concerns and key themes of interest to them. 

The annual “LSEG Engage” employee survey provided colleagues  
with an opportunity to share their views on working at LSEG. 88% of our 
colleagues participated, sharing over 25,000 comments, representing 
our highest level of participation to date. The results were then 
discussed with the Board. 

More information on employee engagement can be found on pages 60 
to 62 of the Strategic Report.

Key matters for stakeholder group
The key themes arising from the Board conversations and other 
engagements included were: 
 — Ease of doing business – making it easier to get things done, 

including increasing agility and empowering local client facing teams. 

 — Culture and values – focus from colleagues on developing an 

integrated and inclusive culture. Colleagues were supportive of the 
new values.

 — Communications – colleagues emphasised the importance of  

regular communication, including receiving updates on business 
performance, Group change projects and communications during 
times of crisis. 

 — Career development – talent acquisition and the desire for 
opportunities to develop their careers within the Group.

 — Customers – colleagues expressed to the Board the importance  
of being able to successfully deliver products and services for  
our customers.

 — Sustainability – the Board’s strategy on sustainability and achieving 

net zero.

How this engagement influenced Board discussions  
and decision-making
Employee feedback led to increased focus on communications to 
regional offices, including via Town Halls and visits to those locations.

The results of the Engage survey were presented to the Board as part  
of the annual presentation of People Strategy and culture by the Chief 
People Officer, including feedback which led to the development of the 
new values. The Board also reviewed areas of focus identified in the 
2023 Engage survey and reflected on themes such as barriers to 
execution that had also been highlighted in the 2022 Engage survey 
and actions taken to address these issues. 

Colleagues tell us that they  
value the engagement with Board 
members and the opportunity to 
provide honest feedback on their 
experiences at LSEG. Directors 
appreciate the Board conversations 
with colleagues as an invaluable 
way to understand the needs and 
feedback from the Group’s 
25,000+ employees.

Policymakers, regulators and supervisors

Maintaining an open and cooperative 
relationship with policymakers and regulators 
on matters that affect our Group, industry, 
customers and people is critically important.  
The Group has a significant number of 
regulated entities around the world. These 
entities are supervised at the legal entity level, 
with our primary regulators predominantly 
engaging with the boards of those entities 
rather than with the Group Board.

Countries we serve 

170+

How the Board has engaged
The Board considers policy, regulation and supervisory guidance 
globally and in the countries in which we operate that may affect  
the Group’s businesses. These matters are also discussed as part  
of the Chairs’ Forum (composed of the Chair of the Group Board  
and the chairs of a number of regulated subsidiaries), the outputs of 
which are provided by the Chair to the Group Board at subsequent 
Board meetings.

Key matters for stakeholder group
Relevant key matters include: market competitiveness, including  
the attractiveness of the UK as a global financial centre; data issues 
including localisation, privacy, sovereignty and regulation; sustainability 
and ESG issues; innovation and technology, including artificial 
intelligence and digital assets; and resilience and financial stability, 
including clearing, cloud and operational resilience.

How this engagement influenced Board discussions  
and decision-making
The Group Board takes into consideration the priorities and focus  
areas of policymakers and regulators when discharging its duties and 
responsibilities. This includes Board discussions on setting strategy  
and assessing the delivery of key objectives.

The Group CEO updates the Group Board on the views and priorities  
of regulators and policymakers.

The Board takes into consideration relevant regulatory issues when 
taking decisions, including in relation to matters such as M&A.

Suppliers 
Our third-party suppliers are also important stakeholders of the Group. 
Given their significance, management regularly reassesses the tiering  
of our suppliers based on factors including the degree of criticality of  
the goods/services being provided to LSEG, financial spend and risk.  
The Board approves all supplier contracts with a financial value of  
£50 million or more (over the lifetime of the contract), and receives 
updates on the management of, and relationships with third-party 
suppliers where appropriate.

The Risk Committee provides oversight of the risk relating to third-party 
suppliers to ensure these arrangements are managed within risk 
appetite and any issues are appropriately remediated.

In addition to the procurement and ongoing management of suppliers,  
a number of the Group’s subsidiaries are required to report their 
supplier performance and policies as part of the Small Business, 
Enterprise and Employment Act 2015. All payment terms and conditions 
are negotiated with our suppliers, and we ensure that purchase orders 
are raised and receipted in accordance with the Group’s policies.

The Company continues to be a signatory to the Prompt Payment Code, 
a voluntary code of practice for businesses, administered by the Office 
of the Small Business Commissioner on behalf of the Department for 
Business and Trade. It sets standards for payment practices between 
organisations of any size and their suppliers.

As a signatory, the Company has agreed to:
 — pay suppliers on time, within agreed terms;
 — give clear guidance to suppliers on terms, dispute resolution,  

and prompt notification of late payment; and

 — support good practice throughout their supply chain by encouraging 

adoption of the Prompt Payment Code.

Each year we publish a statement setting out the Group’s approach to 
managing its supply chain. More information on the Group’s approach  
to managing its supply chain, including the Group Modern Slavery 
Statement, can be found at: www.lseg.com/en/sustainability-strategy/

This section forms our Section 172 disclosure, detailing how the  
Board considered the matters set out in Section 172 (1) (a) to (f)  
of the Companies Act 2006. 

Section 172 requires a director to have regard, amongst other matters,  
to the: 
 — likely consequences of any decisions in the long term; 
 — interests of the company’s employees; 
 — need to foster the company’s business relationships with  

suppliers, customers and others; 

 — impact of the company’s operations on the community  

and environment; 

 — desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high 

standards of business conduct and; 

 — need to act fairly as between members of the company. 

Throughout the year, the Board engaged directly and indirectly with 
stakeholders to ensure it had a detailed understanding of the impact of 
the Group’s strategy on key stakeholders, as well as their interests and 
views. This engagement seeks to ensure the Board is well-informed on 
key issues to enable the Directors to comply with their Section 172(1) 
obligations. The Directors recognise that having a good understanding 
of the views and interests of the Group’s stakeholders is critical in 
delivering the Group’s strategy, and in relation to material decisions  
that were taken by the Board during the course of the year. The Board 
acknowledges that every decision it makes will not necessarily result  
in a positive outcome for all stakeholders.

The following principal decisions and activities demonstrate how the 
Board assessed and addressed different stakeholder interests and 
impacts in making decisions that support the implementation of the 
Group’s strategy. Principal decisions are those decisions taken by the 
Board that are deemed to be of strategic importance to the Group, or 
are significant to LSEG’s stakeholders. Examples of how the Board has 
considered key stakeholders, can be found below. Additional details  
on how our Board and its Committees operate, their responsibilities and 
key matters considered during 2023 are contained in the Committee 
Reports starting on page 106.

Section 172(1) Statement continued

Set out below are some examples of how the Directors have had regard to the matters set out in Section 172.

Key matter

Decision

Capital 
Allocation

The Board reviews and approves capital allocation across the Group and its business divisions. 
This is within the context of the current market conditions and macroeconomic outlook. The Board 
seeks to optimise the use of capital resources taking into account applicable regulatory 
requirements, strategic objectives and LSEG’s risk appetite. LSEG’s capital allocation approach 
focuses on: i) investing organically within the business; ii) investing in inorganic opportunities in 
line with the Group’s strategy; and iii) returns to investors. The Group continues to manage capital 
expenditure in line with strategic directions of growth and resilience. In 2023, the Group allocated 
45% of total capital expenditure to our Group strategic and transformational programmes, with  
the rest of the investment focusing on maintaining business resilience and operational needs.  
The impact of these capital allocation decisions was beneficial for key stakeholders such as 
customers, employees and shareholders. 

Dividend
As a result of the Group’s strong performance in 2023, the Board is recommending a final ordinary 
dividend of 79.3 pence per share, bringing the total ordinary dividend for 2023 to 115.0 pence  
per share, an 7.5% increase on 2022 (2022: total dividend 107 pence per share). As part of  
LSEG’s Capital Markets Day (additional information can be found below), LSEG announced  
a new simplified dividend policy, which will focus on paying progressive dividends, a targeted 
c.33-40% payout based on expected full-year adjusted earnings per share (AEPS); and a split  
of approximately one-third/two-thirds between the interim and final dividends. The simplified 
dividend policy aims to provide shareholders with consistent distributions, while retaining the 
flexibility to invest and continue to grow the business. 

Directed Share Buyback (DSBB)
The Directors utilised the authority obtained at the 2023 AGM to conduct a DSBB with the  
former Refinitiv shareholders. On 6 September 2023, the Company announced the off-market 
purchase of 9,500,466 limited voting ordinary shares for a total consideration of £750 million.  
The purchased shares were immediately cancelled. The purchased shares represented 1.73% of  
the Company’s issued share capital at the time (excluding treasury shares). 

The Board took into account the views of a wide range of stakeholders, when reviewing the 
impact of the DSBB. Board discussions considered matters such as the impact on the Group’s 
credit rating and leverage, capital demands, potential M&A, debt capacity, delivery of sustainable 
returns and, from a colleague perspective, ensuring support for the growth and investment plans 
of the business. The DSBB aligned with LSEG’s capital allocation policy, and resulted in a strong 
positive impact on investor sentiment. More information about the DSBB is included in the Chief 
Financial Officer review on page 46. In connection with LSEG’s Capital Markets Day (additional 
information can be found below), LSEG announced the intention to complete £1 billion of  
additional share buybacks during 2024. 

M&A 
Increasing ownership of LCH SA

In January 2023, Euronext submitted an early termination of its Derivatives Clearing Agreement 
with LCH SA. The termination notice triggered an option for LCH Group to buy back Euronext’s 
11.1% stake in LCH SA. The acquisition provided a prudent opportunity to simplify LCH’s 
governance structure and also demonstrated the strategic importance of LCH SA to the LCH 
Group. The acquisition resulted in the LCH Group’s controlling stake in LCH SA increasing from 
88.9% to 100%. The acquisition of Euronext’s 11.1% stake in LCH SA was for a total consideration  
of €111 million, which was valued by an independent valuer. 

The Board received updates on the status of the acquisition, considering key themes such  
as market landscape and the business performance outlook and approved the acquisition.  
The updates covered the financial metrics of the acquisition, particularly looking at significant 
trends impacting the LCH Group’s remaining business lines over the medium to long term and 
considering the implications for both LSEG and the wider industry. The Board acknowledged that 
the acquisition would be beneficial to employees and customers, as it provides greater certainty 
around LCH’s future.

Leverage 
Target & 
Funding 

Change in Leverage Target 
LSEG’s previous capital allocation policy included a leverage range of 1.0-2.0x operating net  
debt/adjusted EBITDA. In 2023, the Board reviewed whether this leverage range was an optimal 
capital structure for the Group. Post the Refinitiv acquisition, LSEG has become a demonstrably 
stronger, more diversified business with increased scale, quality of revenue, cash flow and stability. 
The Board concluded that a leverage range of 1.5-2.5x was more appropriate for LSEG and would 
enhance the Group’s ability to support organic or inorganic growth.

 — Customers
 — Employees
 — Shareholders
 — Regulators
 — Credit Rating 
Agencies 

 — Pension Schemes 

The Group intends to largely operate around the centre of the new range. The increased leverage 
range means that the Group will typically not operate below 1.5x (which would be relatively less 
efficient in terms of capital structure) and will have additional flexibility for capital allocation that  
will support investment in the business for the benefit of customers and help yield greater 
shareholder returns. When considering the change of leverage range, the Board carefully 
considered the impact on the Group’s credit rating. The Board also considered stakeholders  
such as regulators and the Group’s pension schemes.

2023 Refinancing Activities 
Euro Medium-Term Note Programme (EMTN) 

In August 2023, the Company updated its EMTN programme, which was last used to issue bonds 
in 2018. Under the updated programme, in September 2023, the Group issued €1.4 billion of 
three-year and seven-year bonds, with proceeds used to repay the remaining term loan entered 
into as part of the Refinitiv acquisition in 2021.

The Board considered different varieties of shelf long-term debt issuance programmes, 
considering each programme’s market depth, currency availability, execution flexibility and ease  
of administration. The Board considered whether it was in the Group’s best interests to complete 
the EMTN in the context of opportunities in other markets. It was concluded that it was the best 
course of action. In taking the decision to approve the EMTN and in overseeing the Group’s debt 
commitments, the Board gave due regard to the Section 172 factors, in particular the impact of  
the decision on shareholders and the long-term success of the Company.

LSEG hosted its Capital Markets Day (CMD) on 16 and 17 November 2023, which was an 
opportunity to better inform investors about the LSEG business and its future plans. Management 
demonstrated to stakeholders LSEG’s differentiating factors and the plans to accelerate growth, 
both through continued organic investment in LSEG’s leading businesses and progress on the 
strategic partnership with Microsoft. LSEG announced updated “medium-term guidance,” with the 
Board noting the benefits this would bring to its shareholders. These included: i) committing to  
mid to high single digit organic revenue growth annually, accelerating after 2024 as customers

its EBITDA margin; iii) a decline in capital expenditure to a high single-digit percentage of income

As mentioned above, in connection with the CMD, LSEG also announced the intention to return  
£1 billion to shareholders via additional share buybacks during 2024. In advance of doing so,  
the Board considered other potential uses of capital and the importance of being proactive in 
decisions around LSEG’s use of excess capital.

Key matter

Decision

Strategic 
Partnership 
with Microsoft

In December 2022, LSEG announced its strategic partnership with Microsoft. During 2023, the 
Board considered progress of the strategic partnership at every meeting and reviewed a number 
of its key initiatives. Key developments during 2023 included: i) the combination of Microsoft’s 
strong expertise in generative artificial intelligence in conjunction with LSEG’s unparalleled 
breadth and depth of trusted data and analytics to enable LSEG to further streamline workflow  
and generate new insights; ii) the launch of Microsoft Fabric, which will be the cornerstone of 
LSEG’s Data Platform; iii) the Design Partner Programme, which is engaging a number of global 
financial institutions operating across the trade lifecycle to help inform product development,  
trial prototypes and give feedback as part of an agile and iterative process; and iv) a number  
of applications entering external pilot and general availability from H1 2024. 

The Microsoft partnership demonstrates how the Group remains competitive and ensures it 
maintains a strong market position, investing to transform the customer experience. The Board is 
committed to further strengthening LSEG’s product offering, optimising technology infrastructure 
and increasing efficiencies within LSEG’s operations. The Board considered and took into account 
the views and interests of customers in respect of the strategic partnership, with LSEG and 
Microsoft engaging with strategic customers during 2023. This influenced the development of 
technology solutions and was an opportunity for customers to provide their insights, expertise  
and key needs.

Sustainability

LSEG is committed to being an enabler of sustainable economic growth. During 2023,  
the Board continued to consider both internal and external stakeholders when reviewing  
LSEG’s sustainability approach and the management of climate risks, opportunities and impacts.

The Board noted shareholders’ expectations for the Company to have a robust approach to 
sustainability, that customers require solutions to support their own sustainability ambitions  
and that our employees have sought to work for a company that values sustainability. LSEG’s 
sustainability approach, including the public targets and activities, also affects the Group’s supply 
chain, as well as the communities within which we operate. More details on LSEG’s approach to 
sustainability, can be found in the Sustainability section on page 58 and in the separate 2023 
Sustainability Report.

Managing risk is fundamental  
to the successful execution  
of our strategy and to the 
resilience of our operations.

In addition to our principal risks, we continue to identify and monitor 
emerging risks which are newly developing external risks and are 
difficult to quantify due to their remote or evolving nature. In most  
cases, the mitigation for such emerging risks is to establish appropriate 
contingency plans and monitor the development of the risk until it  
can be quantified and removed or included as a principal risk.

For each principal risk, the Group has executive leads with the  
Chief Risk Officer and Risk function providing a second line of  
oversight. The risk trend, shown for each principal risk, is based  
on the Group’s 2023 risk profile. 

Further information
Our strategic risk objectives, current risk focus, a narrative description  
of our risk appetite, how LSEG’s Risk Management Framework operates, 
and an overview of the Central Counterparty (CCP) risk management 
and operations, are well established and are described below.

Risk management 
The effective management of risk is critical to the execution of the 
Group’s strategy. Accordingly, the Group maintains a robust enterprise-
wide Risk Management Framework which sets out the Group’s approach 
to risk management and its appetite for taking risks. Our regulated 
entities, including clearing houses, manage their risks in-line with both 
local regulation and internal risk and investment policies.

Risk culture
A strong risk culture requires everyone to understand and embrace  
their role in managing risks as this is critical to the effective embedding 
of the Risk Management Framework.

Risk culture is a key enabler of the three lines of defence model,  
used to manage risk within LSEG, and is promoted by the Risk 
Management Framework in three ways:
1.  It sets expectations by articulating risk appetite and desired 

behaviours through policies

2.  It ensures risk is considered in key business decisions through 

frameworks and tools

3.  It ensures risk is made transparent and included in accountability  

and performance management

Three lines of defence
The three lines of defence model provides appropriate segregation  
of duties and clear roles and responsibilities across LSEG business 
divisions, corporate functions, Risk, Compliance and Internal Audit.  
It clearly defines roles and responsibilities, with accountability for  
risk management sitting within the first line of defence.

Risk management approach 
The Enterprise Risk Management Framework manages risk throughout 
the full risk lifecycle. It is in place to support the ongoing and systemic 
identification, evaluation, management, monitoring and reporting of the 
significant risks faced and the mitigating controls in place against them. 
This process is supported by robust risk governance, designed to give  
a coherent view of risk across the full Group.

In order to maintain a risk management system that applies effectively 
and consistently across all areas of the business, we have in place a 
“risk taxonomy”. This is an inventory of all types of risk that are identified 
as inherent in business strategies and objectives, including strategic, 
non-financial and financial risks.

These risks are reflected in the Group risk appetite statements  
and are managed through principles set out in the Group’s policies.  
Risk assessments determine whether risks are within the appetite set  
by the Board and are reported to senior management and the Board.

Group level committees: An overall Group Executive Risk Committee 
and Group-level subcommittees, including the Financial Risk (which 
includes a Model Risk subcommittee), Technology, Cyber and Resilience 
Risk and Non-Financial Risk Committee which meet on a regular basis. 
Other sub committees, such as the Reputational or New Product and 
Market Committee meet on an ad-hoc basis, as required.

Each of the risk committees has detailed terms of reference, approved 
by the Board or their parent committee, setting out their respective  
roles and responsibilities.

Group risk appetite 
Risk appetite is the level of risk that LSEG will accept in pursuit of its 
strategic objectives and is aligned with the Group’s strategy. The risk 
appetite is a central pillar of the Enterprise Risk Management Framework 
and is used as a benchmark for both risk assessment and monitoring, 
with regular reporting of aggregated risks to both the Board Risk 
Committee and Group Executive Risk Committee.

The Board approves LSEG’s risk appetite annually. This is cascaded 
throughout the organisation with divisions and functions establishing 
more detailed risk appetite statements and monitoring their risk profile 
against the agreed appetite levels.

Risks that are outside risk appetite are escalated to Executive 
Committee members and to the appropriate Risk Committee  
and Boards.

Risk governance
Risk governance and oversight is enabled through an effective 
governance structure comprising Board level committees (Board,  
Audit and Risk) and executive level committees to promote active 
discussion and resolution of risk issues.

The risk framework defines the risk roles, responsibilities and 
governance structure. The risk governance structure ensures the 
appropriate expertise and overall input in order to adequately  
oversee and challenge the risk positions across the Group.

The Risk committees, subcommittees and relevant working groups  
are embedded within the overall governance structure of the Group.  
A group and divisional committee structure provides risk oversight  
with escalations between forums as needed (see the diagram below).

Global 
economic  
and geopolitical 
risk

Risk overview
Whilst the Group is well diversified, global economic 
underperformance or the influence of geopolitical relations  
on global financial markets could have an adverse impact  
on LSEG’s people, businesses, operations and financial 
performance.

Risk description
The Group operates in a broad range of equity, fixed income, 
foreign exchange and derivative markets, servicing customers 
who increasingly seek global products and innovative solutions. 
If the global economy underperforms, or there is reduced 
activity in LSEG’s markets, it may lead to lower revenues.  
As central banks have taken steps to counteract inflationary 
pressures, mainly through raising interest rates, financial 
markets have been impacted. This has heightened the risk of 
recession in advanced economies and the risk of default in 
some emerging economies. An environment that exposes 
banks’ weaknesses and leads to sector consolidation may also 
lead to lower revenues. More broadly, geopolitical relations 
continue to influence global financial markets, particularly  
the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine which is 
impacting global food supplies, the conflict between Israel  
and Hamas, and Western relations with China. 

The Group’s income streams benefit from diversification 
across both a broad global footprint and large customer base, 
helping to mitigate the exposure to localised economic and 
credit downturns. Furthermore, a significant proportion of 
income streams across LSEG’s business divisions comprise 
subscription-fee based recurring revenues, limiting the 
Group’s exposure to shorter-term movements in the global 
credit cycle. In conditions of volatility, the Group benefits from 
market infrastructure capabilities exposed to trading volumes 
and pricing movements, including FX venues, LSE Plc 
secondary markets, Tradeweb and LCH Group.

Additionally, the Group performs regular monitoring and 
assessment of the potential impacts of market prices  
and volume movements. It also monitors and manages 
exposures to the market through hedging both foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks, tracking key risk indicators 
and stress testing financial resilience. 

The Group also regularly monitors external threats and 
emerging risks including geopolitics and incorporates  
the output into business continuity and strategic plans. 
Furthermore, the Enterprise, Financial and Model Risk 
Committee monitors and reviews multiple financial  
metrics and scenarios including response to changes in 
macroeconomic conditions, with mitigating actions agreed.

Risk overview
Sustainability risk can be defined broadly as an environmental, 
social or governance event or condition that, if it occurs, can 
cause significant negative financial or non-financial impact  
on the Group. Sustainability risk also includes the opportunity  
that may be available to LSEG as a result of changing social, 
economic or environmental as well as regulatory factors. 

Sustainability risks are managed in line with LSEG’s Enterprise 
Risk Management Framework and integrated within the  
Group’s risk taxonomy. The specificities associated with the 
management of sustainability-related risks, which are 
embedded within multiple other risks within the taxonomy,  
are defined in LSEG’s Sustainability Risk Management 
Framework, which was approved by the Board in 2023.

Risk description
Sustainability risk encompasses a wide variety of other 
individual risks which are diverse in nature, from regulatory 
reporting and diversity and inclusion, to greenwashing and  
net zero, amongst others. Sustainability remains an area of 
policy development, impacting financial market participants  
and corporates, bringing with it reputational, regulatory and 
potential litigation risks.  

The scope of climate risk encompasses both physical and 
transitional risks. Physical risks are acute and chronic risks 
which may impact LSEG’s people as well as its global, 
geographically dispersed property portfolio. Transitional risks 
are factors such as product availability, policy, regulatory and 
market related developments that may impact the Group’s 
business as the world transitions to a Paris-aligned carbon 
emission trajectory.  

Please see the Sustainability section on pages 58 to 68 and 
LSEG’s 2023 Sustainability Report for more information on 
LSEG’s approach to sustainability.

With regards to climate change, LSEG has taken proactive steps 
to develop its methodology to understand the impact on its 
businesses, both from a risk and opportunity perspective.  
The Group aims to reinforce its resilience to both physical  
and transitional risks, including how the transition will impact 
demand for financial products and services. The Group has 
advanced its assessment of climate risk and continues to 
undertake an assessment of its global infrastructure portfolio, 
utilising climate diagnostic models to identify future physical 
climate change risks. The intention is to use this work to quantify 
exposure to physical climate risk for property damage and 
business interruption, as well as integration into its Group-wide 
property location strategy. From a transitional climate risk 
perspective, the Group has also made progress mapping  
out and quantifying the potential impact of utilising carbon 
pricing internally, initially piloting on business travel with a view 
to a future Group-wide rollout. 

Furthermore, in 2023, the Group’s risk taxonomy was  
updated to provide more visibility for sustainability risks,  
with sustainability added at a strategic level, including 
greenwashing. Sustainability was also considered as part  
of the annual risk and control assessment process.

LSEG actively monitors the use of its brands to identify, 
address and prevent any infringements. Policies and 
procedures including brand guidelines are in place to 
ensure the appropriate use of the Group’s brands and  
to manage the integrity of the Group’s reputation. Where 
material reputational issues arise, Group Committee 
meetings are held to address such issues. Further, 
corporate affairs, marketing and corporate responsibility 
plans are in place to govern internal and external 
stakeholder engagement. Our new Group values outline 
the way we work with our customers, our partners and each 
other and our Code of Conduct continues to support the 
protection of our reputation. We each have a duty to act 
with the highest levels of integrity, at all times, to maintain 
the legacy of trust that LSEG has developed with its many 
stakeholders. In addition, the Group protects its intellectual 
property by relying upon a combination of trademark, 
copyright, patent and design laws, trade secret protection, 
database rights, confidentiality agreements and other 
contractual arrangements with its employees, affiliates, 
customers, suppliers, strategic partners and others.

Transformation Risk is reduced by the application of the 
Group’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework deploying 
consistent, appropriate risk management and mitigation 
across the Group, both during strategic transformation 
activity and throughout acquisitions and divestments. 

The Group Transformation Forum, a subcommittee of the 
Executive Committee, is responsible for the successful 
delivery and risk management of the Group Strategic 
Programmes. Furthermore, a partnership governance 
structure has been implemented to oversee the delivery  
of the LSEG-Microsoft Partnership. Oversight and assurance 
across the Group’s change portfolio is provided by Group 
Risk and Internal Audit.

The Group’s Change Framework provides a robust 
governance and programme management structure  
that has delivered an effective track record of integrating 
acquisitions, separating disposals and delivering  
tangible synergies in an evolving regulatory and 
technological landscape.

Risk overview
The Group’s globally recognised and trusted brands, now 
unified under a single brand name, face the risk that an event  
or incident could damage their value or the Group’s reputation.

Risk description
The strong reputation of LSEG’s businesses is valuable for its 
credibility with regulators and its attractiveness to customers 
and potential workforce. As these businesses are now more 
closely aligned under one Group, there is greater potential for  
a single event or incident to damage the reputation and value 
of the LSEG brand and also impact LSEG-branded products 
more broadly. Some of the Group’s products and processes 
may also include material which are not subject to intellectual 
property protection by the Group, and competitors of the Group 
may also independently develop or otherwise protect similar  
or the same products or processes. This could result in 
reputational damage, impacting LSEG’s ability to attract new  
or retain existing business and could cause the Group to incur 
financial costs to defend or enforce intellectual property rights.

Risk overview
The Group is materially exposed to risk of loss or failure  
resulting from transformation or integration as it continues  
to grow rapidly both organically and inorganically.

Risk description
In 2023, LSEG continued to deliver on its transformation agenda, 
including material change delivered through the Group Strategic 
Programmes, mobilisation of the LSEG-Microsoft Partnership  
and its M&A strategy. While acquisitions required the Group to 
operate and integrate different technology platforms and 
systems, divestments required the Group to provide transitional 
support to divested businesses. Challenges for the Group 
included maintaining the operational resilience and security  
of legacy platforms, and consolidating services, or developing  
new services, where underlying assets used to provide those 
services are subject to third-party contractual commitments.

As LSEG makes acquisitions, these may be complex or 
necessitate change to operating or business models, technology 
and people. The LSEG-Microsoft partnership will also result in 
changes to LSEG’s products, commercial models and go-to-
market distribution. LSEG’s success will depend on its ability to 
integrate all parts of the business (including acquisitions), realise 
synergies and ensure it can compete globally. Failure to align its 
businesses may result in additional cost without a commensurate 
revenue increase, a failure to capture future product and market 
opportunities, and increased risk relating to capital requirements, 
regulatory relationships and management time.

Furthermore, since the Group’s markets for data, information, 
services and products are highly competitive and subject to 
rapid technological change and evolving customer demands 
and needs, the Group has a sizeable strategic change agenda 
to transform its products, services and platforms as it leverages 
growth synergies, upgrades and replaces legacy infrastructure, 
and transitions to the cloud.

Risk overview
The Group’s CCP activities – through LCH – expose it to a 
number of financial risks that arise from the CCP’s obligation  
to guarantee the performance of cleared contracts between  
its members in the event of a member default.

Risk description
In the event of a member default, the CCP must restore  
a matched book by liquidating or transferring the defaulting 
member’s positions held with the CCP. This can expose the  
CCP to both adverse changes in the market value of the 
positions (such as changes in asset prices, interest rates,  
credit spreads and foreign exchange) and liquidation costs 
(such as the cost of finding liquidity to exit the positions).  
In addition, the CCP has market, credit and liquidity risks  
arising from the investment of members’ cash and its ongoing 
payment obligations. Non-financial risks such as operational, 
legal and compliance and reputational risks, arise as a result  
of the CCP’s day-to-day operations.

Model risk 

Executive lead
Divisional Group Heads, 
Chief Risk Officer

Risk trend

Risk overview
The advent of Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models 
necessitates new approaches for model risk management. As 
such, the Group’s model risks could arise from the omission of 
models from the model inventory and from errors made during 
the data sourcing, development and implementation stages. 
Risks can also arise from the incorrect use of models, and/or 
from errors in the decisions made based on model outputs.

Risk description
The Group utilises an increasing suite of models, including 
Artificial Intelligence, across all of its divisions (e.g., margin 
models used within our CCPs, D&A client facing analytics, 
market abuse detection models within the Capital Markets 
division, and stress models used to calculate capital and  
climate risk). Model risks could impact both the reputation  
and the financial condition of the Group.

CCPs by design are financially resilient against the largest 
default risks. The CCP rulebook is the foundation of its 
resilience and is a legally binding document, signed by 
members, that governs all clearing activities. It details the 
authority of the CCP to assess appropriate margins, to 
place a member in default and to liquidate a defaulting 
member’s positions and collateral. The key lines of defence 
laid out in the CCP rulebook include minimum standards  
for member eligibility, initial and additional margins posted 
by members, a portion of the CCP’s own capital, and then 
member default funds and mutualisation of losses. 
Additionally, the CCP can perform assessment to further 
absorb losses beyond the default fund. The resiliency  
of these mechanisms is tested via an annual fire-drill.

In its cash investment activities, the CCP’s primary objective 
is to protect principal and liquidity and to ensure prompt 
availability of cash when needed. Establishing strict criteria 
for the eligibility of counterparties and investment types 
and a limits structure minimises investment risk, however 
the risk will not be completely eliminated. 

Additionally, unsecured commercial bank deposits are 
strictly limited to 5% of the investment portfolio. Outright 
bond purchases are limited to high-quality short-term 
sovereign bonds or equivalent, and deposits at central 
banks and secured placements (reverse repos) are 
preferred where possible. All issuers and counterparties 
are subject to internal credit scoring and regular reviews.

Furthermore, the effectiveness of the investment and 
liquidity risk framework, namely operational capacity, and 
ability to raise liquidity are tested in quarterly “war games” 
exercises to ensure ongoing resiliency, as well as annual 
default fire-drills.

LSEG businesses have an industry standard model risk 
control and governance framework in place, including  
a model risk policy and model management system.  
In addition, robust model validation is performed across 
LSEG’s full suite of models to ensure that the Group’s 
critical models are fit for purpose. Model lifecycle  
controls are also in place, including ongoing performance 
monitoring for key models and tracking of changes for  
all models. In addition, risk oversight is provided by the 
Model Risk Committee which is a subcommittee of the 
Enterprise, Financial and Model Risk Committee, and model 
risk management undertakes reviews to identify models 
that could impact the Group.

Risk overview
LSEG is highly dependent on the development and operation of 
its sophisticated technology and advanced information systems 
and those of its third-party service and outsourcing providers.

Risk description
Technology failures potentially leading to system outages may 
impact the Group’s customers and the orderly running of its 
markets, data services and distribution. 

The resilience of technology systems and processes 
underpinning important business services remains a high 
priority for the Group, with significant investment allocated 
to the improvement of the technology estate. Key 
performance and risk indicators provide a view across  
the Group’s systems and enable tuning of improvement 
activity to maximise benefits to resilience. Enhancement to 
monitoring tools allow for preventative measures to avoid 
issues, and a prompt response to any potential service-
impacting incident. Overall, the number and severity of 
incidents linked to the legacy estate continues to decline.

Regular rigorous business impact and operational  
risk scenario analysis is performed to identify, assess  
and remediate potential system and governance 
vulnerabilities. In addition, technology solutions are 
comprehensively tested by both LSEG Technology and 
third-party quality assurance providers as appropriate; 
functional, non-functional, user-acceptance and other 
testing is performed across technology environments to 
ensure products are ready for deployment and have robust 
business continuity and crisis management plans in place.

The risks associated with change are mitigated by 
implementation of the Group’s change framework. 
Appropriate governance, risk and executive oversight  
is exercised over individual programmes and projects 
based on the scale, complexity and impact of the change. 
The purpose of this oversight is to ensure that changes  
do not breach the Group’s risk appetite and are compliant 
with the approved project management policy, as well  
as to manage budget, resource, escalations, risk, issues  
and dependencies. For software specific development, 
software design methodologies, testing regimes and  
test environments are continuously being enhanced to 
minimise implementation risk.

Risk overview
As a global financial markets infrastructure and data provider, 
LSEG is exposed to cyber risk. The cyber threat landscape 
continues to increase in sophistication with the evolving 
geopolitical landscape and emerging technology.

Risk description
The financial sector and the wider economy continue to 
experience notable cyber incidents, showcasing the advanced 
capabilities of cyber adversaries and the significant impact  
they can have on the targeted organisation. Cyber risk arises 
from the use of data, technology and digital services by  
LSEG and its supply chain. In addition to the direct impact that  
a cyber event can pose on LSEG and its customers, the Group’s 
role as a financial markets infrastructure provider means that  
a significant cyber event could create a systemic impact  
to the financial sector and the global markets that it services.  
To remain competitive in this era of data and digitalisation,  
cyber risk cannot be eliminated, however, it can be managed  
to a level of risk that the Group is prepared to take as a cost  
of doing business.

Risk overview
The Group is exposed to the risk of operational disruptions  
that may impact its customers and the financial stability of 
capital markets. As a result, business continuity is one of the  
key objectives of the Group’s operational resilience strategy.  
It helps to address the Group’s ability to prevent, adapt to, 
respond and recover from operational disruptions and to 
minimise their impacts.

Risk description
While the Group has processes and controls in place to ensure 
the continuity of its services and operations, unforeseen  
events such as physical security, cyber security and increased 
geopolitical incidents could impact the continuity of the Group’s 
services. Annual crisis management training is completed at the 
Group and business unit levels, focusing on staff wellbeing and 
any impact on critical business areas. A robust incident and 
crisis escalation process is in place and routinely in use.

The Group continues to make significant investments in 
cyber security and has a dedicated Cyber Security function 
led by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) whose 
role is focused on protecting and defending LSEG against 
cyber attacks. Due to the increasing sophistication of cyber 
adversaries and their techniques, the Group proactively 
collects and evaluates actionable threat intelligence. While 
LSEG recognises that the prevention of cyber attacks may 
not always be possible, the Group’s priority is on remaining 
resilient to withstand cyber-attacks with minimal disruption 
to its business.

Furthermore, LSEG’s approach to cyber security aligns  
with industry frameworks such as the Cyber Risk Institute 
profile version of the National Institute of Standards  
and Technology cyber security framework. In addition, 
given that some of LSEG’s divisions are highly regulated,  
the Group ensures that the requisite assurance 
requirements are met. LSEG has made significant 
investments in cyber security and will continue to  
invest in, and advance its cyber defence, protect,  
detect, respond and recover capabilities.

The Group has been updating its business continuity plans 
for critical services, including important business services 
throughout 2023, in line with operational resilience 
requirements. These plans have been made available  
on a central Group-wide risk platform.

LSEG continues to operate a three-tiered Group crisis 
management framework, allowing effective and relevant 
escalations and decision-making, based on any given 
incident impact or severity. A Group crisis management 
manual and one-page plan are in place, routinely updated 
when management changes occur and used in training 
exercises. Additionally, scenario-specific crisis playbooks 
(e.g., for an energy crisis or potential geopolitical events) 
are in place to guide the crisis team decision-making.

The Group has also completed location-specific business 
continuity plans for key LSEG locations. These include  
crisis playbooks together with a summary of business and 
people exposure and related business continuity strategies. 
We have also launched plans to test crisis management 
teams in these locations.

Risk overview
The Group’s ability to deliver its strategic objectives may be 
impacted by failure to manage the financial, regulatory and 
reputational risks associated with the selection, management, 
and oversight of critical third parties.

Risk description
The Group and its entities engage third-party service providers, 
including cloud service providers, that are exposed to a range 
of non-financial, operational risks such as geopolitical and  
cyber security threats and regulatory compliance risk. The 
Group has engaged cloud service providers to host critical 
services and data. It also relies on access to certain data used 
in its business through licences with third parties. Some of  
this data is provided exclusively by suppliers and may not  
be obtained from other sources.

Risk events may result in these third parties being unable  
to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality or  
other obligations to the Group which in turn could lead to 
material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and 
reputational harm. 

Data

Risk overview
LSEG collects, processes, licenses, calculates, owns, transforms, 
administers and distributes data in many formats. Failure to 
govern its data successfully could result in those data being 
unfit for purpose with respect to quality and usage.

Risk description
LSEG plays a significant role in the financial markets 
infrastructure and data landscape with commitments to its 
customers, counterparties, owners, vendors, regulators and  
the public in the proper usage of its data.

If the Group’s data becomes unfit for purpose, resulting in the 
Group or its customers and/or stakeholders utilising deficient 
data for decision-making, the Group’s reputation, financial 
condition and operating results could be adversely impacted. 

Furthermore, data privacy breaches, unauthorised data access, 
misuse of personal data or failure to protect confidential 
information could adversely affect the Group’s reputation or 
financial performance, or expose it to litigation or other legal  
or regulatory actions. 

The Group continues to refine its third-party Risk 
Management Framework to provide controls across all 
stages of the third-party lifecycle, covering: planning and 
selecting, contracting and onboarding, managing and 
monitoring, and termination and exit. The framework helps 
to ensure that the Group identifies, assesses, remediates, 
monitors and reports risk at key stages in the lifecycle,  
and actively manages relationships with critical third  
parties to avoid a breakdown in service provision.

Additionally, LSEG focuses on the ability of critical  
third parties to continue to supply goods and services  
in accordance with requirements and in compliance  
with contractual obligations. Throughout the year,  
there have been no significant impacts to the supply  
chain for the Group.

LSEG’s Enterprise Information Governance function, 
together with divisional Chief Data Officers, work to 
develop and institute a comprehensive governance 
framework to ensure LSEG data is of the highest quality  
in order to support its intended use and the needs of its 
stakeholders, customers and regulators. The Group data 
policy and its framework promote a data culture that 
embodies customers’ needs, improves efficiency and 
quality of decision-making, and ensures adherence to 
regulatory obligations. As such, the Group has defined  
and implemented a standardised approach to data 
management oversight, governance, controls, measures 
and monitoring, as well as efficient issue resolution to 
mitigate any adverse impacts to the business.

In addition, the Group’s data protection and privacy policy 
sets out a framework for privacy compliance to ensure  
that personal data that is processed during the Group’s 
business is used fairly, lawfully and in compliance with all 
applicable data protection and privacy legislation. The 
Group’s information security policy includes a framework  
for data leakage prevention and information security 
incident management. LSEG employees complete annual, 
mandatory training courses on the Group’s policies.

Data is an aspect of the operational resilience programme. 
This means it is subject to a governance and control 
framework which ensures identification and management  
of data vulnerabilities as well as driving effective data 
recovery and the overall resilience of the Group’s important 
business services.

Risk overview
The Group’s people and talent risks could arise from a lack  
of critical skills, talent and knowledge, resulting in the Group  
being unable to achieve its objectives.

Risk description
People and talent risks can arise from multiple factors including 
insufficient career development, inadequate compensation 
processes and ineffective organisational structures and 
leadership, all of which could lead to lack of engagement  
and wellbeing of its people. Furthermore, increased market 
competition and challenging geopolitical or economic 
conditions could result in inability to attract and retain  
diverse, high-performing talent, and/or it could lead to  
a disengaged workforce.

Risk overview
LSEG is a global business operating in many regulatory 
environments and is exposed to changes to those environments 
and how it manages compliance with regulatory requirements.

Risk description
Regulatory risks that LSEG may face include: risks arising from 
the conditions under which the Group can access a particular 
market (e.g. EU equivalence for UK CCPs); the regulation and 
supervision of new activities; market competitiveness, including 
the attractiveness of the UK as a financial centre; data issues 
including localisation, privacy, sovereignty and regulation; 
sanctions issuance; sustainability and ESG issues; innovation 
and technology, including artificial intelligence and digital 
assets; and resilience and financial stability, including clearing, 
cloud and operational resilience. 

In the year, we launched new values to underpin its 
purpose, ensuring consistency in behaviour and culture 
across the Group. There continues to be focus on equity, 
diversity and inclusion, including refreshed ambitions and 
priorities, active inclusion networks, and enhanced policies 
and benefits to foster a culture of belonging. Talent 
identification, succession planning and career development 
frameworks initially launched in 2022 were expanded and 
evolved in the year, along with launching the Career 
Navigator platform, to support colleagues in ensuring they 
have appropriate skills and resources available to 
undertake their roles effectively and to support their career 
journey at LSEG. The Group continued with leadership 
development engagements across all stages of leadership, 
and delivered a framework for promotion and progression. 
LSEG operates a hybrid working model, driving 
connectivity, collaboration, productivity and development.

The Group has a dedicated Compliance function which  
is focused on identifying and remediating areas where 
compliance controls need to be improved. There are 
centralised compliance resources supporting the 
organisation as a whole with application of Group  
level controls, and resources carrying out compliance  
assurance controls. 

In addition to the overall Group Compliance function, 
compliance resources with specialised knowledge of  
each of the regulated services provided by the Group are 
aligned with the regulated entities operating within each 
business division. They provide regulatory advice to the 
business, corporate functions and committees to support 
them in seeking to ensure that both day-to-day operations 
and business developments are undertaken in accordance 
with the relevant regulatory obligations.

Furthermore, compliance policies are reviewed regularly 
and employees across the Group are reminded of the 
requirements to which they are subject under these 
policies through mandatory annual training, the completion 
of which is tracked.

Risk overview
The markets that LSEG serve could be changed by an increase 
in competitive pressures and lower entry barriers, caused by 
structural market changes, new business models and new 
advances in cloud, Artificial Intelligence, quantum computing 
and distributed ledger technology.

Risk description
Change driven by developments in disruptive technology could 
negatively impact the Group’s core business performance and 
disrupt its commercial models. This risk could impact the entire 
business, given the pace of change of business models, 
technological advancements and the continued increasing  
pace of market entrants.

Cloud providers are expanding their capabilities from storage  
to a wide range of data management and analytics solutions. 
They also enable a whole new ecosystem of providers, 
including new market entrants, who can now take advantage  
of cloud providers’ customer bases and fast development cycle. 

The increased use of AI internally and among customers brings 
with it associated risks such as inherent bias and automated 
decision-making and data management. It will also introduce 
new challenges for cyber security defence and detective 
mechanisms. Quantum computing could revolutionise the field 
of cloud and AI by enabling faster machine learning, facilitating 
new commercial opportunities, but may potentially amplify some 
cyber security and AI risks.

As technology and regulatory clarity improves, aggressive 
competitor activity in distributed ledger technology could 
increase risk of disruption. Distributed ledger technology 
presents potential disruptive risk to parts of LSEG’s business  
as it may result in a reduced need for centralised intermediaries, 
thereby bypassing some of the services offered by the Group.

The Group actively monitors new technological 
developments and the pace of change, developing robust 
innovative strategies to mitigate the risk resulting from 
emerging technology. The Group, including through its 
Strategy function, actively scans for potential investment 
opportunities in emerging technology. In addition, the 
Group partners with advisers and builds proof of concepts 
to test new hypotheses and, by collaborating with its 
customers, can identify and quickly react to changing 
consumption preferences.

Regulators are actively exploring the application of new 
frameworks to manage the development of innovative 
financial services technologies. It is expected that these  
will be important for maintaining resilience and stability  
in the market while enabling innovation with emerging 
technology. The Group also participates in relevant industry 
and academic forums, partnering closely with regulators.

Furthermore, the Group continues to maintain systems  
and controls to mitigate the risk resulting from emerging 
technology. Risk arising from the Group’s use of cloud,  
AI and distributed ledger technology is identified,  
assessed, managed and reported through the risk 
framework. LSEG is aligned with industry best practices  
and guidance when considering increased use of AI and 
distributed ledger technology. In 2023, the Group also 
launched its own Responsible AI Framework.

Scenario

Assumption

Global Financial 
Crisis (with and 
without inflation)

Global Pandemic

Cyber Security 
Threats

Supply Chain 
Disruption

A replay of the 2008 crisis, 
reassessed for purpose and 
fitness with current market 
conditions. The scenario 
considers the collapse of  
a major financial institution 
and a simultaneous default of 
one medium-sized (domestic 
rather than international) 
bank. Additionally, the 
scenario includes the 
consolidation of four globally 
systemic banks into two. 

The scenario considers the 
proliferation of Covid-19,  
or a similar pandemic, with 
significant impacts throughout 
the global value chain.  
There are severe, highly 
synchronised downturns 
associated with a persistent 
loss of output in developed 
and emerging economies. 
Governments worldwide 
implement restrictions on 
human interaction and travel 
to control virus contagion  
and interest rate changes. 

The scenario considers  
a cyber ransomware attack 
impacting the Group’s ability 
to serve a large portion of  
its customers.

This scenario assumes  
key supplier unavailability 
due to geopolitical or 
technological issues, which 
results in the delayed 
delivery of one of the Group’s 
key strategic programmes.

Financial viability  
statement 

In accordance with provision 31 of the Code, the Directors confirm that 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to 
operate and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, for the next three years. 
A period of three years has been chosen for the purpose of this viability 
statement, in line with the Group’s business plan.

Viability period
The Directors’ assessment has been made with reference to the  
Group’s current position and prospects, the Group’s three-year  
business plan, the Group’s risk appetite and the expected impact  
of severe but plausible downside scenarios. 

Given the Group’s acquisitive nature in recent years and future  
organic growth strategy, a three-year window is considered the most 
appropriate horizon for the Group’s management to make its viability 
statement because it is the period over which it can forecast with 
reasonable clarity, the Group’s financial performance, cash flows and 
strategic position. A 12-month period from the expected date of the 
signing of the financial statements is considered for the going concern 
assessment (see note 1.2 to the financial statements on page 176).

Business planning process
The business plan makes certain assumptions about the performance  
of the core revenue streams and segments, using existing product lines 
as well as assumptions on take-up of new product lines. It considers 
known inorganic activity, as well as assumptions on: the appropriate 
levels of investment to support expected performance; the ability to 
refinance debt as required; and expected returns to shareholders.

Assessment of viability
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out on 
pages 79 to 88 of the Strategic report. In addition, the Financial Risk 
management note on page 223 of this report includes: the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives; and its exposure to credit risk, liquidity  
risk and market risk. 

The business plan is stress tested using severe but plausible downside 
scenarios as determined relevant by the Financial Risk Committee,  
over the full three-year plan period. These scenarios are then  
assessed against the Group’s risk appetite parameters. Impacts  
on the performance of core revenue streams and segments are 
modelled through business inputs, with appropriate mitigating factors  
also considered.

The scenarios modelled are discussed in the table opposite.

The results show that a repeat of the Global Financial Crisis would have 
the largest impact on Group EBITDA. No scenario over the three-year 
period leads to a breach of the Group’s risk appetite thresholds, or an 
inability to meet the Group’s financial obligations through insufficient 
headroom. The likelihood of these scenarios materialising is viewed  
as remote.

Borrowing facilities
The Group’s borrowing facilities and respective repayment dates,  
and the net debt position of the Group, are included in note 7 to  
the financial statements, on pages 245 to 246. 

Conclusion
The Directors assessed the prospects and viability of the Group in 
accordance with provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
taking into account the Group’s three-year business plan, and the 
principal risks to the Group’s future performance and liquidity.  
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has  
the ability to meet its obligations over the viability period.

Corporate governance  
introduction

The Board is responsible for the 
long-term sustainable success  
of the Company, generating value 
for shareholders and contributing 
to wider society.

Don Robert 
Chair

Dear Shareholders, 

I am very pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2023. This report provides an overview  
of how LSEG is governed, the activities of the Board and the control 
structures we have in place. The Board is responsible for the long-term 
sustainable success of the Company, generating value for shareholders 
and contributing to wider society. The Board does this by supporting 
and challenging executive management to ensure we operate to high 
governance standards. This report explains how we seek to achieve 
this. It also contains some highlights from my perspective as Chair. 

Together with the reports of the Committees, we have set out how the 
UK Corporate Governance Code has been applied in the year. At the 
heart of the Code is a set of principles that emphasise the value of  
good corporate governance to long-term sustainable success. 

Board composition and diversity 
On 1 February 2023, Scott Guthrie joined the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director in connection with the strategic partnership with Microsoft. Scott 
has worked at Microsoft for over 25 years and currently holds position 
as Executive Vice President, Cloud and AI Group. Further information on 
the strategic partnership with Microsoft can be found on page 18 and 19. 

In accordance with the terms of the Relationship Agreement, Erin Brown, 
representative of Thomson Reuters, stepped down from the Board  
on 17 March 2023, and Doug Steenland, representative of Blackstone, 
stepped down from the Board on 20 September 2023. On behalf  
of the Board, I would like to thank Erin and Doug for the significant 
contributions they made since the acquisition of Refinitiv in January 2021.

On 14 September 2023, William Vereker took over from Cressida Hogg 
as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. Cressida Hogg continues  
to serve as Senior Independent Director and a member of the 
Remuneration Committee. I would like to thank Cressida for her 
contribution as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 

On 20 November 2023, the Group announced that it had appointed 
Michel-Alain Proch as CFO and Executive Director from 1 March 2024. 
This followed the announcement in May 2023 that Anna Manz would 
step down from the Board as CFO and Executive Director. I would like  
to thank Anna for the key role she has played in the successful delivery 
of the Group’s strategy over the last three years, and I am happy to 
welcome Michel-Alain to the Board.

The Board continues to seek opportunities to refresh the key skills and 
experience and to enhance the effectiveness of the Board, while having 
regard to board diversity. The Board believes that diversity of thought, 
experience and background makes us more dynamic, fosters innovation 
and boosts performance. The Board seeks to comply with Listing Rule 
9.8.6(9) on gender and ethnic diversity. I am pleased to confirm that  
we meet the Parker Review recommendations, and that we meet all 
recommendations set out by the FTSE Women Leaders Review. Two of 
the four senior positions in the Company outlined in the Listing Rules  
are currently held by women and two of the Board’s Directors are from  
a minority ethnic background. At the end of 2023, the Board was over 
40% female, however, following Anna’s departure and Michel-Alain’s 
arrival, this will drop to below 40%. For more information on Board 
diversity and the process followed in relation to Board appointments, 
please see the Nomination Committee report on pages 106 to 108.

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018  
(the “Code”) 
The Company has complied with the principles of the Code throughout 
the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and to the date of this 
report, and complied with all provisions of the Code, except for provision 
32. Provision 32 of the Code states that the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee should have served on a remuneration committee for at least 
12 months before becoming chair. William Vereker was appointed as 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee having served for over 11 months 
on the Committee. The decision to appoint William as Committee Chair 
shortly before 12 months on the Committee was taken in order to allow 
William to lead on the proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy, 
including consultation with shareholders. Further information on 
compliance with the Code is detailed on page 105. 

This report is intended to give shareholders a clear and comprehensive 
picture of the Group’s governance arrangements and how they 
operated during the year. Pages 98 to 105 set out details of the areas  
of our focus during the year, followed by the Committee reports. 

Conclusion 
I hope you find this report helpful and informative in understanding 
governance at LSEG. I encourage all shareholders to vote their shares in 
favour of all resolutions to be considered at our AGM in April 2024, even 
if you are unable to attend in person. Details of the AGM will be included 
in the Notice of Meeting. 

Don Robert
Chair
28 February 2024

Corporate governance introduction continued

Remuneration Policy 
Our proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be put to shareholders 
for approval at the 2024 AGM. The proposed changes are focused  
on updating our policy to ensure that it remains appropriate for  
our transformed business. Details of the proposed policy and the 
implementation of the current policy during the year, can be found  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 117 to 153. 

Board effectiveness review 
This year’s effectiveness review was conducted by the Group Company 
Secretary using a detailed questionnaire provided with the aid of an 
external provider, Lintstock. Results and agreed areas of focus for  
the Board are described on page 102 and 103. The Board will ensure 
that these focus areas are acted upon to further improve Board 
performance. I can confirm that the actions from the 2022 effectiveness 
review have been completed.

Board site visits and workforce engagement 
Opportunities to visit our operations globally, engage directly with the 
workforce and learn about the business continue to be very important 
and valuable for the Board. During the year, the Board visited the Paris 
office and met with colleagues to hear more about their areas of the 
business and provided a forum for colleagues to share their views with 
the Board. Further information on workforce engagement can be found 
on page 71. 

The Board also engaged with the workforce virtually through a series  
of Board conversations in key regional locations. These meetings were 
designed to increase Board members’ visibility with the workforce, gain 
real insights into the Group’s culture and any concerns from colleagues 
at different levels of the business and have meaningful, two-way 
dialogue with the workforce. This was particularly important in 2023 as 
we continued with the integration of the Refinitiv business, progressed 
the partnership with Microsoft and embedded the Company’s culture 
and new values across the Group. More information of the Company’s 
culture and values can be found on page 60. The feedback that Board 
members received from this direct engagement was shared with the 
wider Board at the following meeting and the Board has encouraged 
management to respond to feedback and to take appropriate action. 
Further information can be found on pages 71 and 72. 

Committee governance 
The Chairs of the Audit Committee, Risk Committee, Nomination 
Committee and Remuneration Committee report on the activities of  
each of the Committees during the year. I would like to thank the 
Committee Chairs for the work they have done during the year,  
including attending the AGM to meet with shareholders. 

Sustainability
As described in the Sustainability section of the Strategic Report  
(pages 58 to 68), LSEG has many initiatives in place to deliver our 
commitment to be a strategic enabler of sustainable economic growth. 
Given our central role in capital markets, our global footprint and 
presence throughout the trade lifecycle, LSEG is uniquely positioned  
to play a leading role in this respect.

LSEG’s role in sustainability, and tackling climate change in particular,  
is very important to the Board, as well as the Group’s shareholders, 
employees, customers and regulators. The Board is committed to 
meeting the expectations of our shareholders and stakeholders in  
this regard.

Corporate governance report

Board responsibilities 
The LSEG Board is collectively responsible for the long-term, 
sustainable success of the Company, the delivery of sustainable value  
to its shareholders and contributing to wider society. 

The Board: 
 — provides leadership of the Company and is responsible for setting  

the strategy and maintaining high standards of governance; 

 — leads the development of the Group’s culture, values and behaviours;
 — oversees the execution of the Group’s strategy and holds executive 

management to account for its delivery; 

 — ensures necessary resources are in place for the Group to be able  
to meet its objectives and measures performance against these.  
This includes the establishment of a framework of prudent and 
effective controls, which enable risk to be assessed and managed; 
 — reviews and holds management to account for financial and business 

performance; and 

 — ensures that its responsibilities to shareholders and stakeholders  
are met, including through effective engagement. This includes 
having workforce policies and practices that are consistent with  
the Company’s values and support the Company’s long-term 
sustainable success.

In carrying out their duties, the Directors act in accordance with all 
relevant and applicable legislative and regulatory rules. In particular, 
they take into account Directors’ duties contained in the Companies Act 
2006 (the “Act”) and will consider the factors listed in Section 172 of the 
Act and any other relevant factors. 

LSEG’s Section 172(1) statement for the year ended 31 December 2023, 
including details of certain Board decisions taken during the year,  
can be found on pages 75 to 78 of the Strategic Report. 

The Directors have full access to the advice and services of the Group 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising on corporate 
governance matters. 

Board Committees 
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities to four Board 
Committees: the Audit, Nomination, Remuneration and Risk Committees. 
Full details of the Committees’ responsibilities are set out in individual 
terms of reference which are available on the corporate website.  
The work undertaken by each Committee during the financial year is 
detailed within the respective Committee reports on pages 106 to 123.

Board composition
As at the date of this report, the Board is composed of 12 members:  
the Chairman, seven independent Non-Executive Directors, two 
Non-Executive Directors (the Shareholder-appointed Director1 and the 
Director appointed in connection with the strategic partnership with 
Microsoft2), and two Executive Directors. Five of the Directors are 
women; two of the Directors are from a minority ethnic background; and 
two senior positions are held by female Directors (Senior Independent 
Director and Chief Financial Officer). The Board Diversity Policy, which  
is reviewed annually, is available on the corporate website: https://www.
lseg.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance. The Board’s statement of 
division of responsibilities can also be found on this web page.

Stakeholder engagement 
The Board seeks to understand the interests, needs and concerns  
of shareholders and other key stakeholders (including customers, the 
workforce and regulators) to enable the Company to pursue long-term 
sustainable success. For more information on how we engage with our 
stakeholders as well as how the Board has discharged its duties under 
Section 172 of the Companies Act, please see pages 69 to 78 of the 
Strategic Report. 

Relations with shareholders 
We believe that regular and ongoing engagement with our key 
stakeholders and, in particular, our shareholders is central to good 
corporate governance. The Group’s Investor Relations (IR) function, 
reporting to the Chief Financial Officer, manages a shareholder 
engagement programme throughout the year.

The Chair, Senior Independent Director and Chairs of each Board 
Committee are available to engage with major investors, typically to 
discuss corporate governance matters. In 2023, the Chair engaged  
with shareholders on matters including sustainability, remuneration  
and Board composition, as well as performance against the Company’s 
strategy. The Chair of the Remuneration Committee consulted with 
major shareholders and proxy voting agencies to understand their  
views on the proposed approach for our Remuneration Policy and key 
executive remuneration decisions. Further details and the outcome of 
this engagement are included within the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
from page 117. 

Senior management and the Investor Relations (IR) team engage with 
investors to discuss strategy, performance, sustainability and other 
matters. We continued to ramp-up investor engagement in 2023  
and demand for the stock proved to be strong, with the Blackstone 
consortium executing three successful share placings during the course 
of the year, each of which was significantly oversubscribed. In total,  
the former Refinitiv owners successfully placed over £6 billion worth of 
LSEG stock in 2023. Across the year, we held over 470 engagements 
with institutional equity and debt investors (significantly higher than the 
FTSE 100 average), with interest primarily from the UK and USA but  
with increasing interest from countries such as Canada and Australia  
as we look to broaden our outreach more globally. Senior executive 
management and the IR team took part in 9 conferences this year, 
across the US, Canada, the UK and Continental Europe, hosted by 
banks or industry organisations.

As well as expanding our conference schedule, we also ran a number  
of roadshows with executive management both internationally and in  
the UK as we continued to step up our efforts to explain our investment 
case and strategy to a wider range of prospective global investors.  
We achieved broad coverage of our existing register, meeting with  
over 85% of our active shareholder base. 

In 2022, we ran a comprehensive investor perception study through our 
external advisers, Makinson Cowell. One of the key pieces of feedback 
from that study was that investors expressed a desire for more deep 
dives into the various businesses that make up the Group and to hear 
more often from divisional management. In 2023, we held a landmark 
two-day Capital Markets Event, at which we welcomed more than 90 
institutional investors and sell-side analysts to our London headquarters. 
Hundreds more watched the plenary presentations via a live webcast. 
The guests were invited to hear presentations from our CEO, CFO, Head 
of Data & Analytics and Head of Sales & Account Management, as well 
as to take part in Q&A sessions with management teams from across 
our business in break-out sessions. Feedback on the event was very 
positive. From those who provided feedback scores, 92% of attendees 
said they found the event useful. In addition, 90% of attendees said they 
now think of LSEG more as an information services company than an 
exchange, representing the shift in LSEG’s market perception since the 
acquisition of Refinitiv.

The Board receives a report on IR matters at each of its scheduled 
meetings, including feedback from investors, market expectations  
of financial performance and updates on share register composition. 
Sell-side analyst research notes on LSEG are regularly circulated 
through the business, including to the Board and senior executives. The 
Group’s corporate brokers also provide the Board with advice on market

Workforce engagement 
The Board believes that having a diverse workforce makes us more 
dynamic, fosters innovation and boosts performance. The Board 
continues to support the goals for senior leadership set by management 
which include goals for ethnic diversity and gender diversity. The Board 
regularly tracks progress against these through Equity, Diversity & 
Inclusion. Further information on Equity, Diversity & Inclusion can  
be found in our Sustainability section on page 61. 

Matters considered by the Board 
Each of the regular meetings includes a wide-ranging report from the 
Chief Executive Officer, together with reports from the Chief Financial 
Officer on the Group’s financial performance and the Chief Operating 
Officer on the continued progress of the Refinitiv integration programme, 
the Group’s transformation programme and Group operations. Reports 
from the Committee Chairs and updates on major projects were also 
provided at each Board meeting. 

Information on workforce engagement can be found in the Stakeholder 
Engagement section on pages 71 and 72. The Board believes that the 
direct and indirect engagement it undertakes with the workforce, as well 
as the range of engagement activities that it has undertaken during the 
year, as described in the stakeholder engagement section, are effective 
and have facilitated meaningful, two-way dialogue between the Board 
and employees. The forms of engagement undertaken during the year 
have enabled the Board to hear from a broad range of our workforce 
across our regions and at different levels of seniority and role type, 
given the size and global footprint of the Group. 

Board independence 
The Board has evaluated the independence of all the Non-Executive 
Directors. In assessing each Director, the Board considers whether there 
are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect or could 
appear to affect a Director’s judgement. 

Martin Brand was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director  
in 2021. Martin represents Blackstone in accordance with the terms of 
the Relationship Agreement, which is considered to be a significant 
shareholder of LSEG.

Scott Guthrie was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director 
with effect from 1 February 2023. Scott represents Microsoft Corporation 
and was appointed in connection with the strategic partnership  
(for further information please see pages 18 and 19). 

The Board agreed that Martin and Scott would not be considered 
independent under the Code given their relationships with Blackstone 
and Microsoft respectively. They are not members of the Audit, 
Remuneration or Risk Committees. 

The Board has evaluated the independence of the other Non-Executive 
Directors and concluded that each are independent in character and 
judgement. The Chair was independent on appointment. 

In line with the Code, at least half the Board, excluding the Chair,  
are independent Non-Executive Directors. All Directors are subject  
to annual re-election at the Company’s AGM. 

During the year, the key matters considered by the Board included  
the following: 

Customers
 — Customer matters, including meetings with customers and key 

account executives during the Board visit to Paris. This included  
deep dives on key customer relationships; FX strategy; and the 
development of product solutions to meet customer needs.

 — Reviews of new products and services, including the non-deliverable 
forward product, the Group’s first global FX trading venue launched

In 2023, it participated in a number of sessions relating to the strategic 
partnership with Microsoft, a number of the Group’s businesses and key

focused sessions on trading and banking in EMEA, Capital Markets  
in Europe and technology operations in Europe. It also held training 
sessions on UK Market Abuse Regulations and the Listing Rules. 

Chairs’ Forum 
The Chairs’ Forum is composed of the Chairs of the Group’s principal 
regulated subsidiaries and the Group Chair, with the Group CEO  
being invited to meetings on a regular basis. The Forum provides 
opportunities for relevant subsidiary Chairs from across the Group  
to engage on common themes and topics of interest. During the year,  
this included: strategic matters, regulatory matters, succession planning, 
customers, technology and migration to the cloud and capital allocation.

Board effectiveness and leadership 
A Board effectiveness review is carried out annually in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), with a review being externally 
facilitated every three years.

2022 Effectiveness Review
The 2022 Effectiveness Review was facilitated externally and identified areas where the Board considered further focus would be needed during 
2023. These are summarised below, together with the resulting actions taken in 2023.

Area

Gain further understanding of certain areas, 
including teach-ins on each Division of the  
Group, moving to the cloud and acquisitions 

The Board participated in a number of deep dive sessions which were focused  
on enhancing their understanding in the key areas flagged in the previous review. 

Board, 
executives, 
and deeper 
relationships

Board 
composition 
and 
succession 
planning

Stakeholders

Deepen the Board relationship with the  
Executive Committee

Board to consider the priorities for  
future composition

Board to identify further opportunities to engage 
with shareholders, including their views on LSEG 
and growth; and customers, including a deeper 
understanding of customer needs and the data 
that is most valuable to them

The Board continued efforts to deepen its relationship with the Executive Committee 
throughout the year both on a group and individual basis. This included attendance 
by an Executive Committee member at each Board meeting and inviting members of 
the Executive Committee to join the Board’s visit to the Paris office. 

The Board also met with Erica Bourne, Satvinder Singh and Ron Lefferts following 
their appointments to the Executive Committee, and notably, all presented at Board 
meetings during 2023 and at the Board strategy day.

As reported in its Report on pages 106 to 107, the Nomination Committee continued 
to monitor succession planning to ensure an appropriate schedule is in place to 
effectively manage future Board composition. During the year, the Committee 
recommended, and the Board approved, the appointment of Michel-Alain Proch as 
Group CFO and Executive Director. Michel-Alain joined LSEG on 26 February 2024 
and becomes CFO and Executive Director on 1 March 2024. For more information, 
please see the Nomination Committee report on pages 106 to 108. 

The Board engaged with various stakeholders during 2023, including customers, 
employees and regulators. Further information on this can be found in the Board 
engagement with stakeholders section on pages 69 to 74. 

2023 Effectiveness Review 
In 2023, the Board undertook an internal evaluation of the performance 
of the Board, its Committees, the Chair and the individual Directors.  
The evaluation process was conducted by the Group Company 
Secretary using a detailed questionnaire provided by an external 
provider, Lintstock. 

The 2023 effectiveness review sought the views of Directors on the 
effectiveness of the organisation and dynamics of the Board and  
its Committees, the papers and topics covered at the Board and 
Committee meetings, the purpose and culture of the business, 
stakeholder engagement, the relationship between the Non-Executive 
Directors and management, the current and future composition of  
the Board, the oversight of risk management and internal controls,  
and the leadership of the Board.

The outputs of the evaluation were reported to, and considered by,  
the Board and actions and focus areas for the Board and its Committees 
to undertake in 2024 were agreed.

As part of the 2023 effectiveness review, the Senior Independent 
Director led a review of the performance of the Chair, using a similar 
form of questionnaire provided by Lintstock. The Chair meets with 
Directors individually to discuss their performance.

The results of the effectiveness review will also be used to assist  
in the future development of the Board, its Committees and its  
individual Directors.

Results 
The 2023 effectiveness review identified a number of positive  
attributes including:
 — Board composition and dynamics – current Board composition  

and the relationships between the Non-Executive Directors and the 
Executive Directors.

 — Stakeholder oversight – the Board noted a significant improvement 

in shareholder and investor oversight. 

 — Employee sentiment/culture – Board employee engagement 

sessions were well received.

 — Board support – quality of Board governance and Board support was 

highly rated. 

 — Strategic and operational oversight – the Board noted the improved 

oversight in these areas. 

 — Risk management and internal control – rated positively overall, 
however future areas of focus were identified (see next steps for 
further information). 

Overall, the review found that the Board and its Committees are 
performing well and are effective. The results indicated that the Board 
considers that it has the appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge to enable it and its Committees to 
discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.

Next steps 
The Board agreed that areas of focus for 2024 should be:
 — Board Composition and Dynamics – to build on relationships 

between the Non-Executive Directors and the wider executive team 
particularly in the light of changes to the executive team.

 — Stakeholder Oversight – having benefited from the time spent during 

the year focusing on customers, the Board will seek to further 
increase this in 2024.

 — Strategic Oversight – the Board identified the following areas in 

which focused time should be spent on furthering its understanding 
and oversight capability:
 — Technology, particularly technological change and the  

D&A strategy;

 — Delivery of the Microsoft Partnership and product development;
 — External insights, particularly competitive dynamics; and
 — Organisational capacity to deliver the strategy and continued  
focus on the development of internal talent and pool of future 
succession candidates.

 — Risk Management and Operational Resilience – Oversight of 

operational resilience will remain a key priority for the Board in 2024 
which is seen as important for delivery of the Group’s ambitions and 
for our customers.

The results of the effectiveness reviews of the Committees were 
positive about the management and composition of the Committees  
as well as the quality of the information received. 

Committee 2024 areas of focus 
Audit Committee
 — Additional support and education in relation to sustainability  

and in the business areas and associated risks.

 — Ensuring a smooth transition of the external auditor from EY  

to Deloitte. 

Nomination Committee
 — Continued focus on Board and Executive Committee succession.
 — Performance and development of the Executive Committee.
 — Broader focus on talent management across the Group.

Remuneration Committee
 — Effectively delivering the new remuneration policy.

Risk Committee
 — Provide further support and education around technology matters.
 — Continued focus on operational risk management and further 

improving resiliency.

Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association allow the Board to authorise 
conflicts of interest that may arise and to impose such limits or 
conditions as it thinks fit. The Group has established procedures 
whereby actual and potential conflicts of interest are regularly reviewed, 
appropriate authorisation is sought prior to the appointment of any  
new Director, and new conflicts are addressed appropriately. 

The decision to authorise a conflict of interest can only be made by 
non-conflicted Directors and, in making such decisions, the Directors 
must act in a way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to 
promote the Company’s success. 

Indemnities 
Directors have the benefit of indemnity arrangements from the  
Company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office and 
execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities. The Company 
maintained a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance policy throughout 
the year. This policy covers the Directors for any such liabilities in 
respect of which they are not indemnified by the Company and,  
to the extent to which it has indemnified the Directors, also covers the 
Company. Neither the Company’s indemnity nor insurance provides 
cover for a Director in the event that the Director is proved to have 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly.

Risk management and internal control 
The Board is responsible for ensuring the Group’s risk management 
framework and internal control system is maintained and remains 
effective. This covers all material controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls. The Risk Management Framework prescribes 
the extent of the principal risks the Group is willing to take to achieve its 
long-term strategy. The internal control system safeguards the quality 
and integrity of internal and external financial reporting as well as 
operational, legal and regulatory compliance. 

The system of internal controls is designed to facilitate the management 
of the Group’s activities within the Board’s risk appetite. Rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s objectives, the system 
of internal controls can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material control failures. The Board is committed to 
maintaining a robust internal control system, with a view to continuously 
maturing, embedding and optimising enhanced risk management 
practices throughout the Group.

The Board delegates some of its responsibilities to the Audit Committee 
and Risk Committee.

The Audit Committee regularly works alongside the Risk Committee  
to monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
control systems and risk management systems. The Audit Committee 
also monitors the effectiveness and objectivity of internal and external 
auditors. The Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board on its 
activities. In 2023, the Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s continued 
work to further enhance and mature the internal controls environment, 
despite the withdrawal of some proposals under the Government’s 
planned Audit and Corporate Governance reforms. Further details on 
the activities of the Audit Committee can be found on pages 109 to 114.

The Risk Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities  
by advising on risk strategy and overseeing the development, 
implementation and maintenance of the Group’s Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework (ERMF) and the Group Risk Appetite statement. 
The Risk Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities. 
Further details on the activities of the Risk Committee can be found  
on pages 115 and 116.

A summary of some of the Group’s Risk Management Frameworks and 
internal controls are listed below:

Enterprise Risk Management Framework
The Board annually approves the Group’s ERMF. The ERMF sets out  
a standard approach for managing risk across the Group. It ensures that 
all risks are adequately understood and managed within risk appetite 
across all levels of the Group. During 2023, the Risk Committee 
reviewed the ERMF to identify areas of optimisation to further enhance 
the maturity of the Group’s enterprise risk management. Further details 
on the ERMF can be found in the principal risks and uncertainties 
section from page 79.

Risk Appetite Statement
The Board approves the Group Risk Appetite Statement which outlines 
the key concepts of risk appetite and risk tolerance that the Group will 
accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives. It is determined in line  
with the Group’s strategy. The Group Risk Appetite Statement allows 
management to understand the potential risks associated with strategic 
and operational decisions; assess whether the risk return on capital is 
acceptable; and put in place mitigating actions to reduce risk exposure 
to acceptable levels. It maintains the correct balance between risks and 
rewards, thus ensuring the Group remains more resilient by taking better 
informed decisions.

Further details on the Internal Audit function can be found in  
the internal audit charter which is available on the Group’s website  
at https://www.lseg.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance

Policy Governance Framework
The Group is committed to operating within a robust control 
environment. LSEG has a Policy Governance Framework (PGF) which 
details the internal governance for all Group policies. The PGF outlines 
the development, maintenance, implementation and compliance of all 
Group policies. It details how various risks within Group policies are 
addressed and ensures all Group policies comply with the PGF. 

Management Structure/Delegation of Authority
The Group operates a matrix structure designed to optimise resource 
allocation and organisational capacity. Subject to the Schedule of 
Matters Reserved for the Board, the Board has delegated the day-to-day 
running of the Group to the CEO. The CEO is supported by the Group 
Executive Committee (ExCo), which is designed to ensure open 
challenge and support effective decision-making. Each ExCo member  
is accountable for a key operating division, business area or function.

The ExCo meets regularly to assist the CEO in exercising his authority 
over material matters that have strategic, cross-business area or 
Group-wide implications. Delegation from the Board requires ExCo 
members to maintain responsibility and sustain a control environment 
that is appropriate to their division, business area or function.

The ExCo has established subcommittees: the Financial, Investment  
& Capital Committee (FICC); and the Executive Risk Committee (ERC). 
The remit of the FICC is wide ranging and includes: reviewing the 
financial and legal implications of Group contracts; approving changes 
to the Group’s corporate structure; an annual review of the Group’s 
overall tax governance policy; and monitoring of the Group’s intragroup 
lending arrangements. The ERC oversees matters such as risk culture, 
risk profile oversight, risk policy oversight, risk appetite and risk 
disclosures and reporting.

The Board is satisfied that the operation and effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal controls throughout 2023 and until the date 
of approval of the Annual Report, are sufficiently robust. A thorough 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance and liquidity, 
have been carried out during the year. Necessary actions have been  
or are being taken to remedy any control issues identified during these 
reviews. The Board concluded that the Group’s risk management 
systems are sufficient given the Group’s risk profile, risk appetite and 
long-term strategic objectives. The Board will continue to consider 
further enhancements to its risk management and internal control 
system, to ensure it complies with regulatory and legal developments 
and changes to the external environment.

Further information
Further detail on the Group’s risk management and an overview of the 
principal risks and uncertainties (including a summary of emerging risks) 
of the Group is provided on pages 79 to 88.

Financial Control Framework
LSEG has established a Financial Control Framework (FCF) that sets out 
to develop and maintain a robust financial control environment, that 
mitigates the risk of material financial misstatement, and helps protect 
the Group against financial fraud. The FCF aims to ensure clear links 
between the Group’s financial reporting risks and the associated 
processes and control environment, making sure these are tested  
and appropriately documented. The FCF is also focused on ensuring 
the right culture and training is in place to support a risk-first mindset. 
The Audit Committee receives regular updates on the progress being 
made to enhance the FCF.

Financial reporting controls
Ahead of each reporting period end, the Group’s financial reporting 
process is facilitated using accounting policies and reporting formats 
and is supported by guidance issued to all reporting entities within  
the Group. Management is responsible for maintaining the control 
environment for financial reporting and ensuring policies and 
procedures exist around the maintenance of records. The submission  
of financial reports from each reporting entity is subject to a rigorous 
review. Management must provide assurance regarding the reliability 
and accuracy of the Group’s financial reports. The Audit Committee 
reviews the application of the Group’s accounting policies as well as 
significant accounting judgements and estimates. It also reviews the 
externally reported interim and full-year results and satisfies itself that 
these are fair, balanced and understandable.

Internal Audit
The Board, together with the Audit Committee, is responsible for 
ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the Internal Audit 
function. Internal Audit’s primary function is to provide independent and 
objective assurance to the: Board; Audit Committee; and executive 
management on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal controls. The Internal Audit function provides opinion and 
challenge on the control environment and provides assurance on the 
Group’s ERMF. Internal Audit provides an opinion on the adequacy  
and effectiveness of the Group’s framework of governance, risk 
management and controls on an annual basis. This is achieved through 
a programme of assurance over key risks applicable to the Group and 
audits required by regulation. To ensure independence, the Internal 
Audit function sits within the third line of defence in the Group’s risk 
control structure and has no operational responsibilities for the legal 
entities or processes which it reviews.

The independence of the Internal Audit function from executive 
management is protected by the following measures:
 — The Chief Internal Auditor reports directly to the Chair of the  

Audit Committee and has direct access to the Chair of the Board.  
For administrative matters she has a secondary reporting line to  
the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

 — The Chair of the Audit Committee and CEO jointly assess the 

performance of the Chief Internal Auditor.

 — The Audit Committee approves the Internal Audit Charter and  

annual budget.

Throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and to the date of this report, London Stock Exchange Group plc has complied with all

that William was suitably qualified to take on the role of Remuneration Committee Chair and to oversee the review of the Remuneration Policy.  
The decision to appoint William as Committee Chair shortly before 12 months of experience on a remuneration committee was taken to allow  
William to lead the Committee on the proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy, including consultation with shareholders. He is supported 
 in his role by the other Committee members, including Cressida Hogg, the previous Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 

The Code is publicly available at the website of the UK Financial Reporting Council at www.frc.org.uk. Details of how the principles of the Code

Report of the  
Nomination Committee

Key areas of focus for the 
Committee in the year were  
Board composition, succession 
planning and the appointment  
of Michel-Alain Proch as Chief 
Financial Officer and Executive 
Director. This report describes  
the work of the Committee.

Don Robert 
Chair of the Nomination Committee

Achievements for 2023
The priorities set by the Committee at the start of the year were: 
1.  Continue to ensure a diverse talent pipeline.
2.  Review succession plans for Non-Executive Directors to ensure that 
future changes are appropriately managed to avoid a significant 
number of changes in quick succession.

3.  Continue to keep Executive Committee succession planning  

under review.

Composition and meetings
The Committee’s membership is composed of all the Non-Executive 
Directors. Structuring the membership in this way enables Non-
Executive Directors to participate in all discussions relating to Board 
composition and succession planning, reflecting the importance  
placed by both LSEG and the Code on these areas. The names and 
biographies of the Non-Executive Directors who sit on this Committee 
can be found on pages 94 to 97 of this report.

The Group Company Secretary is the Secretary to the Committee  
and attends all meetings. The Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO),  
Chief People Officer and external advisers attend where requested by 
the Committee.

Committee purpose and responsibilities
The Nomination Committee is responsible for monitoring the balance of 
skills, knowledge and experience as well as the diversity of the Board.  
It is also responsible for making recommendations of new appointments 
to the Board and overseeing Board and senior management succession 
planning. Further details on the responsibilities of the Nomination 
Committee can be found in the Committee’s terms of reference  
which are reviewed annually and available on the Group’s website at: 
https://www.lseg.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance.

The Committee met four times during the year and, in addition, 
Committee members also met with Director and senior management 
candidates. I am pleased to confirm that the Committee’s priorities  
have been met, as described in this report.

Key activities in the year
Board succession planning and Board appointments
The Board recognises the need to regularly refresh the balance of skills, 
tenure and diversity on the Board. During the year, the Committee 
reviewed the structure, size and composition of the Board and its 
Committees, to ensure critical skills and experience were refreshed.  
In carrying out its review, the Committee took account of recent and 
likely future Board changes, Board expertise, diversity and tenure.  
This review helped the Committee to identify Board succession 
requirements. Appointments to the Board are subject to a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure.

Following the announcement on 25 May 2023 that Anna Manz  
would step down from the Board as CFO and Executive Director, the 
Nomination Committee approved the appointment of Russell Reynolds, 
an external search consultancy which is a signatory to the Enhanced 
Voluntary Code of Conduct for executive search firms, to assist in the 
search for a new CFO and Executive Director. The Committee approved 
an outline brief and role specification and Russell Reynolds was 
instructed to produce a diverse list of candidates for consideration.

David Schwimmer provided regular updates to the Board and the 
Committee on the progress of the search. Shortlisted candidates were 
interviewed by the CEO, the Chair and members of the Executive 
Committee. The final two preferred candidates met with Cressida Hogg, 
Dominic Blakemore and William Vereker, the Senior Independent 
Director, Chair of Audit Committee and Chair of Remuneration 
Committee, respectively. Other members of the Nomination Committee 
were also then invited to meet with the preferred candidate. Following 
this interview process, the Nomination Committee recommended, and 
the Board approved, the appointment of Michel-Alain Proch as CFO and 
Executive Director. Michel-Alain joined the Group on 26 February 2024 
and will become CFO and Executive Director with effect from 1 March 
2024. Michel-Alain brings deep experience across global, financial 
infrastructure and IT data solutions firms. He was previously CFO for 
Publicis Groupe SA where he led the global finance team across 100 
countries. Prior to this, he held several listed company CFO positions, 
including at Ingenico and Atos, where he was also CEO, North America 
and Group Chief Digital Officer. Michael-Alain serves as Vice-Chairman 
of the Board, Maisons du Monde and Non-Executive Director of Pluxee.

As disclosed in last year’s Nomination Committee report, the Company 
announced a 10-year strategic partnership with Microsoft and that  
as part of the partnership Scott Guthrie, Microsoft’s Executive Vice 
President, Cloud and AI Group, joined the Board on 1 February 2023. 
Scott’s appointment was approved by shareholders at the AGM in April 
2023. In accordance with the terms of the Relationship Agreement,  
Erin Brown, representative of Thomson Reuters, stepped down from  
the Board on 17 March 2023, and Doug Steenland, representative of 
Blackstone, stepped down from the Board on 20 September 2023.  
The Board thanks Erin and Doug for their contribution to the Board  
since the acquisition of Refinitiv in 2021.

Senior management appointments
During the year, the Committee met with the CEO and Chief People 
Officer to review succession plans and the pipeline for successions  
for executive management including consideration of diversity.  
As described on page 14 there were a number of changes to the 
Executive Committee during the year and the Board Chair, Don Robert, 
participated in the interview and selection process as well as other 
Committee members as appropriate. The Committee continues to 
support the CEO in executive succession planning, for emergency cover 
and longer-term appointments and the Committee regularly challenges 
the CEO on diversity and inclusion in regard to senior management 
succession planning.

The Group Executive Committee is formed of individuals from a diverse 
range of backgrounds. As at 31 December 2023, 38% of the Executive 
Committee members were female and 15% were from an ethnic minority 
background. The names and biographies for the Group Executive 
Committee can be found on page 15 of this report. 

The Group is committed to seeking broader diversity in our leadership 
with the aim of having more representation from different ethnic and 
other backgrounds at Executive and Group Leader level. With respect  
to under-represented ethnic and racial groups, we did not achieve our 
goal to reach 20% within the leadership community by the end of 2023, 
closing the year at 14%. We remain focused on making progress through 
leadership development programmes for underrepresented talent. For 
more information on the actions we are taking, refer to page 26 of our 
2023 Sustainability Report.

Time commitment
The Committee reviews the time commitments of the Directors and 
approves any significant external appointments being undertaken by  
the Directors. During the year, the Committee reviewed the additional 
external appointments of Anna Manz and Ashok Vaswani. The 
Committee and/or the Board agreed that the proposed appointments  
at AstraZeneca PLC and Kotak Mahindra Bank, respectively, would  
not create any material conflict of interest. Both Directors were 
simultaneously giving up an existing Board position so their overall 
number of directorships would remain the same. They were therefore 
able to confirm that they would have sufficient time to undertake these 
new roles in addition to existing commitments.

Board effectiveness
The results of the 2023 Board effectiveness review are described on 
pages 102 and 103. Ensuring the skills and experience on the Board 
were of the appropriate mix was a key area of focus for 2023, and this  
is reflected in the work of the Nomination Committee. This year’s results 
and agreed areas of focus for the Board are described on pages 102 
and 103. The Board will ensure that these focus areas are acted on to 
further improve Board performance.

Diversity & Inclusion
The Board’s membership reflects a wide range of skills and business 
experience, drawn from a number of industries, which is critical for 
bringing the expertise required and for enabling different perspectives 
to be brought to Board discussions. The combination of these factors 
means that the Board benefits from a diverse range of competencies, 
perspectives and thoughts, providing an ability to challenge on strategic 
issues and a dynamic environment for decision-making.

The Board reviewed and approved its Board Diversity Policy which 
outlines the importance of diversity of gender, social and ethnic 
backgrounds, and of cognitive and personal strengths to the Board.  
The Policy is available on the Group website at https:// www.lseg.com/
en/about-us/corporate-governance. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Board met all of the targets set out in the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rule 9.8.6R(9)(a). The table overleaf 
sets out the diversity data of the Board and executive management as at 
31 December 2023.

Ethnicity data reflects countries where LSEG collects this information.
1  Defined as the Executive Committee and the Company Secretary in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10).
2  Rounded percentages sum to 99%. To 1 decimal place, percentages would be 83.3%, 8.3% and 8.3%.

Board diversity data is collected directly from each Director using  
a questionnaire and was provided on a self-identifying basis. 

At the end of 2023, female representation on the Board was 42%.  
The Board is also pleased to confirm that it has met the Parker Review 
recommendations and included two Directors from minority ethnic 
backgrounds. Throughout 2023, two of the four senior positions on the 
Board were held by women. Following the resignation of Anna Manz 
and the appointment of Michel-Alain Proch, female representation will 
be below 40%. The Board will continue to seek to ensure that these 
goals are met in the longer term.

Appointments and succession plans are based on merit and objective 
criteria. Other than appointments covered under the Relationship 
Agreement and the partnership with Microsoft, the Company uses 
external search consultancies when making appointments to key 
positions. These firms are required to provide a diverse list of 
candidates for senior roles. In particular, the Board’s succession and 
appointment approach aims to secure balanced and diverse shortlists 
for new appointments.

The Group was an early signatory of HM Treasury’s Women in Finance 
Charter in the UK and met the stretch goal of reaching 40% female 
representation in our senior leadership population by the end of 2022. 
We have also made progress during the year on improving gender 
diversity within the subsidiary companies of the Group, which has 
increased to 32% (2022: 25%). 

In 2023 we developed an enhanced methodology to help us review our 
equity, diversity and inclusion goals to ensure they remain relevant and 
appropriate, and have used this to set new goals for 2024 and beyond:
 — Gender: maintain at least 40% of women in senior leadership  

(ExCo and Group Leaders) going forward 

 — Ethnicity: 25% underrepresented ethnic groups in senior leadership 

roles (ExCo and Group Leaders) by 2027.

LSEG is a member of the Valuable 500, a collective of 500 CEOs and 
their companies, innovating together for disability inclusion. For further 
information on senior leadership gender and ethnicity representation 
please see our Sustainability section on page 61.

Priorities for 2024
The priorities set by the Committee for 2024 are:
1. Continue to ensure a diverse talent pipeline.
2.  Review succession plans for Non-Executive Directors to ensure that 

future changes are appropriately managed to avoid several Directors 
stepping down in quick succession.

3.  Continue to keep Executive Committee succession planning  

under review.

Committee effectiveness
The Committee’s effectiveness was assessed as part of the 2023  
Board and Committee effectiveness review, facilitated internally via  
a questionnaire provided by Lintstock. Further details can be found in the 
Governance section of this report on page 102. The result of the review 
was that the Committee is performing well and operating effectively.

A key focus for the Audit 
Committee this year was the 
changing regulatory and corporate 
governance landscape. The 
enhancements to the Group’s 
financial control framework,  
and the plans around sustainability 
assurance, were therefore 
important topics during the year.

Dominic Blakemore
Chair of the Audit Committee

Achievements for 2023
The main achievements of the Audit Committee in 2023 were:
 — reviewing and recommending to the Board the full-year and half-year 

2023 results and approving the associated key accounting 
judgements and estimates;

 — reviewing and approving our Annual Report and Accounts;
 — oversight of the 2023 external audit;
 — monitoring and reviewing several financial matters including 

acquisitions and the progress of specific uncertain tax provisions;
 — reviewing the progress against the plan to create a leading financial 

control framework; 

 — reviewing the broader landscape for sustainability and climate risk 

reporting as well as Audit and Corporate Governance Reform and the 
Group’s plans for ensuring it remains compliant with future changes to 
the reporting requirements; 

 — the completion of the audit tender process and decision to appoint 

Deloitte LLP as the Group’s new external auditor; and

 — oversight of the progress of the transition to the new external auditor.

Committee role and responsibilities 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing and monitoring 
financial reporting (including climate-related financial disclosures), 
internal controls systems and risk management systems. 

The key responsibilities of the Committee are: 
 — monitoring the integrity of the financial statements; 
 — reviewing significant financial reporting matters and  

accounting policies;

 — assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and  

risk management systems (along with the Risk Committee);
 — monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s  

Internal Audit function, including its scope of work and findings,  
and ensuring that it has adequate resources and appropriate access 
to information to perform its duties effectively and independently  
from executive management;

 — overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, including 
monitoring their objectivity and independence, approving the  
annual audit plan and reviewing external audit findings; and

 — approving the external audit fees, monitoring non-audit fees paid to 
the external auditor and ensuring that the external audit is put out to 
tender on a periodic basis.

Further details on the functions and responsibilities of the Committee 
can be found in the Committee’s Terms of Reference which are 
reviewed annually and are available from the Group Company Secretary 
or in the corporate governance section of the Group’s website at: 
https://www.lseg.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance.

The Audit Committee Terms of Reference were updated and approved 
by the Board during the year to align with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC) new Audit Committee Minimum Standard and to include 
responsibility over certain non-financial reporting requirements including 
sustainability disclosure. 

This report considers how the Committee has fulfilled its responsibilities 
during the year.

Report of the Audit Committee continued

Committee membership and attendance
The Committee comprises four (2022: four) Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. All Committee members have been in place for the full year. 

Other members of management may also be invited to present  
specific matters. The Group Company Secretary is the Secretary to  
the Committee.

The skills and experience of each Committee member are provided in 
the Board of Directors section on pages 94 to 97. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) requires that at least one member of the 
Committee should have recent and relevant financial experience and 
that members shall have competence relevant to the sector in which the 
Company operates. The Committee members have a wide range of 
experience. The Chair of the Committee, Dominic Blakemore, is a 
qualified chartered accountant with a career in a variety of senior 
finance roles. The Chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees each sit  
on both committees, which makes sure that issues relevant to both 
committees are identified and managed.

The Committee’s effectiveness was assessed as part of the 2023 Board 
effectiveness review. More details on the Committee’s effectiveness can 
be found in the Governance section of this report on pages 102 to 103.

The Group Chair, Group Chief Executive Officer, Group Chief Financial 
Officer, Group Financial Controller, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Chief 
Internal Auditor, and representatives of the external auditor, EY LLP (EY), 
are all regular attendees at Committee meetings. Representatives of 
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) also started to attend Audit Committee meetings 
ahead of their formal appointment as auditors to the Group in 2024. 

In addition to formal meetings, the Chair of the Committee and some 
Committee members met with senior management during the year.  
The Chair of the Committee also meets separately with the external 
auditor, as required, ahead of each meeting. 

Activities during the year
Below we set out the main work undertaken by the  
Audit Committee covering:
1. Financial reporting;
2. Internal controls, internal audit and risk management;
3. Oversight of the external auditor; and
4. Other activities in the year.

1. Financial reporting
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions and 
matters related to the financial statements
The Committee reviewed, discussed and approved the half-year  
and full-year financial results, significant accounting judgements and 
estimates and the adequacy of disclosures. The main topics considered 
are set out below, the first four of which are also identified as key audit 
matters by the external auditor.

Matter considered

How the Committee addressed the matter

Acquisitions of Acadia and Yieldbroker
During 2023, the Group completed two significant acquisitions.  
This required the valuation of acquired tangible and intangible assets, 
including customer relationships, technology and goodwill.

The fair value of acquired intangible assets and resulting goodwill 
recognised on acquisition are subject to significant estimates. These 
include the future performance of the acquired business and the rate  
of return required to determine an appropriate discount rate (in order  
to calculate the net present value of the assets acquired).

Measurement of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill
The Group carries significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible 
assets on its balance sheet. In line with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, 
goodwill allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units is assessed  
for impairment. An assessment of the useful life and amortisation method 
was performed for certain acquired intangibles, for which there were 
indicators that a change in amortisation method or amortisation period  
may be required.

Impairment tests for the Group’s CGUs are based on value-in-use 
calculations which require significant estimates over:
 — future performance;
 — growth rates; and
 — discount rates.

Capitalisation and subsequent impairment of internally  
developed software 
The Group continues to develop and capitalise significant levels of 
software. The capitalisation of software development costs involves 
management judgement against criteria set in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.

The Committee reviewed the acquisition accounting for each significant 
acquisition, including:
 — determination of the consideration paid;
 — assessment of arrangements for any contingent payments;
 — identification and valuation of acquired net assets with a particular focus 

on intangible assets;
 — resulting goodwill; and
 — alignment with LSEG accounting policies.

The Committee satisfied itself that goodwill and purchased intangibles had 
been recognised appropriately.

See note 9 to the financial statements on pages 195 to 199. 

The Committee considered the approach and methodology to performing 
the detailed annual CGU impairment assessment. This included reviewing 
key assumptions:
 — cash flow expectations;
 — short- and long-term growth rates; and
 — discount rates used for the CGU’s cost of capital.

Given the significant changes in inflation and interest rates during the year, 
the Committee was particularly focused on the growth rate assumptions and 
the discount rates used. 

The Committee considered and approved the change in amortisation 
method of particular purchased software intangible assets as well as 
changes in useful life for certain assets.

See note 9 to the financial statements on pages 195 to 199 for details of  
the impairment review. 

The Committee reviewed the methodology used to capitalise software 
development costs and satisfied itself that it was adequate and in conformity 
with IFRS.

The Committee also considered possible indicators of impairment for 
significant internally developed software. 

The Committee approved the recognition of £10 million of internally 
developed software asset impairment in the year.

Matter considered

How the Committee addressed the matter

Revenue recognition
The Group generates revenue from a variety of sources that are material 
in size and volume. Judgements are applied to the timing of revenue 
recognition and year-end revenue accruals, particularly across 
subscription revenues, primary markets admission fees, deferred listings 
revenue and FTSE Russell revenue accruals.

Uncertain tax positions
The Group is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it 
operates. There are five main ongoing tax assessments for which the 
Group has used guidance under IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax 
Treatments to determine the possible outcomes, and any related 
obligations, and to assign a probability to each of those outcomes:
 — EU State Aid
 — US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Audit
 — Russian tax audit
 — Valuation of certain Refinitiv intellectual property
 — Diverted Profits Tax to Thomson Reuters

Non-underlying items/alternative performance measures
The Group separately identifies results before non-underlying items 
(these are referred to as “adjusted”). The Group uses its judgement to 
classify items as non-underlying (see note 2.3 to the financial statements 
on page 181).

The Committee was satisfied that sufficient analysis had been performed 
in this area to conclude that revenue has been recognised appropriately 
and that there is no evidence that any manipulation of revenues has  
taken place.

The Committee also reviewed the significance of judgements applied and 
discussed any necessary disclosure requirements. It was concluded that 
no judgement on revenue recognition required individual disclosure in the 
Annual Report.

The Committee reviewed the main items at each Committee meeting with 
a particular focus on the in-year developments below:
 — IRS Audit: The Committee has assessed the financial reporting 

implications of the Group’s ongoing discussions with the IRS in relation 
to the funding structure within its US subsidiaries following partial 
settlement agreed in the year.

 — Russian tax audit The Committee discussed the audit by the Russian 
Tax Authorities for the period 2018-2020, which the Group expects to 
be settled locally on a similar basis to the settlement for the audit of the 
period 2021-2022.

 — Diverted Profits Tax: The Committee noted that HMRC’s review of two 
of the three years had been completed, allowing for a reduction in the 
associated provision.

The Audit Committee determined that the provisions and disclosure for 
these matters are appropriate.

See note 6.3 to the financial statements on page 193 for details of the 
uncertain tax positions. 

The Committee discussed and agreed on the classification of non-
underlying items in the financial statements for the year. In particular, the 
Committee discussed the nature and amounts of:
 — transaction costs;
 — integration and separation costs;
 — restructuring costs;
 — remeasurement gains; and
 — amortisation of purchased intangibles, mainly linked to the acquisition of 

Refinitiv in 2021.

The Committee increased the financial threshold for items to be 
considered as non-underlying, to ensure that only significant items,  
and those not in the ordinary course of business, are treated as  
non-underlying. The Committee discussed the quality of earnings in 
relation to the Group’s adjusted operating profit.

See note 2.3 to the financial statements on page 181. 

Pensions
The Group operates four defined benefit pension schemes and 
recognises a net surplus in relation to these schemes on the Group 
balance sheet. For the Group’s defined benefit schemes, judgement is 
applied to the amount of the retirement benefit assets recognised on the 
balance sheet. The defined benefit pension liabilities recognised are 
determined based on the present value of future benefit obligations 
using assumptions determined by the Group with advice from an 
independent qualified actuary.

The Committee considered the approach for the value of the retirement 
benefit assets and the assumptions applied in the calculation of the 
retirement benefit obligations. 

The Committee assessed the full buy-in policy for the LSEG Pension 
scheme and the impact on the retirement benefit surplus. 

The Committee was satisfied with the approach and assumptions applied 
by management and that a defined benefit surplus can be recognised.

See note 12 to the financial statements on pages 203 to 207.

2. Internal controls, internal audit and risk management
The Committee continued to exercise disciplined oversight of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and Internal Audit  
function, in line with principles of the Code. It fulfilled its responsibilities 
by reviewing and discussing regular reports from management,  
the external auditor and the Internal Audit function including: 
 — reports on compliance with the Code – internal controls  

 — quarterly updates on internal audit delivery; 
 — regular updates on improvements to the Internal Audit function; 
 — an annual report on the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function  

at the first Committee meeting of the year; and

 — the external audit management letter from EY. The letter highlighted 

areas for improvement which were noted by the Committee for 
follow-up.

(including whistleblowing); 

 — a report on the Group’s plan to comply with the UK Government’s 

Audit and Corporate Governance reform;

 — three progress updates on the programme to create a single and 

leading financial control framework;

111

During the year, the Committee received an update on the Internal Audit 
function, which included: 
 — the development of a refreshed target operating model to reflect the 
enlarged business and global footprint. The Committee endorsed the 
approach for building out the global audit function;

Report of the Audit Committee continued

 — a review of Internal Audit’s balanced scorecard; and
 — the Results of Quality Assurance activities undertaken during the year.

Impact of acquisitions and disposals on the risk landscape
As a result of the acquisitions throughout the year, the internal audit 
universe was updated to reflect the changed organisation. As part of 
annual planning, an inherent risk assessment was undertaken which, 
alongside regulatory requirement for internal audit work, guided the 
audit plan for 2023 and, similarly, the plan for 2024. 

Management is undertaking significant work to ensure that the risk 
landscape is fully understood and that appropriate controls are in 
place to mitigate risk to within the firm’s stated risk appetite over 
time. This work will be supported by the Risk function and by Internal 
Audit, both of whom are building out resources to support the 
necessary oversight and assurance. 

Internal Audit provides independent assurance on the design and 
effectiveness of controls that support first line business activities as well 
as the Group’s risk management and governance frameworks. Internal 
Audit adopts a risk-based audit approach that prioritises providing 
assurance over the management of key risks that may impact the Group. 

As regards the work of Internal Audit, the Committee: 
 — monitored Internal Audit’s progress against the 2023 Audit Plan, 

including reviewing and approving any changes to the plan during  
the course of the year; 

 — in December 2023, considered and approved the 2024 Internal Audit 

plan and budget and is satisfied that the plan is appropriate;
 — received the annual Internal Audit Opinion which sets out the 
function’s view on the effectiveness of the Group’s control 
environment and risk culture as well as themes and root cause 
analysis arising from audit work performed;

 — received updates on emerging audit issues and themes during  

the course of the year;

 — tracked management’s progress to address actions within  

reasonable timeframes;

 — approved the Internal Audit Charter which remained consistent  

with the prior year;

 — tracked the implementation of functional improvement actions which 
followed from the 2022 External Quality Assurance review, which 
confirmed that Internal Audit generally conforms with applicable 
Internal Auditing standards; and

 — received a report from the Head of Audit Practices and Operations  

on the results of the function’s Quality Assurance activities. 

The Committee obtained additional comfort by meeting with the Group 
Chief Internal Auditor at each Committee meeting without executive 
management present. In addition, the Group Chief Internal Auditor 
meets regularly with the Chair of the Audit Committee. The Group  
Chief Internal Auditor continues to report to the Audit Committee Chair 
with a secondary reporting line to the Group Chief Executive Officer.  
This is consistent with industry guidance. 

The activities of the Committee relating to internal controls enabled it to 
satisfy itself that the Internal Audit function is independent, objective  
and adequately staffed to perform its duties. In addition, the Committee 
assessed the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function throughout the 
year using qualitative and quantitative indicators including: 
 — the Internal Audit balanced scorecard which is presented at each 

Committee meeting and reflects key performance indicators relating 
to internal audit plan delivery, quality assurance results, staff 
engagement and resourcing, as well as the financial management  
of the function; 

 — completeness of the audit plan against the agreed coverage model;
 — quality of the audit reports and the issues raised;
 — root cause insights on the issues raised and feedback from executive 

management on specific audits; and

 — other performance indicators such as the distribution of audit  
ratings, percentage of past due actions and percentage of  
self-identified issues. 

The Committee concluded that the Internal Audit function is both 
independent and effective, in line with principle M of the Code.  
In addition, the Committee (in conjunction with the Risk Committee) 
relied on this assurance process throughout the year to recommend to 
the full Board that it could report to shareholders on the effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems. This 
assurance satisfies principle O of the Code. The Board statement can 
be found on page 104. 

3. Oversight of the external auditor
The Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the 
relationship with the external auditor. This includes recommending  
the auditor’s appointment at the AGM, continuous assessment of the 
auditor’s independence, the effectiveness and quality of the audit, 
approving the statutory audit fee and non-audit services, reviewing and 
approving the annual audit plan and meeting with the external auditor  
to review any issues and the findings of the audit.

The Committee reviewed and approved the 2023 audit plan presented 
by EY. This included the scope of the audit, the assessment of the key 
audit risks and areas of focus as well as the materiality threshold for the 
Group and the threshold for reporting unadjusted differences. Reports 
from EY on the status of their 2023 plan and the results of their work,  
as well as EY’s own assessment of their independence, were received 
throughout the year. The external auditor’s reports were discussed at 
each Committee meeting and their views and opinions used to 
challenge decisions by the Group.

The Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external audit 
throughout the year in accordance with principle M of the Code.  
The Committee relied on its own judgement supported by the  
following evidence:
 — a report from management on their own evaluation of the 

effectiveness of the external auditor based on a questionnaire 
prepared in accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) 
guidance and completed by key stakeholders;

 — a review of the FRC’s 2022/2023 Audit Quality Inspection and 

Supervision Report, specifically the report related to EY. The Audit 
Committee also reviewed the results of the FRC’s inspection of the 
LSEG 2021 year end audit which highlighted limited improvements 
required; and

 — the separate meetings held with EY at each Committee meeting 

without management being present.

Based on all evidence presented, the Committee satisfied itself that the 
external audit has been conducted effectively, with appropriate rigour 
and challenge, and that EY had applied appropriate professional 
scepticism throughout the audit.

EY were appointed as the Group’s external auditor in 2014. The lead 
audit partner and other key partners identified are required to rotate 
every five years. Other partners are required to rotate every seven 
years. Simon Michaelson was reappointed as lead audit partner  
during the year and is in his second year. 

The Committee is responsible for conducting the process to select the 
external auditor and recommends their appointment, reappointment  
and removal to the Board for approval by the Group’s shareholders at 
each AGM.

Getting ready for a change in auditor 
As disclosed in last year’s report, following an audit tender 
process in 2022, the Audit Committee recommended to the 
Board that Deloitte be appointed as the Group’s external auditor 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2024, subject to 
shareholder approval at our AGM. 

In early 2023, the Committee was made aware of non-audit tax 
advisory services which were provided to certain entities  
within the Group by Deloitte, which audited one of the Group’s 
subsidiaries. It was concluded that these services were prohibited 
under the FRC’s Ethical Standard. EY placed reliance on the work 
performed by this component audit firm. As a result, a special 
Audit Committee meeting was held to review the independence 
of our external auditors and the services being provided and 
relied upon. The decision to change auditor to Deloitte was 
upheld but additional reviews of independence as a part of the 
onboarding process were undertaken throughout the year. 

As a part of the onboarding process, the Group have undertaken 
the following:
 — Worked with Deloitte to make sure that they are fully 

independent ahead of 1 January 2024.

 — The Group updated its policy for “Services supplied by  

Audit firms”, which clarifies key deliverables and responsibilities 
of audit firms as well as adding further internal controls to 
monitor services provided by audit firms.

 — Testing of Deloitte’s tools and technology to ensure they meet 

the Group’s information security requirements.

Deloitte have started preliminary work to gain an understanding 
of the Group and have shadowed EY during their audit of the 
Group’s 2023 Annual Report and Accounts, including attending 
some meetings alongside EY. 

The Committee satisfied itself that the procedures of Deloitte  
in their capacity as auditor of Tradeweb have been conducted 
independently and have not impeded the effectiveness of the 
existing external auditor.

Report on external auditor’s fees and safeguards on  
non-audit services
The Committee has a policy governing the engagement of the external 
auditor to provide non-audit services, which is reviewed on an annual 
basis. This policy was updated during the year to reflect Deloitte’s role 
as incoming auditor, and the policy has been applied to both EY and 
Deloitte during the year. 

The policy prohibits certain activities from being undertaken by the 
external auditor such as: accounting/bookkeeping services; internal 
auditing; certain tax and payroll services; executive recruitment; 
remuneration services; and more generally any work which could 
compromise their independence. The policy also places restrictions  
on the employment of former employees of the external auditor.

Recognising that the external auditor may be best placed to undertake 
certain work, the policy permits the provision of certain audit-related  
and non-audit services. The policy allows approval for any audit and 
non-audit services below £100k to be delegated to the Group Chief 
Financial Officer. Any such approvals are then reported to the Audit 
Committee at the next meeting.

The Committee fully complied with the policy in the year. It reviewed 
each of the appointments on their merits and considered management’s 
assessment of:
 — the threats to independence and objectivity resulting from the 

provision of such services;

 — whether there were any conflicts of interest; and
 — the quantum of non-audit fees in the context of the overall audit fee.

A breakdown of audit and non-audit service fees paid and payable to 
the external auditor for the year ended 31 December 2023 is provided 
below and in Note 4.2 to the financial statements on page 188.

EY provided non-audit services of £0.7 million; 5% of total fees  
(2022: £0.6 million; 4% of total fees). This comprised of audit related 
assurance services of £0.4 million (2022: £0.4 million) and other 
non-audit services £0.3 million (2022: £0.2 million).

In each case, the Committee concluded that the appointment of EY  
to perform certain non-audit services would not impair their 
independence and represented the most effective, secure and efficient 
way of obtaining the necessary advice and services. The Committee 
was satisfied that the Group and EY have been compliant with IESBA 
and FRC auditor independence rules. 

The Committee has complied with the relevant parts of the Competition 
and Markets Authority Final Order on the statutory audit market for the 
year ended 31 December 2023.

4. Other matters
Going concern and long-term financial viability statement
The Directors are required to assess whether it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis and, in 
accordance with the Code, provide a statement on the Group’s viability. 
At its meeting in February 2024, the Committee reviewed the Group’s 
forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance. It confirmed that the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements continues to be appropriate. 
See page 159 of the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for the 
going concern statement. At the same meeting, the Committee also 
considered the Group’s long-term viability with reference to the Group’s 
current position and prospects, three-year business plan, risk appetite 
and the expected impact of severe but plausible downside scenarios  
on the business. See page 89 of the Strategic Report for the financial 
viability statement.

FRC Corporate Reporting Review
As part of the FRC’s Corporate Reporting Review, the FRC conducted  
a review of the Group’s 2022 Annual Report. The review was conducted 
independently and the scope of the review was based on and limited  
to the information provided in the 2022 Annual Report1. The Group 
received correspondence from the FRC in October 2023 requesting 
further information in relation to the alternative performance measures 
included in the Group’s financial reporting and on climate-related 
financial disclosures. 

1  The FRC review provides no assurance that the LSEG Annual Report 2022 was correct in all material respects. The FRC’s role was not to verify the information provided, but to consider 

compliance with reporting requirements. Its letters are written on the basis that the FRC (which includes the FRC’s officers, employees and agents) accepts no liability for reliance on them by  
LSEG or any third party, including but not limited to investors and shareholders.

Report of the Audit Committee continued

The Group provided a response to the FRC in November 2023, 
responding to the questions raised and how they have been addressed 
in this Annual Report. The Audit Committee was informed on the 
response submitted to the FRC. The FRC responded in December 
2023, confirming that their enquiries are now closed. 

Fair, balanced and understandable (FBU) reporting
In line with principle N of the Code, the Committee satisfied itself that 
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and has 
presented its conclusions to the Board. The Committee reviewed drafts 
of the Annual Report and Accounts and considered the following:
 — that statutory measures have been given equal prominence to the 

alternative performance measures used;

 — that information contained in the Strategic Report represents a fair 

reflection of performance during the year;

 — information within the Strategic Report and narrative reporting across 
the Annual Report is consistent with that reported in the financial 
statements; and

 — key areas of estimate and judgement are consistently applied. 

The Committee discussed with management the process undertaken  
to ensure that the relevant requirements of FBU reporting were met. 
This process included:
 — independent reviews of the entire report by people not directly 

involved in preparing the report; 

 — extensive review and verification processes by the appropriate 

departments and senior managers to ensure the accuracy of the 
content; and

 — consideration of the balance of disclosure between positive and 

negative points on the Group’s performance in the year.

See page 159 of the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for the  
FBU statement.

Audit and Corporate Governance Reform
The Committee received a number of updates on how the Group is 
preparing for the UK Government’s Audit and Corporate Governance 
Reform. While the UK Government has now withdrawn and delayed 
some of the proposals, the Group remains committed to enhancing its 
internal control environment and has continued to implement its main 
programmes. The Committee monitored and assessed the progress of: 
 — the refresh of the Financial Control Framework;
 — the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Operational 

Resilience programmes;

 — the fraud risk assessment performed in the year; and
 — steps being taken to improve control training and risk-awareness.

The Committee noted that the revised UK Corporate Governance Code 
was issued in January 2024, effective from 2025, and that the ongoing 
programmes around internal controls put the Group in a good position 
to meet the requirements of the new Code. 

Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard
During the year, the FRC announced its Audit Committees and the 
External Audit: Minimum Standard. The Committee discussed and 
reviewed the Audit Committee responsibilities and the minimum 
requirements set out for an Audit Committee to perform. The Committee 
noted and were comfortable with the requirements set out and updated 
its own Terms of Reference to align with the Standard.

Sustainability and climate risk reporting
The Committee reviewed the broader landscape for sustainability and 
climate risk reporting and the Group’s plans for ensuring it remains 
compliant with future changes to the reporting requirements. 

During the year, the ISSB issued IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 (the “Standards”) to 
improve disclosures about sustainability of a company. The Committee 
noted the implications of the new Standards, that once endorsed by the 
UK Endorsement Board LSEG is subject to the mandatory sustainability 
reporting requirements to be reported on for the first time for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2024, and the procedures being 
undertaken in advance of the reporting requirement coming into force.

Incoming regulation, notably the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD), will introduce mandatory assurance of reported 
sustainability data. The Committee discussed CSRD and the findings of 
an independent pre-assurance readiness report commissioned by the 
Group covering LSEG’s current processes, systems and controls over 
the calculation and disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, which was 
used as a case study. The Committee also noted the Group’s plan to 
address the findings of the report as a part of the broader sustainability 
reporting agenda.

Whistleblowing investigations
The Group’s whistleblowing policy provides a method of addressing 
concerns while at the same time offering whistleblowers protection from 
victimisation, harassment or disciplinary proceedings. During the year, 
the Committee continued to closely monitor the effectiveness and 
independence of the Speak-Up and whistleblowing arrangements  
of the Group.

Areas of focus in 2024 
 — Assessing the Group’s readiness to comply with climate-related 

disclosure requirements, including the CSRD.

 — Monitoring the progress of the Financial Control Framework.
 — Receiving early and continuous understanding of the impact of the 
Group’s acquisitions and disposals on financial and tax accounting, 
and ensuring that the transactions are accurately represented in the 
Group’s Annual Reports and Accounts.

 — Monitoring the Group’s uncertain tax positions.
 — Continuing to assess the impact of developments in  

accounting standards.

 — Monitoring the progress of the external audit transition from  
EY to Deloitte and ensuring Deloitte’s readiness for the 2024 
year-end audit. 

 — Receiving assurance that the internal control and risk management 

environment remains robust.

 — Monitoring the enhanced use of data in Internal Audit work to  

provide broader insights and analysis.

 — Monitoring the development and embedding of audit programmes  

of work related to specialisms such as sustainability and behavioural 
risks across the Internal Audit function.

 — Supporting the build-out of the Internal Audit capabilities in the areas 

of transformation and change assurance.

Achievements for 2023
During the year, the Risk Committee prioritised programmes and 
activities identified at the end of the previous financial year with the  
aim of enabling the safe growth of the Group by continuing to improve 
the Group’s risk culture and ensuring that risks stayed within the set 
appetite. These activities included:
 — continued embedding of the Group’s operational resilience programme; 
 — continued review and monitoring of potential impacts from 

macroeconomic and geopolitical events on the Group’s strategy  
and business model;

 — enhancing further the approach to sustainability-related risks and 

associated risk processes;

 — continued focus on technology remediation and enhancement of  

the cyber security framework; and

 — continued monitoring of the Group’s risk profile, against risk appetite, 

across both financial and non-financial risks.

Composition and meetings 
The Committee comprises five independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The skills and experience of each Committee member are provided in 
the Board of Directors section on pages 94 to 97. All Committee 
members have been in place for more than a year.

The Group Chair, Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer, 
Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Group Chief Internal Auditor, are all 
standing attendees at Committee meetings. A member of the Company 
Secretariat is the Secretary to the Committee. In addition to the standing 
attendees, various other members of management are invited to 
present specific matters relevant to the Committee’s remit.

The Board is satisfied that each member of the Committee has the skills 
and experience necessary for the Committee to effectively discharge  
its responsibilities. The Chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees each  
sit on both committees, which ensures appropriate identification and 
management of issues relevant to both committees.

During 2023, the Risk Committee held four regular meetings. In the 
ordinary course of business, the Committee regularly reviews the 
Group’s risk profile, risk appetite and emerging risks. The CRO also 
provides regular updates to the Chair throughout the year.

The Group continues to support  
its key markets and deliver stable 
and resilient services that meet  
our clients’ needs. The Group’s  
risk culture, objectives, appetite, 
governance and operations are 
well established, underpinning  
the whole organisation.

Report of the Risk Committee continued

Purpose, responsibility and terms of reference 
The Committee has non-executive responsibility for high-level risk 
related matters and for risk governance. The Committee reviews the risk 
profile of the Group, and its divisions, on a regular basis and comments 
on the adequacy of the processes in place to identify, manage, mitigate 
and report on key risks. It advises the Board on the Company’s overall 
risk appetite, tolerance and strategy, and reviews the adequacy of  
the Enterprise Risk Management Framework and its application to 
decision-making. 

The Committee sets the criteria for the accurate and timely reporting of 
material risks including regular reports on compliance for each regulated 
entity. As part of this mandate, the Committee also regularly reviews 
best practices for enterprise risk management.

Further details on the functions and responsibilities of the Risk 
Committee can be found in the Committee’s terms of reference which 
are reviewed annually and available from the Group Company Secretary, 
or in the corporate governance section of the Group’s website at:  
www.lseg.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance.

Summary of the key areas of focus 
During the year, the Risk Committee focused efforts on programmes  
to further embed the Group Enterprise Risk Management Framework 
(ERMF) and further strengthen risk culture across the organisation.  
The Committee prioritised key activities which supported the vision of 
the Group Risk function, enabling the achievement of the 2023 Group 
strategic objectives. These included:
 — enhancing the approach to sustainability-related risks and associated 
risk processes. The Committee also approved the Group sustainability 
risk framework;

 — embedding the operational resilience framework; and
 — creating a stronger risk culture through Group-wide risk awareness 
events and training sessions e.g., 2023 Risk Culture Week at the  
start of the year to raise risk awareness. 

Activities of the Committee 
The Committee established formal agendas covering all responsibilities 
delineated in the Committee’s terms of reference. During the year, the 
Committee discharged these responsibilities with the following activities:
 — Provided robust reviews of principal risks and of emerging risks with  

a focus on:
 — reviewing and recommending to the Board the Group risk appetite, 

including stress tests and challenging the scenario results;

 — monitoring the Group’s risk profile against risk appetite as well  
as progress of remediation activities over the past 12 months,  
and monitored financial resources; 

 — challenging management’s assessment of the Group’s risk  

profile, across both financial and non-financial risk, as well as 
management’s mitigating actions;

 — reviewing and challenging scenario analyses, identification, 

management and mitigation of risks across the Group;

 — reviewing plans to enhance cyber security and operational 

resilience, and reviewing high level focus topics e.g., cyber security, 
cloud risk, greenwashing, US debt ceiling; and

 — reviewing risk events and emerging risk topics throughout the year; 
assessing the potential impacts of the ongoing global geopolitical 
tensions and the evolving financial landscape on the Group’s 
strategy and business model, including: 
 —  Russia/Ukraine, China/Taiwan, Middle East, Sri-Lanka; 
 — the banking crises – Credit Suisse, Silicon Valley Bank,  

US debt ceiling

 — Monitoring compliance in line with the Group risk management 
procedures as described in the section on internal controls on  
page 104 which included:
 — reviewing regulatory compliance reports and the actions in place  

to ensure ongoing compliance;

 — reviewing the adequacy of the Group’s business continuity 

management plans; and

 — reviewing and recommending to the Board the Group risk appetite, 

including stress tests and challenging the scenario results.

Risk management function 
The CRO leads and oversees all aspects of risk management for the 
Group. He reports to the Chief Executive Officer, and also, to ensure 
independence, to the Chair of the Risk Committee. The Committee 
approves the CRO’s remit and ensures that the CRO has the 
independence and resources necessary to perform their duty.  
Group management consults with the Committee on the appointment 
and dismissal of the CRO.

The Committee meets with the CRO without the presence of executive 
management at each Committee meeting.

2024 priorities 
In 2024, the Committee’s priorities include:
 — continued monitoring of the Group’s risk profile against risk appetite 
and oversight of risk mitigation and control enhancement activities;
 — continued monitoring of potential impacts from macroeconomic and 

geopolitical events; and

 — continued oversight of the Group’s risk culture and embedding of the 

Enterprise Risk Management Framework.

Committee effectiveness 
The Committee’s effectiveness was assessed as part of the 2023  
Board and Committee effectiveness review. Further details can be  
found in the Governance section of this report on pages 102 to 103.  
The result of the review was that the Committee is performing well  
and operating effectively.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued

Statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee

I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the  
year ended 31 December 2023. This is my first report since assuming 
the role of Chair of the Remuneration Committee in September last year 
and I would like to thank my predecessor, Cressida Hogg, for her 
leadership of the Committee.

This year we will be asking shareholders to vote on three remuneration 
resolutions at our 2024 AGM:
 — our Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”), which outlines the 

remuneration framework that will apply to our Executive Directors, 
Non-Executive Directors and the Group Chair should it be approved 
by shareholders (set out on pages 127 to 136);

 — our Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out remuneration 

outcomes for 2023 and explains how we intend to apply the Policy  
in 2024 (set out on pages 137 to 153); and

 — our new long-term incentive plan rules (the Equity Incentive Plan or 
EIP), which will replace the existing Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 
which expires this year (further information is provided in the Notice  
of AGM).

This statement on pages 118 to 123 provides context for the decisions 
made by the Committee in the year, summarising in particular the 
proposed changes to our Remuneration Policy and the background and 
rationale for the adjustments. A “Remuneration at a glance” section is 
included after this statement on pages 124 to 126 which summarises 
broader employee reward at LSEG, 2023 remuneration outcomes  
for Executive Directors, and the proposed operation of incentive  
plans in 2024.

2024 Remuneration Policy review
As we signalled in our Directors’ Remuneration Report last year, the 
Committee has conducted a comprehensive review of the existing 
Policy to ensure that it remains fit for purpose so we retain and attract 
the global talent that has delivered the business transformation and 
shareholder value creation to date and who will continue to capture 
significant opportunities in the future.

We are proposing to update the Policy for Executive Directors to  
reflect that:
 — LSEG has transformed and is now a leading global financial markets 
infrastructure and data provider, which is larger, more diversified and 
more complex than at the time of the last material Policy review;
 — the market for our senior leadership team is now a set of global 

companies in similar geographic and business segments as LSEG, 
where pay levels are often significantly higher (further information  
on our global sector peers and the selection approach is set out on 
pages 118 to 119);

 — significant pay compression is now observed within LSEG as a result 
of our need to compete for talent with the largest global players in  
the financial markets infrastructure and data provision sector; and

 — we need to ensure that the LSEG pay structures, measures and 

targets reinforce continuation of the strong performance delivered  
by our exceptional management team in recent years.

As part of the review we consulted extensively with nearly 100 
shareholders, representing approximately 80% of LSEG’s voting rights, 
and proxy agencies. I would like to thank everyone we engaged with for 
their valuable input during this process, which has informed the detail of 
our revised Policy. Overall, the majority of shareholders were supportive 
of our proposals and recognised the rationale of our thinking in light  
of the transformation and high performance of the business, both in 
absolute and relative terms, under our CEO’s leadership, and the need 
for LSEG to compete in a global talent market. 

A summary of the context against which the Committee has reviewed 
the Policy, our rationale for adjusting it and detail of the proposed 
changes is set out below.

Business transformation
Over the last five years, LSEG has transformed in terms of global 
breadth, scope, scale and performance. The business has grown  
from a European regional exchange group into a diversified, global 
provider of financial markets infrastructure and data services. LSEG  
is systemically important in the major geographies of the world, with  
a trusted reputation and strong culture and is making significant 
strategic moves which have most notably included the acquisition  
of Refinitiv and our partnership with Microsoft.

At the heart of LSEG’s transformation has been our executive team, led 
by our CEO, David Schwimmer. The ambitious strategy developed and 
executed by our executive team has changed and strengthened the 
Group, positioning it to grow and succeed, while creating significant 
sustainable long-term shareholder value. Over the course of this 
transformation and David’s tenure (since 1 August 2018), we have:
 — generated total shareholder return of 124% and created £19 billion  

in shareholder value (31 July 2018 – 31 December 2023);

 — increased Adjusted EPS by 118% from 148.7 pence to 323.9 pence  

(31 December 2017 – 31 December 2023);

 — increased our Dividend Per Share 123% from 52 pence to 115 pence  

(31 December 2017 – 31 December 2023);
 — de-levered our Refinitiv acquisition debt; and
 — more than doubled our share price from £43.57 to £92.74  

(1 August 2018 – 31 December 2023).

LSEG is now a heavily tech-oriented organisation with over 25,000 
employees operating across over 60 countries, competing for senior 
leadership talent at a global level. We are also experiencing frequent 
approaches for our talent from global companies, particularly from 
technology and financial services organisations, where pay levels are 
materially higher. This is evident even for our functional leadership roles 
with the departure of our highly regarded CFO, Anna Manz, to join a 
global Swiss-based company and COO, David Shalders, who will join a 
private equity backed financial services company at the end of this year.

Our global sector peers 
With LSEG’s continued transformation, there is a significant step-change 
in our talent requirements and a need to increase the focus on  
how LSEG’s business performance and remuneration compares  
to appropriate sector peers. The Committee therefore undertook  
a comprehensive selection process to identify those companies who 
represent the most appropriate peer group for LSEG. Whilst LSEG’s 
complex end-to-end trade lifecycle offering does not have an exact 
comparator in the market, this selected peer set (shown in the chart on 
page 119) reflects LSEG’s diverse operations, complexity, size and global 
footprint. They represent a comparable group of companies against 
whom we both measure our performance (and which will comprise  
a TSR benchmark for long-term incentive awards going forward)  
and compete for senior level talent and expertise. 

LSEG’s global sector peer group (summarised in the table on page 119) 
consists of organisations of comparable scale and complexity from 
sectors in which LSEG operates, and includes:
 — Financial Markets Infrastructure companies with whom we compete 
and, together with LSEG, constitute the global regulated markets  
that facilitate capital raising, trading and clearing/settlement across  
a range of asset classes; plus

 — global competitors in the provision of data and analytics solutions 
across financial asset classes that support decision-making across 
trading, compliance and risk management in financial markets; plus
 — leading multinational B2B providers of comparable scale to LSEG,  
that provide data and analytics solutions that identify opportunities 
and manage the risks of doing business.

Following extensive analysis, an exclusive group of relevant peers was 
selected from a longer list of firms initially considered.

Statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee continued

Remuneration and performance context
Market pay and performance benchmarking demonstrates that our 
CEO’s pay is significantly below the lower quartile of our sector peers 
(shown above) despite LSEG achieving median to upper quartile  
TSR and EPS performance. This pay-and-performance mismatch has 
persisted over time: over the past four years, David’s cumulative  
pay ranked at the 7th percentile of sector peers, against an EPS 
performance in the 93rd percentile when compared with the same  
peer set (see chart below).

Further, David was the architect of the transformational Refinitiv deal, 
driving the acquisition and successful integration. In addition to the 
strategic benefits with the increased and successful focus on data and 
analytics, the management team has out-delivered on synergies. The 
Group has also continued to grow both organically and through several 
other acquisitions, as well as the strategic partnership with Microsoft, 
which greatly accelerates our growth and transformation plans.

Notes
Company size dimensions: market cap based on spot values for all companies 
on 31 December 2023; revenue and employees based on FY22 ﬁgures to allow 
a like-for-like comparison. 
Company performance: 4-year TSR and EPS performance cover the period ending 
FY2022, aligning with David Schwimmer’s appointment as CEO on 1 August 2018.
CEO pay: 4-year actual pay based on FY2019-FY2022 data as disclosed in the 
summary compensation table (for US peers) and single ﬁgure table (or equivalent, 
for UK/European peers).

The disconnects between (a) our pay and performance, (b) our pay and 
market position, and (c) our pay and calibre of talent, create a substantial 
risk around talent attraction and retention at LSEG.

With David now entering his sixth year as CEO, the Committee believes 
it is important to retain David who will continue to play a critical role  
in leading LSEG through the next phase of transformational growth.

The increasingly competitive global landscape for senior leadership 
talent, particularly those individuals with technology and data 
backgrounds, has resulted in upwards pressure on pay. We are 
experiencing pay compression between our CEO and other recent 
senior hires over the last 12 months, both in absolute terms and 
compared to typical market relativities, as shown below. In order to 
attract the capabilities needed in new senior talent from leading global 
companies, we have had to offer enhanced pay arrangements with  
a significant uplift in quantum when compared to previous pay practices 
and FTSE benchmarks. We have also observed pay disparities when 
recruiting US-based talent with many candidates having existing pay 
levels that are higher than our CEO’s. A particular example of our pay 
disparities with market is that our CEO is paid less than the CEO of  
our US subsidiary, Tradeweb, which has approximately one-third of  
the market capitalisation of LSEG.

With respect to meeting their shared obligations for succession 
planning, the Board and the Committee believe that any credible  
CEO candidate in the future would have to be sourced from the global 
talent market, where the current Policy would be unable to compete in 
terms of expected remuneration packages.

Remuneration Policy proposals
Against this backdrop, the Committee is proposing to update the  
Policy to align it with our transformed business and address our talent 
attraction and retention risks. We believe the Policy must be revised to 
be globally competitive to attract and retain the calibre of talent required 
to continue LSEG’s transformation and deliver our strategic ambition. For 
that reason, the proposed Policy resets Executive Director remuneration 
to align more closely with the median of our global sector peer pay  
(but based on consideration of the remuneration components of salary, 
annual bonus and long-term incentives, in line with the practice of  
UK listed companies). The proposed changes to the Policy and its 
implementation for Executive Directors for 2024 are presented in the 
table opposite:

Policy element Proposal

Salary

 — Increase CEO salary from £1m to £1.375m as part of 

Annual bonus

aligning overall pay more closely with the global sector 
peer median, while adhering to UK governance norms 
around bonus deferral and maximum long-term  
incentive opportunities. 

 — New CFO salary set at £850k to enable recruitment of 

top calibre talent.

 — Increase maximum opportunity from 225% to 300%  
of salary for the CEO. CFO opportunity to remain 
unchanged at 200% of salary.

 — Reduce deferral from 50% to 40% to align with recent 
change applicable below Board level and to align total 
target in-year cash to circa the median of global sector 
peers, who do not typically operate bonus deferral.

 — Re-weight Executive Director bonuses to comprise i) 75% 
financials (currently 60%) inclusive of the introduction of 
an additional measure “Future Growth” (weighted 15%) 
focussing on achievement of future revenue targets ii) 
15% Group Strategic Objectives (GSOs), and iii) 10% 
personal objectives.

Long-term 
incentives

 — Increase long-term incentive opportunity from 300% to 
550% of salary for CEO, and to 400% of salary for CFO.

 — Retain EPS and Relative TSR as vesting measures, 

weighted 60% and 40% respectively (as per current).

 — TSR metric to be split 50/50 on performance vs FTSE100 
(as current) and vs global sector peers (a new, second 
benchmark, based on the companies shown on  
page 119).

 — Introduce payment of dividend equivalents on future 

share awards, aligning to market norms.

 — Update “leaver” provisions: ensure sufficient discretion 
for RemCo to apply “good leaver” status in the event  
of retirement from professional career or to work  
in a governmental capacity or for a non-profit 
organisation, and with agreement from the  
Company/Remuneration Committee.

Minimum 
shareholding 
requirements

 — Increase minimum shareholding requirement from 400% 
to 600% of salary for CEO, and from 300% to 400% of 
salary for CFO, i.e. to be at least equal to the annual 
long-term incentive opportunity.

The revised Policy will strengthen the link between pay, performance 
and value creation for shareholders through the material increases to 
long-term performance-based pay, combined with an increase to the 
minimum shareholding requirements. It is important to highlight that  
the full impacts of the Policy proposals will not be realised until 2029 
when the 2024 long-term incentive award is released from the 
post-vesting holding period. Reflecting shareholder feedback received, 
we have made the performance targets for incentive awards even  
more stretching.

The Committee is considering the CEO remuneration package in the 
very specific circumstances of David Schwimmer, taking into account  
his outstanding past performance and strategic direction.

We believe the proposals are necessary to ensure the remuneration of 
David and the incoming CFO are strongly aligned with the delivery of 
LSEG’s ambitious medium to long-term strategy, as well as giving the 
Committee the ability to recruit the calibre of talent required to continue 
LSEG’s transformation as needed. 

121

Performance in the year
In 2023, LSEG delivered another year of strong financial performance, 
with continued revenue growth across our business divisions despite an 
uncertain macroeconomic environment. We continue to transform our 
business and deliver on our strategy to be the leading global financial 
markets infrastructure and data provider.

Highlights: 
 — Delivered 8.3% income growth on a constant currency basis.  

Growth was 7.7% excluding the Acadia acquisition, towards the  
upper end of the 6%-8% guidance range.

 — Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.6%, slightly ahead of the growth in total 

income. Excluding FX-related balance sheet items, EBITDA margin  
of 47.7%.

 — Exceeded our £400 million runrate cost synergy target 2 years ahead 
of schedule and continued to deliver strongly on our revenue synergy 
programme with £158m runrate synergies delivered to date.

 — Delivered the successful integration and acceleration of Refinitiv: 
2021-2023 total income (excl. recoveries) CAGR of 6.5% is at the 
upper end of acquisition targets.

 — Our medium-term guidance further raises growth aspirations: 

targeting mid-to-high single digit medium term organic growth, 
accelerating after 2024.

 — Making targeted acquisitions: Acadia reinforces our leading position 
in Post Trade Solutions; acquired full control of LCH SA; increased 
ownership of LCH Group.

 — Good progress on Microsoft partnership: first products expected  
in H1 2024, many embedding AI technologies and revolutionising 
industry workflows.

 — Significant shareholder returns: final dividend of 79.3 pence, taking full 
year payout to 115 pence; £1.2 billion returned via buybacks in 2023.

2023 bonus outcomes for Executive Directors
Executive Directors were eligible to receive an annual bonus based on 
meeting or exceeding bonus targets that were set at the beginning  
of the year, looking at the Group’s financial performance, strategic 
objectives and their personal contribution.

The Committee received input from the Risk Committee with regard  
to performance related to risk culture (awareness, transparency and 
accountability) when assessing remuneration decisions.

For FY2023, we exceeded our Group adjusted operating profit (AOP) 
financial target and have outperformed against our strategic objectives. 
In determining the overall outcome of the strategic objectives for the 
FY2023 Group bonus pool, the Committee took into account certain 
factors relating to risk, including compliance risk and resilience, which 
meant that despite the otherwise strong strategic performance achieved 
against the objectives, the Committee determined that, on balance,  
the overall outcome of this component should be 28%. This outturn is 
lower than the previous year’s outturn of 31%. 

As a result of the Group’s strong performance and the personal 
contribution of the Executive Directors, the Committee determined that 
the CEO will be awarded a bonus of 70% of his maximum opportunity. 
Anna Manz resigned as CFO on 25 May 2023 and is therefore not 
eligible to receive a bonus for the 2023 performance year.

Further details on FY2023 performance can be found in the Financial 
Review on pages 44 to 57.

Share plan rules and approvals
The LSEG Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 (or LTIP) approved by 
shareholders in 2014 will expire this year. As a result, we will be seeking 
shareholder approval for a new long-term incentive plan, the Equity 
Incentive Plan (or EIP), at our forthcoming AGM. Further information  
is provided in the Notice of AGM.

London Stock Exchange Group plc  Annual Report 2023GOVERNANCEDirectors’ Remuneration Report continued

Statement by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee continued

2021 LTIP award outcomes
The AEPS element of the LTIP awards made in 2021 will vest at 100% 
and the Relative TSR element will vest at 0%. These vesting outcomes 
reflect the delivery of AEPS growth of 18.3% CAGR and 8.1% TSR 
performance over the three-year performance period, the latter 
representing 43rd percentile performance relative to the FTSE 100 peer 
group. The TSR position partly reflects the significant growth in the share 
price in the years leading up to the start of the 2021 LTIP performance 
period during which LSEG was consistently upper quartile.

Discretion in relation to incentive outcomes
The incentive outcomes above are reflective of overall Group financial 
and strategic performance, and the Committee determined that no 
discretion should be exercised to adjust the formulaic outcomes.

The Committee reviewed LSEG’s share price performance in 
determining the extent to which the 2021 LTIP award should vest  
and concluded that no windfall gains had occurred.

Operation of 2024 bonus 
The FY2024 Group bonus pool will be determined based on  
Group performance measures weighted 75% on financial measures 
(60% AOP, 15% Future Growth) and 25% on strategic objectives. 

The Executive Directors’ awards are funded from the Group bonus  
pool. Bonus awards for the Executive Directors will be determined in 
accordance with performance measures weighted: 60% against  
Group AOP; 15% against Future Growth; 15% against Group Strategic 
Objectives; and 10% against personal objectives.

Annual bonuses for FY2024 will be awarded in line with our revised 
Policy, subject to shareholder approval. Under the revised Policy,  
60% of any FY2024 bonus payment for Executive Directors would be 
paid in March 2025. The remaining 40% would be deferred into shares 
for a period of three years.

Long-term incentive awards to be made in 2024
Long-term incentive awards will be granted in 2024 in line with our 
revised Policy and under the Equity Incentive Plan, in each case subject 
to shareholder approval.

The Committee has given careful attention to the AEPS element of the 
2024 grant (with a 60% weighting) and, considering internal and external 
forecasts, has set the AEPS targets at 7% to 12.5% CAGR. This means 
that both the threshold and maximum end of the ranges are higher  
than the targets set for the 2023 grant. To achieve maximum vesting,  
an incremental £1.1bn AOP would be required in 2026, equivalent to 
incremental income in the region of £2.05bn, relative to 2023. We 
expect that this AEPS range will be one of the highest, if not the highest, 
in the FTSE 30 and continues to demonstrate LSEG’s commitment to 
setting class-leading, stretching targets. Furthermore, the higher AEPS 
baseline makes AEPS CAGR growth increasingly challenging to achieve 
for LSEG.

For the Relative TSR element (40% weighting), performance will be 
assessed against our global sector peer group (the same sector peers 
we used to benchmark remuneration) and the FTSE 100, each weighted 
50:50. The performance range will be median to upper quartile for both 
peer groups.

The stretching nature of these performance targets set by the Committee 
is noted also in the context of historical grant outcomes; specifically the 
most recent 2020 and 2021 awards which have not vested at maximum 
despite the Group’s strong performance in the period.

Executive Director changes 
Departure terms for Anna Manz
Anna Manz resigned as CFO on 25 May 2023. Following publication of 
the Group’s 2023 Full Year Annual Results on 29 February 2024, she 
will step down from the Board and leave the Group. Her unvested 
incentive awards will be treated in line with the Policy in effect at the 
time of her resignation. Following her resignation, she was not eligible  
to receive a bonus for 2023 or a long-term incentive award for 2024 
and her outstanding LTIP awards lapsed. Anna continued to receive her 
contractual salary, pension allowance and benefits until her termination 
date. Full details are provided on page 146.

Appointment terms for Michel-Alain Proch
As announced on 20 November 2023, Michel-Alain Proch joined  
LSEG on 26 February 2024 and will be appointed to the Board as  
CFO on 1 March 2024. Prior to joining LSEG, Michel-Alain was the  
Group Chief Financial Officer for Publicis Groupe SA and a member  
of their Management Board. 

Michel-Alain will receive a salary of £850,000 and a pension cash 
allowance of 10% of salary (aligned with the wider workforce), along with 
other benefits offered to the wider workforce in the UK. He will also be 
eligible to participate in the Annual Bonus and Equity Incentive Plan 
under the Policy in place for 2024 (subject to shareholder approval at 
the AGM). If the proposed Policy is approved, this includes an annual 
bonus opportunity with a maximum of 200% salary and a maximum 
long-term incentive grant of 400% of salary. Michel-Alain forfeited 
various incentive awards which were inflight at the time of his leaving 
Publicis Groupe SA; LSEG has agreed to compensate for the forfeited 
amounts partly through an enhancement to Michel-Alain’s FY2024 
bonus opportunity. The combined regular FY2024 bonus (based on  
a pro-rated opportunity for the time served over FY2024) plus the 
compensatory amount will mean that his overall maximum FY2024 
bonus opportunity will be equal to 200% of his full-time salary.  
Michel-Alain will also be granted awards to compensate for other 
remuneration forfeited at Publicis Groupe SA. Full details are provided 
on pages 146.

Given Michel-Alain is relocating from Paris to London to take on the CFO 
role, LSEG will be providing immigration, relocation and tax/filing support 
in accordance with LSEG’s usual practices and approved Policy.

Committee effectiveness
The Committee’s effectiveness was assessed as part of the 2023  
Board and Committee effectiveness review. The result of the review  
was that the Committee is performing well and operating effectively. 
Further details can be found in the Governance section of this report  
on pages 102 to 103. 

Concluding remarks
The intent of this statement and the wider Directors’ Remuneration 
Report is to explain the Group’s approach to remuneration, which takes 
into account best practice and market trends while continuing to support 
the commercial needs of the Group, the interests of shareholders  
and of all other stakeholders. The Committee continues to place great 
importance on ensuring that there is a clear link between pay and 
performance, including a focus on culture, adherence to the Group’s  
risk framework, and that our remuneration outcomes are reflective of 
this wider context. 

Finally, I would like to reiterate my thanks to Cressida Hogg for the 
significant contribution she has made during her tenure as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and for supporting me with the transition 
process. I would also like to thank my fellow Committee members and 
all internal and external stakeholders for their valuable input over the 
course of the year. We look forward to your support of our proposals  
at the forthcoming AGM.

Remuneration at a glance 

Broader employee reward at LSEG
The Committee has responsibility for overseeing arrangements for all of our people and reviews broader workforce policies and practices  
in order to support decisions on executive pay. Our single aligned global reward framework was developed to create a transparent,  
performance-driven approach for our Group. This framework helps to unify and drive our organisation forward and is based on the  
following principles: (i) Performance-led; (ii) Competitive; (iii) Transparent and Equitable; and (iv) Inclusive and Consistent.

Salary
How we reward our colleagues
Salaries are normally reviewed annually by taking into account a range of factors and are reflective of individual 
roles, job-related knowledge, skills, commensurate experience, and the wider market.

In 2024, 91% of employees will receive a salary increase. As inflation and cost of living pressures remain high  
in some of LSEG’s key locations, we continue with the principle of allocating proportionately more of our 2024 
salary budget to those most impacted, specifically prioritising those in early career stages in the UK, US and 
countries with the highest inflation. 

For senior career stages, the approach for our 2024 annual salary review is consistent with that taken in the 
2023 review cycle. For the UK and US, increases are focused on those with expanded roles and those whose 
pay is low versus internal peers and/or the external market.

Executive Director alignment
The review of Executive Director 
salaries takes into account the  
same factors considered for the 
wider workforce.

Benefits
How we reward our colleagues
A market-aligned benefits plan is offered in each key country in which we operate. For the UK, a flexible  
benefits plan is offered, in which individuals have certain core benefits (such as private medical, life assurance 
and income protection) together with a cash allowance which can be spent on elective benefits (such as 
additional medical, life or dental cover).

Colleagues receive an annual pension allowance, invested in the Company’s defined contribution plan or 
provided as a cash allowance.

Executive Director alignment
Executive Directors are eligible for  
a range of market-aligned benefits 
and receive a pension allowance  
in line with the wider workforce.

Executive Director alignment
The annual bonus plan for the 
broader employee population 
considers the same performance 
conditions as the Executive 
Directors’ bonus plan and is linked 
to both Group performance and 
individual performance.

Annual bonuses for Executive 
Directors are subject to 40% deferral 
into shares for a period of three years.

Executive Director alignment
Executive Directors are eligible for 
long-term incentive awards (subject 
to stretching performance targets 
over three years). An additional 
two-year post-vesting holding period 
applies to Executive Directors.

Executive Director alignment
Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate in LSEG’s all-employee 
share plans on the same terms as  
all other eligible employees.

Bonus
How we reward our colleagues
80% of colleagues participate in LSEG’s annual performance-related bonus based on Group, divisional  
(where applicable) and personal performance against goals. Remaining colleagues participate in other 
performance-based plans such as sales incentives.

Annual bonuses for Group leaders are subject to 40% deferral into shares, vesting in equal tranches over  
three years. 

Share incentive plans
How we reward our colleagues
Performance share awards (subject to stretching performance targets over three years) are granted to  
senior leaders who have the ability to significantly influence the long-term performance of the Group.

Group Directors are eligible for restricted share awards aligned with long-term Group performance and 
shareholder interests; vesting in equal tranches over three years.

LSEG employee share plans
How we reward our colleagues
Our all-employee share plans offer employees around the globe the opportunity to invest and share in the  
Group’s future success. All permanent UK and Sri Lanka employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave 
Plan (or, in the case of Sri Lankan employees, an equivalent international plan). There is also a SharePurchase 
Plan, which is designed to provide share options to people who are not based in the UK or Sri Lanka.

In 2023, we have reinforced the benefits of share ownership throughout the organisation by enhancing the 
value of our all-employee plans (doubling the SharePurchase benefit and increasing the contribution cap on  
the Sharesave plan), ensuring an opportunity increase for all. 

Following rollout of the upgraded plans, participation has increased by 19.6% with over 7,600 employees across 
31 countries enrolled in our all-employee plans. LSEG now has more employees participating in all-employee 
share plans than total employee numbers prior to the transaction with Refinitiv.

Operation of 2024 incentive plans and alignment to strategy
The performance measures used in our incentives are directly aligned to the Group’s KPIs and strategic priorities. 

FY2024 Group Bonus Pool
Reflecting shareholder feedback received during the Policy review, the 2024 design includes increasing the weighting of financial measures 
within the bonus pool from 60% to 75%, incorporating both AOP and Future Growth measures. AOP is a key profitability measure for the 
Group and continues to be the main financial measure for annual bonus plan purposes. The additional measure “Future Growth” focuses on 
achievement of future revenue targets. The Group Strategic Objectives focus on the delivery of key strategic objectives, measured through 
achievement of stretching targets against externally reported KPIs.

Remuneration Policy Report

Our Remuneration Policy was last subject to a binding shareholder vote 
at the 2023 AGM and was passed with 97.5% support. This section sets 
out our revised Policy which will be subject to shareholder approval at 
the AGM in April 2024, and if approved, will apply for a period of up to 
three years.

Remuneration Policy table
The revised Policy is set out in the table on pages 129 to 131 and 
includes the following changes to our existing Policy. The rationale  
for the proposed changes is provided in the Statement by the Chair  
of the Remuneration Committee, set out on pages 118 to 123.

Policy element Revision

Annual bonus

 — Increase maximum opportunity from 225% to 300% of 

salary for the CEO. CFO opportunity to remain 
unchanged at 200% of salary.

 — Reduce deferral from 50% to 40% to align with recent 
change applicable below Board level and to align total 
target in-year cash to around the median of global sector 
peers, who do not typically operate bonus deferral.

 — Re-weight Executive Director bonuses to comprise at 
least 70% financials (currently at least 50% under  
existing Policy and 60% in practice for FY2023).

Long-term 
incentives

 — Increase long-term incentive opportunity (granted under 
the EIP) from 300% to 550% of salary for CEO, and to 
400% for CFO.

 — Leaver provisions updated to provide sufficient 

discretion for RemCo to apply ‘good leaver’ status in  
the event of retirement from professional career or to 
work in a governmental capacity or for a non-profit 
organisation, and with agreement from the Company/
Remuneration Committee.

Shareholding 
requirements

 — Increase shareholding requirement from 400% to 600% 
of salary for CEO, and from 300% to 400% of salary for 
CFO, i.e. to be at least equal to the annual long-term 
incentive opportunity.

The Remuneration Policy is designed to support the long-term interests 
of the Group. The Group is committed to paying for performance, 
rewarding the senior management team only when performance against 
stretching targets is achieved. Each year the remuneration framework 
and the packages of the Executive Directors and members of the 
Executive Committee are reviewed by the Committee to ensure that 
they continue to achieve this objective. 

The Committee takes into account multiple reference points when 
setting pay including our global sector peer set for Executive Directors 
and Executive Committee members where available; and with FTSE 30 
practices guiding the structure of pay. When this data is not readily 
available, other reference points such as the FTSE 100 and the broader 
Financial Services/international exchange groups and financial markets 
infrastructure sectors are considered. 

The Committee takes the following areas into account when reviewing 
the policy:
 — a focus on shareholder value;
 — the size, scope and complexity of the Group;
 — the performance of the Group and market positioning against 

appropriate comparators, including sector peers and companies in 
the FTSE 30;

 — the need to attract and retain senior management from the global 

market in which we compete for talent;
 — corporate governance developments;
 — remuneration arrangements for the wider workforce;
 — the Group’s intent to be mindful of best practice as expressed by 
institutional shareholders and their representative bodies; and

 — the unique position of the Group at the centre of global  

financial markets.

Remuneration Policy Report continued

The principles prescribed by the UK Corporate Governance Code are taken into account by the Committee in determining the Remuneration Policy. 
Details of how these are addressed are provided below.

Principle

How the Committee has addressed the principles

Clarity

 — The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration arrangements in the policy are transparent, comprising elements that are commonplace 

in the market and best practice remuneration provisions.

 — The Committee is committed to transparent and constructive engagement with all its stakeholders and consults with major shareholders 
and investor bodies to ensure the rationale for any significant changes proposed to the operation of the policy is fully understood and 
provide the opportunity for feedback to inform our decision-making process.

Simplicity

 — The operation of the Annual Bonus and the design of plans like the EIP is well understood by stakeholders and aligned to Group strategy 

and the UK market best practice approach.

Risk

 — The Committee is satisfied that the policy ensures that the risks from excessive rewards and target-based incentive plans are  

mitigated by:
 — Setting defined limits on the maximum awards which can be earned
 — Ensuring stretching yet achievable targets are set for incentive plans
 — Requiring the deferral of a substantial proportion of the incentives into shares for a material period of time
 — Aligning the performance conditions of incentives with the strategy and business model of the Group
 — Ensuring the Committee has overriding discretion to depart from formulaic outcomes and the ability to apply malus and clawback to 

incentives where appropriate

 — The Remuneration Committee also receives input from the Risk Committee with regard to performance related to risk culture  

(awareness, transparency and accountability) when assessing remuneration decisions.

Predictability

 — Illustrations of the potential outcomes under the Policy are provided on page 136. Defined limits on the maximum awards which can be 
earned are also disclosed on pages 130 and 131. Vesting levels are driven by performance outcomes against stretching targets that are 
set for incentive plans.

Proportionality

 — In line with our pay for performance model, the majority of Executive Director pay is performance-based. The performance metrics used 

Alignment  
to culture

in our incentive plans support the delivery of the Group’s strategy, as well as short-term and long-term financial targets.

 — Relevant market peers are used to assess business performance and inform reward.
 — A robust target-setting process is carried out each year, taking into account internal and external forecasts and reference points, to 

ensure stretching yet achievable targets are set for incentive plans.

 — The Committee also has overriding discretion to adjust incentive outcomes based on a broad set of factors to ensure they fairly and 

accurately reflect the Group’s performance over the relevant period and wider circumstances.

 — The Group bonus pool assessment will continue to be based on the achievement of financial and strategic goals of the Group,  

including cultural and ESG objectives.

 — The Committee places great importance on ensuring our pay policies and incentives support the desired culture and behaviours of the 
Group. Personal performance is assessed against contribution to the strategic objectives, including cultural objectives, and against 
role-related goals and expected behaviours, taking into account both what has been achieved and how the individuals achieved  
their targets.

 — All awards are discretionary and contingent on the requisite standards of personal behaviours; poor behaviour/risk management  

could result in a zero payout. 

The Committee recognises and manages any conflict of interest when receiving views from Executive Directors or senior management on executive 
remuneration and no individual is involved in deciding their own remuneration.

Policy table for Executive Directors

Salary 

Benefits

Purpose and link to strategy
Provides a core element of remuneration which reflects the responsibilities 
of the role.

Purpose and link to strategy
Provides local market-competitive benefits and support the wellbeing  
of employees. 

Enables the recruitment and retention of individuals of the calibre required 
to execute the Group’s strategy.

Operation
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually by taking into account  
a range of factors, including:
 — size and scope of the role;
 — size, complexity and global breadth of the organisation;
 — skills and experience of the individual;
 — market competitiveness/relative positioning;
 — performance of the Group and of the individual;
 — wider market and economic conditions; and
 — level of increases being made across the Group.

Maximum Opportunity
There is no defined maximum salary but the maximum salary for a given 
executive is set by the Committee.

Increases are determined based on the factors described above. 

Operation
A market-aligned benefits plan is offered in each key country in which we 
operate. For the UK, a flexible benefits plan is offered, in which individuals 
have certain core benefits (such as private medical, life assurance and 
income protection) together with a taxable cash allowance which can be 
spent on elective benefits (such as additional medical, life or dental cover).

Car transportation may also be provided for Executive Directors  
where appropriate.

Due to the high profile of the Group, the Committee reserves the right to 
provide our executives with the appropriate level of security arrangements 
to allow them to perform their duties in the safest possible conditions.

Benefits are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain affordable and 
competitive. The Committee retains the discretion to provide additional 
benefits as appropriate – for example, relocation and other allowances 
including expatriate assistance, housing and school fees for a finite period, 
tax preparation and filing assistance and return flights back to the home 
country for the executive and their family. Repatriation costs are met by  
the Company if employment is terminated by the Company, other than  
for just cause.

Where necessary any benefits may be grossed up for taxes.

Executives are eligible to participate in the Group’s HMRC tax favoured 
Sharesave Plan (or international equivalent) on the same basis as  
other employees. 

Executive Directors are covered by the Directors’ and Officers’ insurance 
and indemnification.

Maximum Opportunity
There is no defined maximum. 

Benefits plans are set at (what are in the Committee’s opinion) reasonable 
levels in order to be market competitive for their local jurisdiction and are 
dependent on individual circumstances.

Participation in the Save As You Earn Option Scheme (or international 
equivalent) is capped at the same level as all other participants, which is 
determined by the Company within the parameters of applicable legislation.

Retirement Benefits

Annual Bonus

Purpose and link to strategy
Provides executives with retirement benefits.

Supports recruitment and retention of high-calibre people.

Operation
Provision of annual pension allowance, invested in the Company’s defined 
contribution plan or taken or provided as a cash allowance.

In certain jurisdictions, more bespoke pension arrangements may be 
provided. In such circumstances, the Committee will give appropriate 
consideration to local employment legislation, local market practices  
and the cost of the arrangement.

Maximum Opportunity
The maximum annual pension contribution/cash allowance for Executive 
Directors is 10% of salary (except where required by local market practice 
where levels could be set at a higher or lower amount). This is a rate  
aligned with the wider workforce in the UK.

Performance Measures
n/a

Purpose and link to strategy
Rewards annual performance against challenging financial, strategic  
and individual targets linked to Group strategy.

Deferral into shares reinforces retention and enhances alignment with 
shareholders by encouraging longer-term focus and sustainable performance.

Operation
The Group operates a Group-wide bonus pool which is funded based on 
the achievement of financial and strategic goals of the Group. Allocations  
to individual Executive Directors are made from this pool based on the 
Committee’s assessment of their personal performance, taking into account 
the Group’s financial and strategic performance and the achievement of  
any personal objectives related to their role.

Performance targets are reviewed and set by the Committee at the 
beginning of each performance year.

Awards are determined by the Committee after the year-end based upon 
the actual performance against these targets. 

The Committee applies judgement where necessary to ensure approved 
pay-out levels are reflective of actual, overall performance and has the 
ability to exercise discretion in adjusting the formulaic outcome of incentives 
to ensure the outcome is reflective of the performance of the Company and 
the individual over the period.
 — 40% of the annual bonus will be subject to mandatory deferral, normally 

for a period of three years. 

 — Bonus deferral will be 100% into shares. 
 — Dividends (or equivalents) may be paid in respect of deferred shares  

on vesting.

 — Unvested deferred awards are subject to malus provisions as described 

below. Paid bonuses and vested deferred awards are subject to clawback 
as described below.

Maximum Opportunity
Maximum annual bonus opportunity of 300% of salary for CEO and 200%  
of salary for other Executive Directors.

Performance Measures
Based on a combination of financial (e.g. adjusted operating profit and future 
growth), strategic and personal performance targets. Strategic objectives 
include key targets and areas of focus, which are set annually, and 
measured through achievement of stretching targets against externally 
reported KPIs. Whilst not an exclusive list, examples of strategic objectives 
can include culture, resilience, customer, efficiency, and sustainability. These 
strategic objectives also impact on financial results in the medium term. 

The Committee will set the detail and mix of performance measures, targets 
and weighting based on the strategic objectives at the start of each year.  
At least 70% of the annual bonus pool and Executive Directors’ bonuses  
will be based on performance against financial measures.

No bonuses are paid for below threshold performance. The Committee  
may award any amount between zero and 100% of the maximum opportunity.

Long-term incentives (under Long Term Incentive Plan  
2014 and Equity Incentive Plan)

Share ownership

Purpose and link to strategy
Incentivises performance over the longer term through the award of 
performance-related shares.

Aligns reward with long-term, sustainable Group performance and  
a focus on shareholder value.

Operation
 — Awards of shares (or equivalent) are granted annually (to be granted 

under the EIP from 2024 onwards).

 — Awards vest subject to performance targets assessed over a 

performance period, normally of at least three financial years with an 
additional holding period of two years. The Committee has discretion  
to set different performance periods and holding periods if it considers 
them to be appropriate. 

 — The Committee shall determine the extent to which the performance 
measures have been met. The Committee may make adjustments to 
performance targets if an event occurs which makes, at the Committee’s 
determination, an adjustment appropriate. The performance targets will 
be at least as challenging as the ones originally set.

 — The Committee has the ability to exercise discretion in adjusting the 

formulaic outcome of incentives to ensure the outcome is reflective of  
the performance of the Company and the individual over the period.

 — Dividends (or equivalents) may be awarded on vesting. Unvested awards 

are subject to a malus provision and vested awards are subject to 
clawback, as described below.

Purpose and link to strategy
Ensures alignment with shareholders’ interests.

Operation
Executive Directors are expected to build up share ownership over a period 
of five years from appointment. The minimum shareholding requirement is 
600 per cent of base salary for the CEO and 400 per cent of base salary for 
other Executive Directors. 

Executive Directors are expected to hold 100% of their minimum 
shareholding requirement for two years post-departure. 

In cases where the individual has not had sufficient time to build up  
share ownership to meet the minimum shareholding requirement,  
the post-employment shareholding requirement will be based on their 
actual level of shareholding on departure.

The Committee has discretion to vary or waive part or all of the post-
employment shareholding requirement in exceptional circumstances.

Maximum Opportunity
Maximum awards of up to 550% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer  
and 400% of salary for other Executive Directors.

Maximum Opportunity
N/a

Performance Measures
The Committee determines performance targets each year to ensure that 
the targets are stretching and support value creation for shareholders while 
remaining motivational for management. 

Vesting of awards is subject to achievement of total shareholder return  
and other financial performance targets. Any one measure will not exceed 
two-thirds of the award. 

For each performance element, achievement of the threshold performance 
level will result in no more than 25 per cent of the maximum award paying 
out. For achievement of the maximum performance level, 100% of the 
maximum pays out. Normally, there is straight-line vesting between  
these points.

Notes to the Policy Table
Selection of performance measures
Performance targets are set by the Committee to be both stretching and 
achievable, taking into account the Group’s strategic priorities and the 
economic landscape.

The performance measures that are used for our annual bonus  
and long-term incentive awards have been chosen to support the 
Group’s strategy. For the annual bonus plan, the Committee continues  
to believe that it is appropriate to use a balance between financial 
targets, strategic objectives and personal performance objectives.

Performance Measures
N/a

The Committee considers that the measures to be used for long-term 
incentive awards going forwards, i.e. relative TSR against sector peers 
and the FTSE 100 index, and adjusted EPS, are currently the most 
appropriate measures of long-term performance for the Group. The 
Committee reviews the measures, weightings and targets for long-term 
incentive awards on an annual basis, to ensure their continued suitability 
and to ensure they are sufficiently stretching for LSEG.

Malus and clawback provisions
Malus and clawback provisions apply to all share incentive awards 
granted to Executive Directors. Clawback provisions apply to annual 
bonuses paid to Executive Directors.

In respect of future awards under the EIP, the malus provisions allow  
the Committee in its absolute discretion to determine, at any time prior 
to the payment or vesting of an award, to reduce, cancel or impose 
further conditions in certain circumstances, including; 

(a)  material misstatement or restatement in the Company’s or any 
member of the Group’s audited financial accounts (other than  
as a result of a change in accounting practice);

(b)  the negligence, fraud or serious misconduct of an individual,  

or fraud or serious misconduct with the knowledge of a participant;

(c)  conduct by an individual which results in, or is or was reasonably 

likely to result in (whether or not such result has transpired  
e.g., if undiscovered and/or if no mitigating steps had been taken):
(i)  significant reputational damage to the Company, any member  
of the Group or to a relevant business unit (as appropriate);

(ii)  a material adverse effect on the financial position of the 

Company, any member of the Group or to a relevant business 
unit (as appropriate); 

(iii)  a material downturn in the financial performance of the 

Company, any member of the Group or to a relevant business 
unit (as appropriate);

(iv)  a material corporate failure of the Company, any member of  
the Group or to a relevant business unit (as appropriate);
(v)  a material adverse effect on the business opportunities and 
prospects for sustained performance or profitability of the 
Company, any member of the Group or relevant business unit  
(as appropriate); or

(vi)  a material failure of risk management in the Company,  

any member of the Group or to a relevant business unit  
(as appropriate),

or an individual being (or having been): a member of; an employee 
of; or responsible for, a business unit, the Company or a member of 
the Group that suffers (or may or could reasonably have suffered) 
any of the same;

(d)  where the grant, vesting, exercise, payment or release of an award 
would not be sustainable according to the financial situation of the 
Group as a whole nor justified on the basis of the performance of  
the Group, the relevant business unit and the relevant individual;

(e)  conduct or behaviour by an individual that, following an investigation, 
is reasonably considered by the Committee to constitute a breach of 
the Company’s values and/or standards as stipulated by the Group’s 
Code of Conduct or any of the Company’s policies, procedures or 
any provision of any staff handbook in force from time to time;

(i)  any other circumstances that the Committee, in exercising 

appropriate discretion and acting fairly and reasonably, considers to 
be similar in nature or effect to those above.

Clawback provisions allow the Committee in its absolute discretion to 
claw back from individuals some or all of the vested EIP awards or  
paid bonus in the same circumstances outlined for malus above. 

Clawback will normally apply for a period of three years following 
vesting of share awards and/or payment of cash bonus unless the 
Committee determines otherwise.

Similar but not identical malus and/or clawback triggers apply to existing 
awards under other LSEG discretionary share incentive plans, and to 
annual bonuses.

Freezing provisions
Under the EIP, the Committee may also exercise its discretion to “freeze” 
an award (e.g. suspend grant, vesting, exercise or delivery of an award): 

(a)  where an individual is subject to any investigation, disciplinary 

process or disciplinary sanction; 

(b)  any circumstances in which the Committee may apply its discretion 

to apply malus/clawback (as explained above); or 

(c)  in any other circumstances that the Committee, in exercising its 

discretion and acting fairly and reasonably, considers appropriate. 

Recruitment policy
When determining the remuneration package for a newly appointed 
Executive Director, the Committee would seek to apply the following 
principles:
 — The package should be market competitive to facilitate the 

recruitment of individuals of sufficient calibre required by the Group. 
Consistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee 
would intend to pay no more than it believes is necessary to secure 
the required talent.

 — The ongoing remuneration package would normally include the key 
elements on the same terms as those set out in the policy table for 
Executive Directors.

 — The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be awarded 
on recruitment (excluding any buy-outs referred to below) is 850% of 
salary. Incentive awards made in the first year of appointment may be 
subject to different performance measures and targets appropriate  
to the newly recruited Executive Director.

 — Recognising that the Group competes for talent in the international 
financial services sector, on an exceptional basis, the Committee  
has the ability to include other elements of pay which it feels  
are appropriate taking into account the specific commercial 
circumstances (e.g., for an interim appointment). However, this  
would remain subject to the limit on variable remuneration set  
out above. The rationale for any such component would be 
appropriately disclosed.

(f)  unreasonable failure by an individual to protect the interests of the 

 — In addition, where an individual forfeits arrangements as a result of 

Group’s stakeholders; 

(g)  where a participant ceases to be an employee by reason of their 
retirement (as determined by the Committee) at any time prior to 
payment or vesting, but becomes employed in an executive role by 
any entity other than a role for which they receive no remuneration;

(h)  an error in assessing any performance conditions applicable to an 

award or in the information or assumptions on which the award was 
granted, vests or is exercised, paid or released; or

appointment, the Committee may offer a buy-out, in such form as the 
Committee considers appropriate taking into account all relevant 
factors which may include the vehicle, expected value and timing  
of forfeited opportunities. Any such buy-out will be limited to the 
commercial value of payments and awards forfeited by the individual.

 — Where an Executive Director is required to relocate from their home 
location to take up their role, the Committee may provide reasonable 
relocation assistance and other allowances including expatriate 
assistance. Global relocation support (normally for up to five years) 
and any associated costs or benefits (including but not limited to 
housing, school fees, tax preparation and filing assistance and flights 
back to the home country) may also be provided if business needs 
require it. Should the executive’s employment be terminated without 
cause by the Group, repatriation costs will be met by the Group.
 — In the event that an internal candidate is promoted to the Board, 

legacy terms and conditions would normally be honoured, including 
pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards.

 — The remuneration package for a newly appointed Non-Executive 
Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the 
policy table for Non-Executive Directors (see page 135).

Service contracts and payments for departing Directors
The Group’s current policy is that Executive Directors’ service 
agreements should have notice periods that are no longer than  
12 months. The Group may terminate an Executive Director’s service 
agreement by making a payment in lieu of notice of a sum equal to 
salary, pension, flexible benefits allowance, and life and medical 
insurance (but excluding bonus and share incentives) in respect of  
any unexpired period of notice, plus any accrued unused holiday 
entitlement. Consideration will be given to appropriate mitigation terms 
(including payments in instalments) to reduce payments in lieu of notice 
made on termination in the event of the Executive Director commencing 
alternative employment, being appointed as a Non-Executive Director  
or providing services pursuant to a consultancy agreement in the  
period that would have been served as notice following the Executive 
Director’s departure.

Treatment of variable incentives
Annual bonus 
Individuals may be considered for an annual bonus in respect of the 
period prior to cessation. Any award would be at the discretion of the 
Committee, subject to the Executive Director’s performance and period 
of employment and subject to performance targets in the usual way.

Deferred Bonus Plan
For good leavers, awards will usually vest at the normal vesting date, 
although the Committee may determine that awards vest on cessation 
of employment. Awards will normally vest in full for a good leaver,  
but the Committee has discretion to pro-rate the award if appropriate  
to do so. If the vesting of a good leaver’s award(s) is required to be 
accelerated due to local law requirements (including tax law), the 
Committee would ordinarily impose a post-vesting holding period on  
the resulting net-of-tax shares for the balance of the original vesting 
period, during which the leaver would not be permitted to sell or transfer 
those shares. Good leavers are those who cease to be an employee of 
a member of the Group by reason of death, injury, disability, ill-health, 
redundancy, the sale of the individual’s employing business or the 
transfer of the Company out of the Group, or any other reason which  
the Committee decides in its discretion (having regard to a range of 
relevant factors including the Executive Director’s performance, length 
of service and circumstances of their departure), and retirement from  
a professional career or to work in a governmental capacity or for  
a non-profit organisation and with agreement from the Company/
Committee will also be an express good leaver reason.

Where an individual is not considered to be a good leaver, unvested 
awards will lapse. Where an individual is summarily dismissed, all awards 
will lapse.

The Group may pay an Executive Director’s reasonable legal fees for 
receiving advice in connection with their employment or its termination.

Deferred unvested awards are subject to malus and vested awards are 
subject to clawback.

The lawful termination mechanisms described above are without 
prejudice to the Group’s ability in appropriate circumstances to 
terminate in breach of the notice period referred to above, and thereby 
to be liable for damages to the Executive Director. Liquidated damages 
clauses are not used.

In the event of termination by the Group, an Executive Director may  
be paid an amount in respect of any statutory and/or contractual  
claims they may have in connection with their employment and/or  
its termination. Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance and an 
indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the Group’s 
Articles of Association are provided to the Executive Directors for  
the duration of their employment and for a minimum of seven years 
following termination.

The Committee considers that this is consistent with current best 
practice and this approach will generally be adopted for new 
appointments. Where appropriate and when recruiting non-UK based 
Directors, the Committee may agree different terms based on local  
legal requirements or market practice.

Long Term Incentive Plan 2014/Equity Incentive Plan
For good leavers, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date 
and following the end of the performance period, unless the Committee 
determines that awards should vest following cessation of employment. 
The two-year post-vesting holding period following the end of the 
performance period will normally continue to apply unless the 
Committee determines otherwise. If the vesting of a good leaver’s 
award(s) is required to be accelerated due to local law requirements 
(including tax law), the Committee would ordinarily impose a post-
vesting holding period on the resulting net-of-tax shares for the balance 
of the original vesting period, during which the leaver would not be 
permitted to sell or transfer those shares. Vesting will be subject to 
performance and unless the Committee determines otherwise (or that 
another basis of reduction is appropriate) pro-rated for time in 
employment. Good leavers are those who cease to be an employee of 
a member of the Group by reason of death, injury, disability, ill-health, 
redundancy, and the sale of the individual’s employing business or 
transfer of the Company out of the Group, any other reason which the 
Committee decides in its discretion, having regard to a range of relevant 
factors including the Executive Director’s performance, length of service 
and circumstances of their departure, and (in the case of the Equity 
Incentive Plan) retirement from professional career or to work in  
a governmental capacity or for a non-profit organisation and with 
agreement from the Company/Committee is also now included as  
an express good leaver reason.

Where an individual is not considered to be a good leaver, unvested 
awards will lapse.

Unvested awards are subject to malus and vested awards are subject to 
clawback as detailed above.

Buy-out awards
If a departing Executive Director holds a buy-out award granted to  
them in connection with their appointment, that award will be treated  
in accordance with its terms.

Detailed share plan provisions
Share awards are subject to the terms of the relevant plan rules under 
which the award has been granted. The Committee may adjust or 
amend awards only in accordance with the provisions of the plan rules. 
This includes making adjustments to awards to reflect certain corporate 
events, including a variation in the Company’s share capital, a demerger 
or a special dividend. In change of control circumstances, all LTIP and 
EIP awards will normally vest on an accelerated basis to the extent that 
the performance conditions are satisfied, and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, subject to time pro-rating. Deferred Bonus 
awards will normally vest in full. The Committee may also allow or 
require some or all of an award to be exchanged if not yet vested.

Individual terms
David Schwimmer entered into a service agreement with the Group on 
12 April 2018 and was appointed with effect from 1 August 2018. David 
Schwimmer’s service agreement may be terminated by either party 
giving at least 12 months’ notice. Alternatively, the Group may terminate 
the contract by payment in lieu of notice of a sum equal to 12 months’ 
salary, pension, flexible benefits allowance, and life and private medical 
insurance (but excluding bonus, share incentives and car transportation). 
Any payment in lieu of notice will be paid in equal monthly instalments 
from the date of termination of the employment. Should Mr Schwimmer 
commence alternative employment, be appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director or provide services pursuant to a consultancy agreement in the 
relevant period (of 12 months) following his departure from the Group, 
each remaining instalment will be reduced by one-twelfth of the annual 
remuneration earned from the alternative employment, directorship or 
consultancy arrangement. Payments of the instalments may be required 
to be deferred until six months after termination by US tax rules applying 
to Mr Schwimmer. To the extent that any payment or benefits payable  
to Mr Schwimmer under his service agreement or under any bonus or 
share incentive plan would be subject to US excise tax, the payments 
and benefits may be reduced if this would result in Mr Schwimmer 
receiving a greater after-tax amount than if the benefits were not 
reduced. On termination (other than by reason of summary dismissal)  
Mr Schwimmer will be eligible to receive a pro-rata bonus for the  
year in which his employment is terminated subject to Group and 
personal performance.

Michel-Alain Proch entered into a service agreement with the  
Group dated 1 November 2023 and was appointed with effect from  
26 February 2024. Michel-Alain Proch’s service agreement may be 
terminated by either party giving at least 12 months’ notice. Alternatively, 
the Group may terminate the contract by payment in lieu of notice of a 
sum equal to 12 months’ salary, pension, wellbeing and flexible benefits 
allowance, and life and private medical insurance (but excluding bonus 
and share incentives). Any payment in lieu of notice will be paid in equal 
monthly instalments from the date of termination of the employment. 
Should Mr Proch commence alternative employment, be appointed as  
a Non-Executive Director or provide services pursuant to a consultancy 
agreement in the relevant period (of 12 months) following his departure 
from the Group, each remaining instalment will be reduced by one-
twelfth of the annual remuneration earned from the alternative 
employment, directorship or consultancy arrangement. On termination 
(other than by reason of summary dismissal) Mr Proch will be eligible  
to receive a pro-rata bonus for the year in which his employment is 
terminated subject to Group and personal performance.

Remuneration policy for other employees and consideration
of wider employee remuneration
The Committee has responsibility for overseeing arrangements for all 
employees and reviews broader workforce policies and practices in 
order to support decisions on executive pay.

Paying our employees fairly relative to their role, skills, experience and 
performance is central to our approach to remuneration, and our reward 
framework and policies support us in doing this. Our Group-wide reward 
framework establishes a transparent and robust compensation structure, 
elements and leverage for each career stage in the organisation, 
providing the Committee with oversight of workforce remuneration.

The Committee places great importance on ensuring our pay policies 
and incentives support the desired culture and behaviours of the Group. 
As detailed in the “Annual bonus operation” section on page 143, bonus 
awards for our Group Executive team as well as our Executive Directors 
are determined in accordance with performance against Group financial 
performance, Group strategic objectives and personal objectives. This 
provides the Committee with greater structure in determining the bonus 
of senior management as well as allowing for a greater focus on culture 
and behaviours.

The Remuneration Policy for senior executives and other employees  
is determined based on similar principles to Executive Directors.  
For roles below the main Board, the exact structure and balance  
are tailored based on various factors including the scale, scope or 
responsibility of the role, development within a role and/or significant 
market movement. The Committee reviews and comments on the salary, 
bonus and long-term incentive awards of the senior executives 
immediately below Board level and approves the overall design and 
distribution of incentive awards available to all employees, including 
share-based plans.

The approach in respect of base salary and benefits is generally 
consistent across the organisation. Executive Directors’ and other  
senior managers’ remuneration includes a greater proportion of 
performance-related pay when compared to other employees.  
The Committee considers this is essential to differentiate levels of 
responsibility and align pay to sustainable long-term performance  
and shareholders’ interests.

The majority of employees are eligible to participate in the annual  
bonus plan which is subject to similar metrics to those used for the 
Executive Directors. Opportunities vary by career stage. Employees  
not participating in the annual bonus typically participate in another 
incentive plan. For example, some sales employees participate in sales 
compensation plans rather than the annual bonus plan.

Deferral of a portion of the annual bonus is operated for our Executive 
Director, Group Executive and Group Leader populations. 40% of the 
annual bonus for our Executive Directors is deferred into shares for a 
period of three years. Below Board, our Group Executives and Group 
Leaders defer 40% of their annual bonus, normally vesting in equal 
tranches over three years; for participants in the Co-invest Plan, their 
deferred bonus vests after three years. Participants in the Co-invest  
Plan invest their deferred bonus into shares and receive a 2:1 company 
match; performance measures and vesting on the match mirror those of 
long-term incentive awards. The operation of bonus deferral reinforces 
the alignment of the pay of our senior employees with shareholder 
interests and the Group’s long-term performance.

Malus and clawback provisions apply to all awards granted under 
discretionary share incentive plans.

In setting remuneration for Executive Directors, the Committee  
considers the overall approach to rewarding employees across  
the Group taking into account performance, the complexity, scale,  
scope or responsibility of the role, development within a role and/or 
significant market movement.

Consideration of shareholders’ views
The Committee is mindful of shareholder views when setting  
and evaluating ongoing remuneration principles and commits to 
consulting with shareholders prior to any significant changes to the 
Remuneration Policy.

We have held briefings with People Leaders and Executive Committee 
members to explain changes to the Reward Framework and alignment 
with the Executive Director Remuneration Policy. While employees are 
not directly consulted on the development of the Remuneration Policy 
for Executive Directors, employee forums held in key regional locations 
give employees the opportunity to provide feedback and express their 
views on any topic including executive remuneration.

The Committee receives ongoing regulatory updates and information  
on external market practices from its independent external advisers who 
provide additional context for decisions.

In formulating the revised 2024 Policy, we consulted extensively with 
nearly 100 shareholders, representing approximately 80% of LSEG’s 
voting rights, and proxy agencies. We are grateful for the valuable input 
provided by everyone we engaged with during this process, which 
informed the detail of our revised Policy. Overall, the majority of 
shareholders were supportive of our proposals and recognised  
the rationale of our thinking in light of the transformation and high 
performance of the business, both in absolute and relative terms,  
under our CEO’s leadership, and the need for LSEG to compete  
in a global talent market. 

Policy for Non-Executive Directors

Approach to setting fees

Basis of fees

Other items

The fees for Non-Executive Directors are set at a level which is considered 
appropriate to attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability 
to make an important contribution to the Group’s affairs.

The Chair’s fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee, and the 
Board is responsible for determining all other Non-Executive Director fees.

Fees are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain appropriate in the 
context of: the role scope; company size, complexity and global breadth; 
and wider market conditions. The Committee retains the flexibility to 
increase, adjust and make one-off payments to Non-Executive Directors 
based on their remit.

Fees are set taking into account the level of responsibility of each 
Non-Executive Director and fees at other companies of a similar size  
and complexity.

The aggregate basic fees payable to all Non-Executives combined 
(excluding fees as Chair and excluding fees paid for any appointments  
on subsidiary boards) are capped as set out in the Group’s Articles of 
Association as they may be amended by a resolution of shareholders  
from time to time. The current limit on the aggregate basic fees that are 
payable is £1,500,000 per financial year.

Non-Executive Directors receive  
a basic annual fee with additional 
fees payable for services such as 
committee chairmanship.

Non-Executive Directors are also 
entitled to receive fees from 
subsidiary companies if appointed  
to such boards.

The Non-Executive Chair of the 
Group receives an all-inclusive fee  
for the role.

Fees are neither performance-related 
nor pensionable.

Non-Executive Directors are not 
eligible to participate in the annual 
bonus or long-term incentive plans 
and are not entitled to any payments 
on termination.

Non-Executive Directors receive an 
allowance for any Board meeting 
involving intercontinental travel.

Travel and other appropriate 
expenses with associated taxes 
(including fees incurred in obtaining 
professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties) incurred 
in the course of performing  
their duties are reimbursed to 
Non-Executive Directors.

Non-Executive Directors are 
covered by the Directors’  
and Officers’ insurance and 
indemnification.

Non-Executive Directors are 
required to build up share 
ownership of at least 1x basic 
annual fees within three years  
of appointment.

Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with no notice 
period except for the Group Chair who has a notice period of six  
months unless he is not re-elected by shareholders in which case his 
appointment will terminate immediately. The Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointments are for an initial period of three years from the date of 
appointment and are also subject to re-election by shareholders.

Amendments to the Remuneration Policy Report
The Committee remains mindful that regulation of companies in the 
financial services sector continues to evolve. The Committee recognises 
that remuneration arrangements may need to be amended in order  
to comply with any new regulations which become applicable to the 
Group. The Committee reserves the right to make changes to the  
Policy described above in order to comply with any such regulatory 
requirements which apply to the Group including any changes required 
under the UK Corporate Governance Code or for regulatory, exchange 
control, tax or administrative purposes, to take account of a change in 
legislation, or to make minor amendments without obtaining shareholder 
approval for that amendment. Where this results in a major structural 
change, the Committee would expect to present a revised policy to 
shareholders for approval at the following AGM.

Illustration of the application of the Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Directors
The chart on the right illustrates how much the current Executive 
Directors could receive under four different hypothetical performance 
scenarios for the first year of this policy taking effect i.e. 2024: minimum, 
mid-range, maximum and maximum assuming a 50% increase in share 
price for long-term incentive awards during the vesting period. It is 
important to highlight that the full impacts of the policy proposals will  
not be realised until 2029 when the 2024 long-term incentive award is 
released from the holding period, should stretching performance  
targets be met.

Notes to the table:
1  The value delivered through performance is calculated as the number of shares forecast to vest in 2024 multiplied by the share price on the date of grant. The value delivered through share 

price growth is calculated as the same number of shares multiplied by the difference between the average share price in the last three months of the financial year, being £86.34, and the share 
price on the date of grant, being £70.62. The Committee does not intend to amend the outcome or make any adjustments in regard to share price growth over the period, on the basis that this 
reflects our view of the Group’s underlying performance and returns for shareholders over the performance period.

2  Performance shares vested at 82% on 22 April 2023 at £80.84 per share.

David Schwimmer
3  Benefits include the cash value of private medical, income protection and life assurance plus expatriate allowances (including flight allowance which ceased on 31 December 2023) and 

commuting expenses (including car transportation where appropriate) with associated taxes. David Schwimmer contributed £500 per month to the 2020 SAYE plan until it matured on 1 June 2023 
and contributes £500 per month into the 2023 SAYE scheme which will mature in November 2026 with a six-month exercise window; these benefits have been valued based on the  
20% discount to market value on the SAYE option exercise price.

Anna Manz
4  Benefits include the cash value of private medical, income protection and life assurance plus commuting expenses (including car transportation where appropriate) with associated taxes. 

Further notes
There were no money or assets reported in any previous financial year that were subject to a recovery of sums paid or withholding during the year.

Payments for loss of office
No payments were made for loss of office during the year. 

Payments to past Directors
No payments were made to past Directors during the year.

Retirement benefits
In the UK, pension provision for our Executive Directors takes the form 
of a non-consolidated cash allowance; only base salary is used to 
calculate pension entitlement and no other pension supplements apply. 

David Schwimmer and Anna Manz each received an allowance 
equivalent to 10% of base salary as a taxable cash supplement, which is 
in line with the wider workforce, ensuring we are compliant with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 

Bonus awarded for FY2023
Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual bonus based on 
meeting or exceeding bonus targets that are set at the beginning of  
the year, looking at the Group’s financial performance and strategic 
objectives as well as personal performance.

The Remuneration Committee also receives input from the Risk 
Committee with regard to performance related to risk culture 
(awareness, transparency and accountability) when assessing 
remuneration decisions.

The operation of the FY2023 annual bonus is as per last year. The 
Group bonus pool was assessed 60% against financial performance and 
40% against strategic objectives. The Committee considers AOP to be 
of particular significance for the Group and believes it should continue 
to be the main financial measure for annual bonus plan purposes. The 
maximum bonus opportunity for FY23 was 225% of salary for the CEO 
and 200% of salary for the CFO. 

The Executive Directors’ awards are funded from the Group bonus  
pool. For FY2023 bonus awards for the Executive Directors and  
Group Executive team continue to be determined in accordance with 
performance assessed: 60% against Group AOP; 20% against Group 
strategic objectives; and 20% against personal objectives (including 
divisional objectives where applicable).

Personal performance is assessed against contribution to the strategic 
objectives, including cultural objectives, and against role-related goals 
and expected behaviours, taking into account both what has been 
achieved and how the individuals achieved their targets.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued

Additional notes to the Single total figure of remuneration

Fixed pay
Base salary
When reviewing Executive Director salaries, and in line with our Policy, 
the Committee considers multiple reference points including our sector 
peers and companies in the FTSE 30.

Benefits 
A flexible benefits plan is offered, in which individuals have certain core 
benefits (such as private medical, life assurance and income protection) 
together with (in the UK) a taxable cash allowance which can be spent 
on elective benefits (such as additional medical, life or dental cover). 
Where received as a cash supplement, this allowance is not used to 
calculate bonus payments or pension contributions. 

Benefits are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain affordable and 
competitive. Executives are eligible to participate in the Group’s HMRC 
tax-favoured SAYE Scheme (or international equivalent). There has been 
no change to the provision of benefits and all arrangements below have 
previously been disclosed.

David Schwimmer and Anna Manz receive a flexible benefits allowance 
of £15,000 per annum, which is unchanged from last year. In addition, 
the Executive Directors receive benefits in kind which include private 
health care, permanent health insurance and life assurance 
arrangements. Car transportation is also provided where appropriate.

As an expatriate from the US to UK, David Schwimmer received/receives 
the following:
Expired:
 — For the first five years of employment, an annual allowance of  
up to £50,000 to cover flights between London and the US  
for Mr Schwimmer and his family; this allowance ceased on  
31 December 2023.

Current:
 — Tax preparation and filing assistance in the US and the UK. 
 — The Group will meet the costs of repatriating Mr Schwimmer’s  
effects back to the US if the Group terminates his employment  
other than in circumstances such as serious misconduct which  
would justify termination.

Save As You Earn (SAYE)
David Schwimmer contributed £500 per month into the 2020 SAYE 
scheme which matured in June 2023, and he exercised on 1 June 2023. 
David contributes £500 per month into the 2023 SAYE scheme which 
will mature in November 2026 with a six-month exercise window.

Anna Manz contributed £500 per month into the 2021 SAYE scheme. 
Anna’s 2021 SAYE scheme lapsed upon her leaving date as per the  
plan rules.

Insurance and indemnification 
Executive Directors are covered by the Directors’ and Officers’ 
insurance and indemnification.

Malus and clawback
There are no contractual malus or clawback provisions in place in 
relation to benefits.

Summary assessment of strategic objectives
In determining the overall outcome of the strategic objectives for the FY2023 Group bonus pool, the Committee took into account certain factors 
relating to risk, including compliance risk and resilience, which meant that despite the otherwise strong strategic performance achieved against  
the objectives, the Committee determined that, on balance, the overall outcome of this component should be 28%. This outturn is lower than the 
previous year’s outturn of 31%. Further details of performance against strategic objectives is set out below.

David Schwimmer, 
Chief Executive Officer

 — David Schwimmer has led the Group’s strong performance in an uncertain macroeconomic environment and continues to 

transform our business and deliver on our strategy. He continues to grow the business at a faster rate than it had been, with 
growth for the full year towards the upper end of the +6-8% guidance range. We have established a consistent track-record of 
growth in our Data & Analytics business, with the ongoing improvements to our offering and strengthened customer relationships 
increasingly reflected in financial performance.

 — Under David’s leadership, the company is in a strong position financially; adjusted operating profit was £2.9 billion, up 7.9%  

on a constant currency basis; LSEG remains highly cash-generative and we continue to actively manage our capital allocation. 
The overhang on LSEG shares which was a significant drag at the beginning of the year has been seamlessly reduced with the 
Blackstone Consortium placements during 2023 oversubscribed due to strong demand from investors. The Blackstone holding 
has reduced from over 34% to around 11% over the year. LSEG’s share price closed 2023 at £92.74, +30% on the year, making it 
one of the best performing shares in its global sector peer group.

 — David continues to foster an inclusive culture, setting the tone from the top and introducing a new set of global values across the 
Group. The results of the employee engagement survey were strong at 75% (flat on 2022 and against a global benchmark of 
decline externally) and the participation rate of 88% was the highest it has ever been.

 — David has acted boldly to bring in high-calibre senior talent, making four new ExCo appointments (CIO, CPO, Group Head of D&A 
and Group Head of SAM), with three of these being external recruits. He has also secured a top calibre CFO and hired an Indices 
expert to run B&I.

 — David continues to drive the business forward. The reaction to LSEG’s Capital Markets Day has been positive with clear 

communication of the company’s medium and long-term strategy, including raising of growth-targets, acceleration of delivery  
of Microsoft products and announcement of further returns to shareholders.

 — David has demonstrated a strong track record with LSEG achieving EPS and TSR performance around the upper quartile  

relative to the company’s global sector peer group under his tenure. The feedback received during the Remuneration Policy 
review from LSEG’s top 40 shareholders consistently recognised the importance of his role and transformational leadership  
as a strength for LSEG.

Anna Manz’s personal performance was not subject to assessment for the purposes of the 2023 bonus given her resignation and forfeiture of the award.

Compulsory deferral under existing Remuneration Policy 
Executive Directors must compulsorily defer 50% of their bonus into

equivalents will be paid in respect of deferred shares on vesting.

LTIP Awards granted in April 2020 (vesting in 2023)
The awards granted in 2020 were based on relative TSR performance 
versus the FTSE 100 Index peer group and adjusted EPS performance in 
the 36-month performance period to December 2022. The relative TSR 
element vested at 56% and the AEPS element vested at 100%. These 
vesting outcomes reflect the delivery of significant value and reflects 
AEPS growth of 11% year-on-year and 19% CAGR over the three-year 
performance period; and 13.4% TSR performance over the three-year 
period (4.3% annualised) representing 6th decile performance relative  
to the FTSE 100 peer group. The vesting price at 22 April 2023 was 
£80.84. These values are shown in the single figure table for the 
financial year ending December 2022.

LTIP Awards granted in March 2021 (to vest in 2024)
The AEPS element of the LTIP awards made in 2021 will vest at 100% 
and the Relative TSR element will vest at 0%. These vesting outcomes 
reflect the delivery of AEPS growth of 18.3% CAGR over the three-year 
performance period; and 8.1% TSR performance over the three-year 
performance period (2.6%% annualised), representing 43rd percentile 
performance relative to the FTSE 100 peer group. The TSR position 
partly reflects the significant growth in the share price in the years 
leading up to the start of the 2021 LTIP performance period during  
which LSEG was consistently upper quartile.

The value shown in the single figure table on page 137 for the financial 
year ending December 2023 represents the estimated value of the 
2021 awards which will vest in March 2024. The estimated value 
(including the estimated value of the award that reflects share price 
growth) is based on the average share price in the final three months  
of the financial year (£86.34). The Committee does not intend to amend 
the outcome or make any adjustments in regard to share price growth 
over the period, on the basis that this vesting reflects our view of the 
Group’s underlying performance and returns for shareholders over the 
performance period. The awards are subject to a two-year post-vesting 
holding period.

1  No FY2023 bonus will be awarded to Anna Manz, who resigned as CFO on 25 May 2023 

and left the Group on 29 February 2024.

Other share plans (SAYE, SharePurchase)
All permanent UK employees, including Executive Directors, are eligible 
to participate in the HM Revenue & Customs tax-favoured Save As You 
Earn Scheme (SAYE). Under the rules of the SAYE, participants can save 
up to £500 each month, for a period of three years. At the end of the 
saving period, savings may be used to acquire ordinary shares by 
exercising the related option. The options may be granted at an exercise 
price which represents a discount of up to 20% to market value at the 
date of invitation. No performance conditions are attached to SAYE 
options. Employees in Sri Lanka, including Executive Directors, are 
eligible to participate in an equivalent international SAYE plan.

There is also a SharePurchase Plan, which is designed to provide share 
incentives to all people in our Group, including Executive Directors,  
who are not based in the UK or Sri Lanka. SharePurchase allows eligible 
employees in 29 countries to purchase up to an equivalent of £500  
of LSEG ordinary shares per month, who are then awarded additional 
shares which vest after the completion of a three-year plan cycle.  
No performance conditions are attached to the award. During 2023 we 
launched SharePurchase into nine new countries, meaning that this year 
more than 91% of our employees globally were offered the opportunity 
to benefit from our success and share in LSEG’s future by participating 
in one of our employee share ownership plans.

In 2023, David Schwimmer commenced saving at the maximum of  
£500 per month under the SAYE, and was granted an option on exactly 
the same terms as all other eligible employees. David had previously 
saved into the 2020 SAYE plan at the maximum £500 per month  
and exercised his 2020 SAYE option when it matured in June 2023. 
Anna Manz’s 2021 SAYE option lapsed on her leaving date as per  
the plan rules.

These all-employee share plans are a core component of our people 
proposition and benefits offering, acting as a modest retention tool  
with over 33% of eligible employees globally being enrolled in plans 
during 2023. 

Implementation of the Remuneration Policy during 2024 (1 January 
2024 to 31 December 2024) (subject to shareholder approval)
Base salary operation:
As part of the Policy review, the Committee also considered base  
salary levels for our Executive Directors, in the context of the overall 
Policy changes.

As discussed in the Statement by the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee (set out on pages 118 to 123), we are proposing a total 
remuneration package which appropriately reflects the CEO’s proven 
ability, exceptional performance and the true market for his role and 
talent, whilst remaining respectful of UK norms (both in terms of the 
balance of different elements of pay and the link to short and longer-
term performance). The CEO’s salary will be £1,375,000 in FY24, at the 
level required to achieve a competitive overall market positioning 
broadly in line with the median of sector peers, without the need to 
increase the other elements of pay to levels that would be inconsistent 
with UK practice.

No changes are proposed to the salary of the exiting CFO.  
A salary of £850,000 was agreed for the new CFO with a start  
date of 26 February 2024.

Pension operation:
The CEO and the CFO receive a pension contribution of 10% of salary 
which is in line with the wider workforce, ensuring compliance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code. 

Annual bonus operation:
 — For FY2024 the weighting of financial measures within the bonus 

pool will be increased from 60% to 75%, incorporating both AOP and 
Future Growth measures. The Group bonus pool will be determined 
based on performance measures weighted 60% Group AOP, 15% 
Future Growth and 25% Group Strategic Objectives to be assessed 
over a 12-month performance period.

 — For FY2024, we are maintaining our high level of focus on 

sustainability within the assessment of the strategic objectives 
element, reflecting our commitment to drive financial stability, 
empower economies and enable customers to create  
sustainable growth.

 — The Executive Directors’ awards are funded from the Group bonus 

pool. Bonus awards for the Executive Directors will be determined in 
accordance with performance assessed: 60% against Group AOP; 
15% Future Growth, 15% against Group Strategic Objectives;  
and 10% against personal objectives (including divisional objectives 
where applicable).

 — Personal performance is assessed against contribution to the 
strategic objectives, including cultural objectives, and against 
role-related goals and expected behaviours, taking into account  
both what has been achieved and how the individuals achieved  
their targets.

 — The Remuneration Committee receives input from the Risk  

Committee with regard to performance related to risk culture 
(awareness, transparency and accountability) when assessing 
remuneration decisions.

 — 60% of any bonus payment for Executive Directors will be paid  
in March 2025. Under our new Policy, the remaining 40% will be 
deferred into shares for a period of three years. 

 — Deferred awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions  

(e.g. in cases of material misstatement, gross misconduct, 
misbehaviour or material failure of risk management) with  
judgement applied by the Committee. 

 — For good leavers, deferred awards will usually vest at the normal 

vesting date and in full, unless the Committee determines to scale 
back the award based on any factors deemed relevant. Where an 
individual is not considered to be a good leaver, unvested awards  
will lapse. 

Long-term incentives (granted under the Equity Incentive Plan):
Long-term incentive awards are intended to be granted under the new 
EIP in 2024 in line with our revised Policy and subject to shareholder 
approval. The 2024 long-term incentive awards will be subject to  
a two-year holding period in addition to the three-year vesting period, 
resulting in a total five-year period from the date of grant.

The Committee has given careful consideration to the target ranges 
applicable to the 2024 grant, in particular to ensure that AEPS growth 
targets are appropriately stretching taking into account both internal  
and external forecasts. For the AEPS element (60% weighting), the 
performance targets will range from 7% to 12.5% growth per annum.  
This means that both the threshold and maximum end of the ranges  
are higher than the targets set for the 2023 LTIP grant. To achieve 
maximum vesting, an incremental £1.1bn AOP would be required in 2026, 
equivalent to incremental income in the region of £2.05bn, relative  
to 2023. We expect that this AEPS range will be one of the highest, if 
not the highest, in the FTSE 30 and continues to demonstrate LSEG’s 
commitment to setting class-leading, stretching targets. Furthermore,  
the higher AEPS baseline makes AEPS CAGR growth increasingly 
challenging to achieve for LSEG.

For the TSR element (40% weighting), the relative performance targets 
will be assessed against our global sector peer group and the FTSE 100, 
each weighted 50:50. Performance targets will range from median to 
upper quartile for both peer groups. 

Malus and clawback provisions will apply to these awards, allowing  
the Committee to reduce subsisting awards or request the re-transfer  
of value in respect of already paid or vested awards in certain 
circumstances (see page 132 above). The 2024 awards will vest three

Awards to be made during 2024
Based on the context and an assessment of personal performance,  
the Remuneration Committee intends to make grants to the Executive 
Directors as set out below.

Shareholding requirements
The minimum shareholding requirement is 600 per cent of base salary 
for the CEO, 400 per cent of base salary for the CFO and 200-300 per 
cent of base salary for the Group Executive team. Executive Directors 
will also be required to hold the lower of their actual shareholding and 
100% of their MSR for two years post-departure.

Non-Executive Directors’ fees for 2024
There are no changes to Non-Executive Directors’ fees and therefore 
the fee schedule for 2024 is as follows: 

Fees

Group Chair

Senior Independent Director

Non-Executive Director base fee  
(inclusive of Committee memberships)

With effect 
from 1 Jan 
2023

£95,000

Audit/Remuneration/Risk Committee Chair 

£40,000 

£40,000

Non-Executive Directors are also required to build up a shareholding 
requirement of 1x basic annual fees, to be built up within three years  
of appointment.

Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration 
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is determined by the Board  
and is neither performance-related nor pensionable. The Chair’s  
fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee. The fees for 
Non-Executive Directors are set at a level which is intended to 
recognise the significant responsibilities of Directors and to attract 
individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make an 
important contribution to the Company’s affairs. Comparisons are  
made with fees paid at FTSE 30 companies.

A travel allowance of £4,000 per intercontinental trip for Non-Executive 
Directors reflects the global nature of the Group’s business and the 
additional time commitment required for travel. The Group Chair is not 
eligible for this allowance as he receives an all-inclusive fee for his role.

Travel and other appropriate expenses with associated taxes  
(including fees incurred in obtaining professional advice) incurred  
in the course of performing their duties are reimbursed to the Chair  
and to the Non-Executive Directors. 

The Chair and the Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of 
the Company’s annual bonus or long-term incentive plans and are not 
entitled to any payments on termination.

Annual Report on Remuneration continued

Outside appointments 
Executive Directors are allowed to accept appointments as Non-
Executive Directors of other companies with the prior approval of the 
Chair or Nomination Committee as appropriate. Approval will only be 
given where the appointment does not represent a conflict of interest 
with the Company’s activities, the Director has sufficient time to 
undertake the additional role and where the wider exposure gained will 
be beneficial to the development of the individual. Executive Directors 
may retain fees to encourage them to seek out the development 
opportunities and valuable experience afforded by these appointments 
and in recognition of the personal responsibility Executives assume in 
such roles.

Anna Manz was a Non-Executive Director of ITV plc and a member of 
their Remuneration and Audit and Risk Committees until 31 August 2023. 
For FY2023 Anna received fees of £52,265 (plus £509 of expenses 
allowances (taxable benefits)) in connection with this appointment.  
She was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of AstraZeneca from  
1 September 2023. For FY2023 she received fees of £40,000 in 
connection with this appointment.

Appointment terms for Michel-Alain Proch
Michel-Alain Proch joined LSEG on 26 February 2024 and was 
appointed to the Board as CFO on 1 March 2024. Prior to joining LSEG, 
Michel-Alain was the Group Chief Financial Officer for Publicis Groupe 
SA and a member of their Management Board. 

Michel-Alain will receive a salary of £850,000 and a pension cash 
allowance of 10% of salary, along with other benefits offered to the wider 
workforce in the UK. He will also be eligible to participate in the Annual 
Bonus and Equity Incentive Plan under the Policy in place for 2024.  
If the proposed Policy is approved, this includes an annual bonus 
opportunity with a maximum of 200% salary and a maximum long-term 
incentive grant of 400% of salary. Michel-Alain forfeited various incentive 
awards which were inflight at the time of his leaving Publicis Groupe SA; 
LSEG has agreed to compensate for the forfeited amounts partly 
through an enhancement to Michel-Alain’s FY24 bonus opportunity. The 
combined regular FY24 bonus (based on a pro-rated opportunity for the 
time served over FY24) plus the compensatory amount will mean that 
his overall FY24 bonus opportunity will be equal to 200% of his salary. 

Michel-Alain will also be granted awards to compensate for 
remuneration forfeited at Publicis Groupe SA as follows:
 — Publicis Groupe’s FY2023 Annual Bonus: LSEG will pay a cash 
amount equivalent to the evidenced forfeited amount, up to  
a maximum of £657,000. This will be paid at the earliest practical  
pay date.

 — Publicis Groupe 2021 LTIP (vesting date of March 2024): Given the 
proximity of the vesting date with Michel-Alain’s start date at LSEG, 
the Group will replace this with a cash buy-out award reflecting the 
actual outcome of the Publicis Groupe 2021 LTIP award. The cash 
amount is subject to evidence of forfeiture and will be payable in  
the first applicable payroll following publication of the award outcome 
for the forfeited award (expected to be late April 2024). 

 — Publicis Groupe 2022 LTIP (vesting date of March 2025): Subject to 

evidence of forfeiture, LSEG will grant a replacement PSU award with 
a grant value equal to the face value of the forfeited award. The PSU 
award will vest as soon as practicable following Publicis Groupe’s 
formal confirmation of, and the number of shares that vest will reflect, 
the performance outcome of the forfeited award.

 — Publicis Groupe 2023 LTIP (vesting date of March 2026): Subject to 

evidence of forfeiture, LSEG will grant a replacement time-based RSU 
award vesting on the original timeline, with a grant value of 60% of 
the face value of the forfeited award; vesting will not be subject to 
performance conditions.

27,612

27,612

23,325

Given Michel-Alain will be relocating from Paris to London to take on  
the CFO role, LSEG will provide immigration, relocation and tax/filing 
support in accordance with LSEG’s usual practices and approved Policy.

Notes:
–   Under the Policy in effect at time of resignation, minimum shareholding requirements were 
300% of salary to be held for two years post-employment. No awards vested prior to her 
termination date and Anna does not own any shares outright. However, the Johnson Matthey 
2020 bonus forfeiture award (LSEG RSU Buy-out) will vest in full on 10 August 2024 and must 
be held for two years post Anna’s termination date.
–  All forfeited awards lapsed on Anna’s resignation date. 

Anna continued to receive her contractual salary, pension allowance and benefits until her 
termination date and was and is not eligible to receive any of the following:
–  2024 salary increase
–  2023 Performance Year Annual Bonus 
–  2024 Performance Year Annual Bonus
–  2024 long-term incentive award grant

Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance
The following graph shows, for the financial period ended 31 December 
2023 and for each of the previous 10 financial periods, the TSR on a 
holding of the Company’s ordinary shares of the same kind and number 
as those by reference to which the FTSE 100 is calculated. The TSR 
graph represents the value, at 31 December 2023, of £100 invested in 
LSEG plc on 31 March 2014, compared with the value of £100 invested  
in the FTSE 100 Index over the same period. The FTSE 100 Index has 
been chosen for the purposes of this graph as it is widely used and 
understood, and LSEG plc is a constituent of the index.

Annual Report on Remuneration continued

CEO to employee pay ratio
Paying our people fairly relative to their role, skills, experience and 
performance is central to our approach to remuneration, and our reward 
framework and policies support us in doing this. The Committee 
consider pay ratios as a useful reference point to inform pay decisions, 
but also take into account a number of other internal and external 
factors when determining executive pay outcomes, including:
 — our reward framework which establishes the compensation structure, 
elements and leverage for each career stage in the organisation, 
providing the Committee with oversight of workforce remuneration;

 — the Group’s financial and strategic performance, including 

consideration of risk;

 — each individual’s performance, including conduct and behaviour, 

against personal objectives; 
 — external market surveys; and
 — wider context and the views of shareholders and investor bodies.

The table below shows the ratios of the CEO single total figure of 
remuneration (as disclosed on page 137) to the total pay and benefits  
of UK people at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile.

The Committee has reviewed the ratios and pay data for the individuals 
identified at each of the relevant quartiles and believe they are a fair 
reflection of the Group’s wider pay policies. The remuneration received 
by each of the individuals is in line with our reward framework. Executive 
Directors’ and other senior managers’ remuneration include a greater 
proportion of performance-related pay when compared to the identified 
people. The Committee considers this is essential to differentiate levels 
of responsibility and align pay to sustainable long-term performance and 
shareholders’ interests.

As a significant proportion of the CEO’s remuneration is linked to 
performance and share price over the longer term, it is expected  
that annual changes in the pay ratio will be significantly influenced  
by LTIP outcomes each year and will fluctuate accordingly. 

Notes to the calculation:
 — We have chosen to use Option C in the regulations to determine the 
pay ratios. The best equivalents for the UK individuals at the 25th, 
50th and 75th percentiles were determined using the hourly rate from 
our additional gender pay disclosure. This option leverages the 
comprehensive analysis we have completed as part of our UK gender 
pay gap reporting exercise. It comprises 95% of the UK population 
(from the entities with 250 or more employees) and all compensation 
awards in the financial year to ensure that the best equivalents 
determined are a fair and true representation of workforce pay at the 
relevant percentiles. Further information on our additional gender pay 
disclosure is provided in our Gender Pay Report which is available at: 
www.lseg.com.

 — The 2023 total pay and benefits of the identified people was 

determined based on data as at 31 December 2023. 

 — The 2023 total pay and benefits for the 25th, 50th and 75th 
percentile people are as follows: £84,375, £111,358, £152,769. 

 — The 2023 base salary for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile people 

are as follows: £65,410, £90,000, £109,819.

Percentage change in remuneration of all Directors and our people
The table below shows the percentage year-on-year change in salary, benefits and annual bonus for each Executive Director and Non-Executive 
Director compared to the global average remuneration of our employees. Where appropriate, amounts have been annualised to provide a 
like-for-like comparison. The 2020/2021 year-on-year reduction in benefits costs for our Non-Executive Directors was largely due to the decrease in 
travel-related expenses during the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2021 year-on-year reduction in the benefits and bonus for our employees was reflective 
of the newly combined company following the Refinitiv transaction and a change in the geographic mix of our employee population. The 2022 
year-on-year increase in benefits costs for our Non-Executive Directors was due to the level of global travel returning to pre-pandemic levels, 
meaning those based in the US travelled to the UK several times during the year, incurring both intercontinental travel fees and travel expenses;  
a Board meeting was also held in New York in June. The 2023 year-on-year increase in benefits cost for the CEO was largely due to tax filing and 
immigration expenses incurred during the year.

Strategic Report 
LSEG presents a fair review of the Group during the financial year  
in the Strategic Report set out on pages 02 to 89, as required by the 
Companies Act 2006. The Strategic Report, which includes a review  
of the Group’s business areas, a financial review and the principal risks 
and uncertainties of the Company, was approved by the Board  
on 28 February 2024 and is incorporated into this Directors’ Report  
by reference.

Results 
The Group made a profit before taxation from continuing operations, 
before non-underlying items for the year, of £2,692 million (2022: 
£2,568 million). After taking into account amortisation of purchased 
intangible assets and non-underlying items, the profit of the Group 
before taxation for the year from continuing operations was £1,195 million 
(2022: £1,241 million). Profit after taxation from continuing operations for 
the year was £948 million (2022: £979 million). 

Dividends 
The Directors are recommending a final dividend for the year of 79.3 
pence (2022: 75.3 pence) per share which is expected to be paid on  
22 May 2024 to shareholders on the register on 19 April 2024. Together 
with the interim dividend of 35.7 pence (2022: 31.7 pence) per share 
paid on 20 September 2023, this produces a total dividend for the 
period of 115.0 pence (2022: 107.0 pence) per share estimated to 
amount to £611 million (2022: £594 million). For 2023, the interim 
dividend was calculated as one-third of the prior full-year dividend. 
Please note that as announced as part of LSEG’s Capital Markets Day  
on 16 and 17 November 2023, LSEG introduced a simplified dividend 
policy which takes effect from 2024. More information on this can be 
found on page 76 and via the Investor Relations segment of our 
corporate website: https://www.lseg.com/en/investor-relations. 

A standard dividend waiver agreement is in place for the employee 
benefit trust (EBT). Further information on the EBT can be found in  
the share capital notes on page 230.

Directors’ Report continued

Share capital 
As at 31 December 2023, the Company had 548,841,716 ordinary shares 
made up of: (i) 520,585,072 voting ordinary shares of 679/86 pence  
each (excluding treasury shares) (94.85%), which carry one vote each;  
(ii) 20,623,911 limited-voting ordinary shares of 679/86 pence each (3.76%), 
which carry one-tenth of a vote each; and (iii) 7,632,733 ordinary shares 
held in treasury (1.39%). The total number of voting rights in LSEG on  
31 December 2023 was 522,647,463. More information on the 
Company’s share capital can be found in note 18 on page 230. 

During the year to 31 December 2023, the Company returned capital  
to shareholders via its on-market share buyback programme and a 
directed buyback. As a result of the 2023 share buyback purchases, 
earnings per share increased by 1.8 pence.

The £750 million on-market share buyback programme launched  
in 2022 and was completed in 2023. This saw LSEG purchase  
£750 million of its voting ordinary shares at an average price of £78.64.  
These purchases were phased over three tranches over a period of  
12 months, with the first tranche having commenced on 5 August 2022 
and the third and final tranche concluding on 10 July 2023. Please see 
the below section on Authority to Purchase Shares for a summary of  
the Company’s share buyback programme. 

The September 2023 directed buyback programme was completed 
after LSEG agreed to a limited variation of the lock-up arrangements 
contained in the Relationship Agreement. This enabled LSEG to  
make an off-market purchase of £750 million worth of limited-voting 
ordinary shares from the Consortium as part of a share placing by the 
Consortium. Please see page 76 for a more in-depth explanation of the 
scheme and the below section on Authority to Purchase Shares for  
a summary of the programme. 

On 12 October 2023, 21 million limited-voting ordinary shares of 679/86 
pence each held by the Consortium were converted into voting ordinary 
shares of 679/86 pence each on a one-for-one basis. These converted 
ordinary shares were admitted to trading on 12 October 2023. 

The Company issued 98,158 new ordinary shares during the year. 

As at 28 February 2024, the total number of voting rights in the 
Company was 522,647,463. The figure 522,647,463 may be used by 
shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will 
determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to 
their interest in, the Company under the FCA’s Disclosure Guidance  
and Transparency Rules.

Share rights 
The rights and obligations attached to the Company’s ordinary shares 
are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which  
can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or by writing to the 
Group Company Secretary. The rights and obligations attached to the 
limited-voting ordinary shares issued in connection with the acquisition 
of Refinitiv on 29 January 2021 are available on the LSEG website and  
in the Articles of Association.

regulated by the Company’s Articles of Association and applicable 
legislation and regulation.

Directors’ Report continued

The Company utilised the authority it obtained at its 2022 AGM to 
complete its on-market share buyback programme during 2023.  
The programme was announced on 5 August 2022 and the Company 
purchased £750 million worth of voting ordinary shares. The buyback 
was phased over a period of 12 months in three tranches with the first 
tranche commencing on 5 August 2022 and completing on 5 October 
2022, the second tranche commencing on 1 December 2022 and 
completing on 14 March 2023 and the third tranche commencing on  
27 March 2023 and completing on 10 July 2023. The arrangements 
entered into with the Consortium Shareholders to enable them to 
participate in the buyback, as described in further detail in the 
announcements made on 5 August 2022, 7 October 2022 and  
20 March 2023 constituted small related party transactions under  
the Listing Rules. 

Shareholders will be asked to give a similar authority to purchase shares 
at the forthcoming AGM. 

Upon completion of the above on-market share buyback programme on 
10 July 2023, 9,536,985 voting ordinary shares (nominal value of 679/86 
pence) had been purchased by the Company at an average purchase 
price of £78.64 per voting ordinary share for the total consideration of 
£750 million. As at 31 December 2023, 7,632,733 of these ordinary 
shares were held in treasury, representing 1.39% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital (comprising ordinary shares and limited-
voting ordinary shares). 1,904,252 ordinary shares purchased as part  
of the programme were initially held as treasury shares but were 
subsequently transferred to the Employee Benefit Trust on 2 March 
2023 to satisfy awards under the LSEG share plans due to vest  
between 1 March 2023 and 31 March 2024. 

In addition, the Company participated in a directed buyback programme 
during 2023 following the passing of a special resolution at the previous 
AGM to give the Company authority to make off-market purchases of 
shares from the Consortium.

To facilitate the programme, on 6 September 2023, LSEG agreed  
to a limited variation of the lock-up arrangements contained in the 
Relationship Agreement which was entered into on completion of the 
Refinitiv acquisition. The Consortium was therefore permitted to dispose 
of up to a further 38 million shares on a one-off basis by means of  
a placing, sale of call options and directed buyback. On 11 September 
2023, LSEG completed an off-market purchase of 9,500,466 limited-
voting ordinary shares at a purchase price of £78.94 per limited-voting 
ordinary share from the Consortium. The total consideration of the 
off-market purchase was £750 million, in line with the Company’s 
expectations in its notice of AGM on 24 March 2023. For more 
information on the directed buyback, please see page 76 which  
falls within the Section 172(1) Statement. 

The authority given by shareholders at the 2023 AGM for LSEG to make 
off-market purchases of its own shares pursuant to the directed buyback 
contract entered into between LSEG and the Consortium shareholders 
on 11 May 2023 will expire at the 2024 AGM. As such, shareholders will 
be asked to replace the authority at the forthcoming AGM. For further 
details on the terms of the directed buyback contract, please see 
LSEG’s notice of annual general meeting circulated on 24 March 2023 
and available on LSEG’s website.

Authority to allot shares 
The authority conferred on the Directors at last year’s AGM to allot 
shares in the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£12,768,220 (representing 33.3% of the issued share capital of the 
Company (excluding treasury shares) as at the latest practicable date 
before publication of the Notice of the Company’s last AGM) or, in 
connection with a pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders by way  
of a rights issue, up to a maximum nominal amount of £25,536,440 

(representing 66.6% of the issued share capital of the Company 
(excluding treasury shares) as at the latest practicable date before 
publication of the Notice of the Company’s last AGM), expires on the 
date of the forthcoming AGM. Shareholders will be asked to give a 
similar authority to allot shares at the forthcoming AGM. 

Directors’ interests 
Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company as at 31 December 
2023, according to the register maintained under the Companies Act 
2006, are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 151. No 
company in the Group was, during or at the end of the year, party to any 
contract of significance in which any Director was materially interested. 

Directors’ Indemnity 
Details of qualifying third-party indemnity provisions (as defined by 
Section 3 of the Companies Act 2006) in force during the course of  
the year ended 31 December 2023 can be found on page 103. Such 
qualifying third-party indemnity provisions remain in force as at the  
date of approving this Directors’ Report. 

Employees
Information on the Group’s employees including the Group’s approach 
to human rights and diversity, the outcomes relating to the Group’s 
employee engagement survey and further examples of employee 
engagement can be found in the Sustainability section starting on  
page 58. Information on the Group’s share schemes is provided in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 124. 

The Group welcomes and gives full and fair consideration to 
applications from diverse candidates, including persons with visible  
and non-visible disabilities. As with all areas of inclusion, our focus is  
on providing the right tools to support people to be successful in the 
workplace. The Group assists employees who have a disability with 
training, career development and progression opportunities and,  
in a situation where an existing employee develops a disability, our 
approach is to provide continuing support and training wherever 
possible. Where changes to working practices or structure affect 
employees, they are consulted and given the appropriate assistance.

LSEG is a Valuable 500 Iconic Leader and as such has made a pledge 
to ensure we: 
 — drive towards removing bias related to disability hiring and provide 

the necessary tools for people with a disability to succeed; 

 — have inclusive hiring and onboarding practices;
 — make subtitles available for all videos we publish;
 — create inclusive offices and infrastructure across all our locations, 

relying on consistent guidelines; 

 — have a Company-wide leadership pledge and commit to support 

disability; and 

 — improve physical accessibility for existing locations. 

We’re committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for 
everyone. The LSEG Accessibility Network works in partnership with  
the Group to make sure commitments are implemented. We recognise 
key observances such as International Day of Persons with Disabilities 
and World Mental Health Day to raise awareness, reduce stigma and 
celebrate the contribution of people with disabilities. 

All employees are provided with information on matters of concern  
to them in their work through regular briefing meetings and internal 
publications. To inform employees of the economic and financial factors 
affecting our business, regular updates are posted on our intranet  
and engagement events are hosted, such as townhall style meetings 
with members of our Executive Committee, providing a briefing  
on specific areas of the business. Alongside this, information is 
cascaded to employees through people leaders, also boosting 
employee engagement.

Sustainability
As a Group, we recognise that we must use resources in ways that 
deliver long-term sustainability and profitability for the business and 
have regard for its impact on the environment. We also take such factors 
into account in developing our products and services.

Significant agreements 
The following are significant agreements as at 31 December 2023 to 
which the Company is a party that take effect, alter or terminate  
upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid: 

Further details of our approach to climate, our targets and progress  
on environmental matters, as well as methodology and verification  
can be found in the Sustainability section on pages 58 to 68.

Research and development 
LSEG undertakes research and development activities that align with 
new revenue opportunities in financial services. The research combines 
significant domain expertise with modern quantitative, data science and 
cloud engineering practices. The large variety of analytics and data 
available at LSEG enables research and development to apply current 
techniques and technologies. Technical expertise features prominently 
in LSEG research functions, including AI and large language models, 
quantitative and data driven modelling, machine learning and natural 
language processing. Research also includes significant expertise in 
customer experience design and user experience.

Political donations 
During the year the Group did not make any direct political donations  
to EU or non-EU organisations or incur any political expenditure.

It remains the Company’s policy not to make direct political donations  
or to incur direct political expenditure; however, the application of the 
relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 is potentially very broad 
in nature and, like last year, the Board is seeking shareholder authority 
to ensure that the Group does not inadvertently breach these provisions 
as a result of the breadth of its business activities, although the Board 
has no intention of using this authority. As with previous years the Board 
is proposing that shareholders pass a resolution at the forthcoming AGM 
to authorise the Group to: 
 — make political donations to political parties and independent election 

candidates not exceeding £100,000 in total; 

 — make political donations to political organisations other than political 

parties not exceeding £100,000 in total; and

 — incur political expenditure not exceeding £100,000 in total,  

provided that in any event the aggregate amount of any such 
donations and expenditure made or incurred by the Group shall  
not exceed £100,000.

Notwithstanding the Company’s policy not to make political donations, 
we recognise the rights of our employees to participate in the political 
process. Their rights to do so are governed by the applicable laws in the 
countries in which we operate. For example, in the US under the Federal 
Election Campaign Act, eligible employees can establish nonpartisan 
political action committees known as a ‘“PAC” that support voluntary 
employee participation in the political process. Corporate PACs are a 
common feature of the US political system and operate independently 
of any political party or candidate.

LSEG US Holdco, Inc. operates a PAC for eligible employees. Consistent 
with US law, LSEG US Holdco, Inc. pays for the PAC’s administrative 
expenses; providing such support is not considered to be a political 
donation or expenditure under US law. In accordance with the 
applicable law, contributions from the PAC are funded entirely by 
voluntary contributions from eligible employees. All decisions on the 
amounts and recipients of contributions are directed by a steering 
committee comprising employees eligible to contribute to the PAC.  
All PAC receipts and disbursements are publicly disclosed on the  
FEC’s website: https://www.fec.gov/data/committee. 

Strategic Initiatives Agreement with Microsoft
As part of the strategic partnership with Microsoft Corporation,  
certain subsidiaries of the Company are party to a strategic initiatives 
agreement with Microsoft Ltd (the “Strategic Initiatives Agreement”). 
Under the Strategic Initiatives Agreement, the parties have agreed to 
jointly pursue strategic initiatives in relation to LSEG’s data architecture, 
Workspace solution and analytics capabilities, as well as explore the 
development of digital market infrastructure based on cloud technology. 
The Strategic Initiatives Agreement includes a provision permitting 
Microsoft to terminate the agreement in circumstances where the 
Company comes under the control of an entity that Microsoft are 
prohibited from dealing with by a sanctioning body, or that is based  
in a jurisdiction subject to international sanctions. 

Relationship Agreement
The Company is party to a Relationship Agreement with York Parent 
Limited (which is owned by Thomson Reuters Corporation and a 
consortium of certain investment funds managed by Blackstone Group 
Inc.), York Holdings II Limited, York Holdings III Limited (each of which  
are wholly-owned subsidiaries of York Parent Limited) and BCP York 
Holdings (Delaware) L.P. (which is a holding vehicle for the consortium of 
investment funds managed by Blackstone Group Inc.). The Relationship 
Agreement governs the relationship between the parties following 
completion of the Refinitiv acquisition, including the shareholders’  
rights to nominate Directors for appointment to the LSEG Board.  
The Relationship Agreement would terminate in the event of a change 
of control of LSEG that resulted in these shareholders ceasing to hold,  
in aggregate, 10% or more of LSEG shares. Further information on  
the Relationship Agreement can be found on pages 65-70 of the 
shareholder prospectus dated 9 December 2020 which is available  
on the LSEG website: www.lseg.com/investor-relations.

Thomson Reuters News Agreement
Certain subsidiaries within the Group are party to an agreement with 
Reuters News dated 1 October 2018, under which Reuters News 
provides, for a 30-year term, various categories of general news and 
financial content, alongside certain accompanying intellectual property 
licence agreements in relation to the provision of such content (the 
“Thomson Reuters News Agreement”). The Thomson Reuters News 
Agreement includes a provision requiring Refinitiv to obtain consent  
to assign the agreement pursuant to a change in control in certain 
circumstances, a breach of which could potentially lead to a termination 
of the agreement.

Facility Agreements 
 — Amended 2017 Revolving Credit Facility  

On 22 November 2023, the amended and restated £1.425 billion 
syndicated, committed, revolving credit facility agreement was further 
amended and extended (the “Amended 2017 RCF”). The facility limit 
was increased to £1.925 billion and the maturity date was extended  
to 16 December 2027. The facility provides flexible financing capacity 
for the general corporate purposes of the Group and includes  
£1.925 billion euro and US dollar swingline facilities as backstop 
support for commercial paper issuance.

 — 2020 Credit Facility  

The Company has a syndicated, committed $2 billion and  
£1.075 billion revolving credit facility agreement dated 16 December 
2020 (the “2020 Facility”), which came into effect upon the 
completion of the Refinitiv acquisition. Both the euro and US dollar 
term loans have been repaid. The revolving facility offers the  
Group additional flexible financing and is available for the general 
corporate purposes of the Group. The revolving facility contained  
two one-year extension options, both of which have been exercised. 
Consequently, the final maturity date of the revolving credit facility is 
now 16 December 2027. 

 — Terms of Amended 2017 RCF and 2020 Facility  

The terms of the Amended 2017 RCF and the 2020 Facility are 
appropriate for an investment grade borrower and each includes 
change of control provisions which, if triggered, allow the relevant 
facility agent, upon instructions from the majority lenders, to cancel 
the facility and declare all outstanding loans under the relevant 
agreement, together with accrued interest and all other amounts 
accrued, due and payable. As a result of the market shift away from 
LIBOR rates, these facilities have transitioned from sterling and US 
dollar LIBOR reference rates to SONIA and SOFR rates respectively 
(including an appropriate credit adjustment spread) where applicable.

Notes 
 — Euro Medium-Term Notes  

The Company, together with its subsidiary LSEG Netherlands B.V., has 
issued to the wholesale fixed income market under its Euro Medium 
Term Note Programme (the value of which is £4 billion), three €500 
million tranches of euro notes due in 2024, 2027 and 2029 and two 
€700 million tranches of euro notes due in 2026 and 2030. The 
notes contain a “redemption upon change of control” provision which, 
if triggered by the combination of a change of control and, within  
120 days thereafter, a credit rating downgrade to non-investment grade, 
allows noteholders to exercise their option to require the Company to 
redeem the notes and pay any accrued and unpaid interest due. 

 — Global Medium-Term Notes  

The Company, together with its subsidiaries LSEG Netherlands B.V. 
and LSEGA Financing plc, has issued to the wholesale fixed income 
market under its Global Medium Term Notes Programme (the value of 
which is £10 billion) £500 million of sterling notes due in 2030, three 
€500 million tranches of euro notes due in 2025, 2028 and 2033, 
$500 million of US dollar notes due in 2024, two $1 billion tranches  
of US dollar notes due in 2026 and 2028, $1.25 billion of US dollar 
notes due in 2031 and $750 million of US dollar notes due in 2041. 
The notes contain a “redemption upon change of control” provision 
which, if triggered by the combination of a change of control  
and, within 120 days thereafter, a credit rating downgrade to 
non-investment grade, allows noteholders to exercise their option  
to require the Company and/or its subsidiaries to redeem the notes 
and pay any accrued and unpaid interest due. 

Commercial Paper
 — The Company issues commercial paper to the debt capital markets 

from time to time under its £1.5 billion Euro Commercial Paper  
(ECP) Programme and $2.5 billion US Commercial Paper (USCP) 
Programme. The programmes provide flexible financing capacity for 
the general corporate purposes of the Group and are backstopped 
by the £1.925 billion euro and US dollar swingline facilities available 
under the Amended 2017 RCF. At 31 December 2023, there were 
balances outstanding of $937 million under the USCP programme, 
and €353 million and £165 million under the ECP programme.

Employee Share Plans 
The rules of the Company’s employee share plans set out the 
consequences of a change of control of the Company on employees’ 
rights under the plans. Generally, such rights will vest on a change of 
control and participants will become entitled to acquire shares in the 

Company (although in certain circumstances the Remuneration 
Committee has the discretion to defer vesting and to require rights  
to be exchanged for equivalent rights over the acquiring company’s 
shares). More information on Employee Share Plans can be found in  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 124. 

Events since the financial year-end 
For further information on events since the reporting date, please see 
note 25 on page 239. 

Employee Benefit Trust 
As at 31 December 2023, the trustee of the London Stock Exchange 
Employee Benefit Trust, which is an independent trustee, held 1,178,957 
shares under the terms of the trust for the benefit of employees and 
former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The trust is  
a discretionary trust and the shares are held to meet employees’ 
entitlements under the Company’s share plans. Employees have no 
voting rights in relation to the unencumbered shares while they are  
held in trust. The trustee has full discretion to exercise the voting rights 
attached to the unencumbered shares or to abstain from voting. Shares 
acquired by employees through the Company’s employee share plans 
rank equally with the ordinary shares in issue and have no special rights.

Branches outside the UK 
Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have established branches  
in a number of different countries in which they operate. 

Financial risk management 
The use of financial instruments by the Group and the Group’s financial 
risk management have been specifically considered by the Directors 
and relevant disclosures appear in principal risks and uncertainties,  
on pages 79 to 88 of this Annual Report and in the notes to the financial 
statements, on pages 176 to 254 of this Annual Report.

Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors 
In accordance with Section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Directors confirm, in the case of each Director in office at the date  
the Directors’ Report is approved as listed on pages 94 to 97, that: 
 — so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 

of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 

 — they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as  

a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information. 

Future developments 
The Group’s likely future developments can be found in the Market 
Trends and Our Response section of the Annual Report (pages 08  
to 09). This section covers financial, technological and societal trends 
that are affecting the Group and demonstrates how we are evolving  
as an organisation to adapt appropriately going forward.

Auditors 
As disclosed in last year’s Annual Report following an audit tender 
process in 2022, Deloitte LLP will be appointed as the Group’s external 
auditor for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 subject to 
shareholder approval at the AGM.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and regulations.

on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements  
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards (IFRSs), and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law), including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework (FRS 101).

Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view  
of the state of the affairs of the Group and the Company and of the  
profit or loss for that year. 

In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 — select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 

Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors  
and then apply them consistently; 

 — present information, including accounting policies, in a manner  
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 

 — make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable  

and prudent; 

 — provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs and in respect of the parent company  
financial statements, FRS 101, is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the Group and the Company’s financial position and 
financial performance; 

 — in respect of the Group financial statements, state whether  

UK-adopted international accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in  
the financial statements; 

 — in respect of the parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101, have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and 

 — prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless  
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will 
continue in business 

The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements. 

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them  
to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006, other applicable laws  
and regulations, including the requirements of the Listing Rules and the 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules. As regards the Group 
financial statements, the Directors are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 

Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible 
for preparing a strategic report, directors’ report, directors’ remuneration 
report and corporate governance statement that comply with that  
law and those regulations. The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information  

The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Overview and Strategic Report sections of the Annual Report on  
pages 02 to 89. 

In particular, the current economic conditions continue to pose a number 
of risks and uncertainties for the Group and these are set out in Principal 
Risks and Uncertainties on pages 79 to 88. 

The Financial Risk Management objectives and policies of the Group 
and the exposure of the Group to capital risk, credit risk, market risk and 
liquidity risk are discussed on pages 215 to 229. The Group continues to 
meet Group and individual entity capital requirements and day-to-day 
liquidity needs through the Group’s cash resources and available  
credit facilities. 

The combined total of committed facilities and bonds issued at  
31 December 2023 was £12,108 million (2022: £10,699 million). 

The Directors have reviewed the Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, which show that the Group has sufficient financial 
resources. On the basis of this review, and after making due enquiries, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the  
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The Group’s 
business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position and its objectives and policies 
in managing the financial risks to which it is exposed, and its capital are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 02 to 89. 

Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are set out on  
pages 94 to 97 of this Annual Report confirms that, to the best of their 
knowledge and belief: 
 — the Group and the Company financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the Group taken as a whole; 

 — the report of the Directors contained in the Annual Report, including 
the Strategic Report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and 

 — they consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and the

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members  
of London Stock Exchange Group plc

Opinion
In our opinion:
 — the financial statements of London Stock Exchange Group plc  

(the ‘parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) give a true 
and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 31st December 2023 and of the group’s profit for the  
year then ended;

 — the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 

accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards; 

 — the parent company financial statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and

 — The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with  
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.We have audited the 
financial statements (see table below) of the parent Company and  
the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Tables within the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report identified  
as ‘audited’ 

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and  
UK adopted international accounting standards. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities  
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.

1  Non-audit services were provided by Deloitte Tax LLP. The component auditor is  

Deloitte & Touche LLP.

Independence
We are independent of the Group and parent Company in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard  
as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 

During the course of our independence procedures for the  
31 December 2022 year-end audit, it was identified that one non-audit 
service prohibited under the FRC’s Ethical Standard was provided by 
Deloitte USA1 during 2023, having been subcontracted from Deloitte 
LLP in the UK. These services are prohibited as Deloitte USA are also 
the auditor of the Tradeweb Markets Inc. component. 

The service provided to the Group related to tax advice to certain 
employees. Total fees for this service were £1,641. This service is  
no longer being provided. As a result of the breach, we performed  
a further review of Deloitte USA’s audit working papers for key 
judgements and estimates. We also discussed with Deloitte USA  
their approach to identifying this breach and assessed the service 
provided to conclude on the extent of the breach. 

We considered that the provision of the service did not create a 
self-review threat as the prohibited service was not provided to the 
entity being audited by Deloitte USA, Tradeweb Markets Inc., and there 
was therefore no risk of Deloitte USA reviewing their own work. 
Appropriate safeguards also existed as the individuals who performed 
the prohibited services were not part of the Deloitte USA audit 
engagement team. We informed the Audit Committee following 
identification in February 2023. We considered this to be a minor  
breach of the FRC’s Ethical Standard; that an objective, reasonable and 
informed third party would not conclude that our independence was 
impaired; and that we remain independent of the Group and the parent 
Company in conducting the audit.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation  
of the Directors’ assessment of the Group and parent Company’s  
ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting  
for a period of twelve months from the date of signing the financial 
statements included:
 — Obtaining an understanding of the Directors’ use of the going 

concern basis of preparation. This included reviewing their going 
concern assessment and associated underlying forecasts and 
assumptions and performing inquiries of management and those 
charged with governance; 

 — Assessing the appropriateness of key assumptions made in the 

Group’s and parent Company’s business plan, by comparing them to 
historical performance and challenging the achievability of budgeted 
growth. In assessing the reasonableness of these key assumptions, 
we considered planned cost and revenue synergies, the trading 
environment, and the current uncertain geopolitical and economic 
outlook including the impact of high inflation and increased interest 
rates, principal risks and appropriate mitigating factors. We performed 
back-testing by comparing the budget of prior periods to actual 
results to assess the historical accuracy of the forecasting process; 

 — Testing the clerical accuracy of the going concern assessment 

including the data used in stress testing; 

 — Evaluating the reasonableness of adverse forecasts by benchmarking 

the stress testing scenario assumptions against external data;

 — Evaluating the plausibility of management actions available to mitigate 

the impact of the reverse stress test by comparing them to our 
understanding of the Group and parent Company including the  
ability to refinance debt;

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of London Stock Exchange Group plc continued

 — Evaluating the level of liquidity of the Group and parent Company to 
support ongoing requirements for a period of 12 months from the  
date of signing the financial statements; and 

 — Assessing the appropriateness of the going concern disclosures by 
evaluating the consistency with the going concern assessment and 
for compliance with the relevant reporting requirements.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any 
material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually  
or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve 
months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. 

In relation to the Group and parent Company’s reporting on how they 
have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement 
in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect 
to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.

Overview of our audit approach

Audit scope

 — We performed an audit of the complete financial 

information of 8 components and audit procedures  
on specific balances for a further 15 components and 
other procedures on the remaining 107 components.
 — The components where we performed full or specific 
audit procedures accounted for 92% of absolute 
pre-tax profit, 95% of Revenue and 99.9% of  
Total assets.

 — A component is defined as an entity for which 

management prepares component financial information 
that is included in the Group financial statements.

Key audit 
matters

 — Revenue recognition. 
 — Measurement of acquired intangible assets,  

including goodwill.

 — Capitalisation and subsequent impairment of  

internally developed software.

 — Accounting for acquisitions.

An overview of the scope of the parent Company and Group audits 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account 
size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of 
group-wide controls, changes in the business environment, the potential 
impact of climate change and other factors such as recent Internal  
audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at  
each component.

In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial 
statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 130 reporting 
components of the Group (2022: 126 reporting components),  
we selected 23 components. 

Full scope components – Of the 23 components selected  
(2022: 19 components), we performed an audit of the complete  
financial information of 8 components (2022: 8 components)  
which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. 

Specific scope components – For the remaining 15 components  
(2022: 11 components), we performed audit procedures on specific 
accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for 
the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements 
either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. 

The primary audit team is defined as the EY London audit team 
responsible for issuing the opinion on the Group and parent Company 
financial statements and coordinating the Group audit. The component 
team is defined as an audit team, who, at the request of the primary 
audit team, performs work on the financial information related to  
a component for the Group audit. 

5 of the full scope components and all of the specific scope 
components are audited by the primary audit team, with the remaining  
3 full components audited by component teams as set out in the  
table below:

one-off impairment of intangible and other assets of 
£32 million; separation and integration costs of  
(£9 million); and retention costs of £8 million.

The table below reflects the proportion of the Group that is included 
within the full scope and specific scope components. The audit scope  
of these components may not have included testing of all significant 
accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage  
of significant accounts tested for the Group.

Of the remaining 107 components that together represent 8% of the 
Group’s absolute pre-tax profit, none are individually greater than 3%  
of the Group’s absolute pre-tax profit. The absolute pre-tax profit has 
been used within our assessment, as a result of there being loss making 
components within the Group. For these components, we performed 
other procedures, including analytical reviews, testing of Group entity 
level controls, testing of consolidation journals and intercompany 
eliminations, to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement 
to the Group financial statements.

Changes from the prior year 
In the current year, there has been an increase in the number of 
reporting components, as well as the number of in-scope components 
for the Group audit. This is as a result of newly acquired entities being 
included and changes in balances reported in components in the 
normal course of business. Audit procedures have been designed  
and updated to reflect this change in scoping approach.

Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by 
component auditors from other EY global network firms and Deloitte 
USA operating under our instruction. For the 3 full scope components, 
where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined 
the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that 
sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion 
on the Group as a whole.

The Group audit team interacted regularly with the component teams 
during various stages of the audit and were responsible for the scope 
and direction of the audit process. Physical site visits were undertaken 
by the Senior Statutory Auditor and other senior members of the primary 
audit team during the current year’s audit cycle to the component teams 
in United States of America and India. These physical site visits and 
regular virtual meetings involved discussing and challenging the audit 
approach with the component team and any findings arising from their 
work, meeting with local management, attending planning and closing 
meetings and reviewing relevant audit working papers on risk areas, 
through direct access or through the use of shared screen functionality. 
This, together with the additional procedures performed by the primary 
team, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group and 
parent Company financial statements and ensured that the Senior 
Statutory Auditor exercised appropriate oversight of the principal 
locations of the Group.

Climate change 
Stakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will 
impact the Group. The Group has determined that climate-related risks 
and opportunities arise from regulatory, technology and market changes 
in the transition to a low carbon economy as well as acute and chronic 
physical risks from climate change. These are explained in the required 
Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and in Principal 
risks and uncertainties. They have also explained their climate 
commitments in the Sustainability section. All of these disclosures  
form part of the “Other information,” rather than the audited financial 
statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore 
consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course  
of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with 
our responsibilities on “Other information”. 

In planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts 
of climate change on the Group’s business and any consequential 
material impact on its financial statements. 

The Group has explained in note 1.7 how they have reflected the impact 
of climate change in their financial statements including how this aligns 
with their commitment to the aspirations of the Paris Agreement to 
achieve net zero emissions by 2040. The areas considered most 
relevant relating to climate change are included in note 1.7. 

Our audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the 
financial statements was focused on evaluating management’s 
assessment of the impact of climate risk, both physical and transition 
and on ensuring that the effects of emerging climate risks disclosed 
have been appropriately reflected by management in reaching their 
judgements in relation to the valuation of assets and liabilities. We also 
challenged the Directors’ considerations of climate change risks in their 
assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures. 

Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change 
on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to impact  
a key audit matter.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of London Stock Exchange Group plc continued

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Risk

Our response to the risk

Revenue recognition 
The Group reported £8,061 million (2022: £7,454 
million) of revenue from external customers, which 
consisted of £5,637 million (2022: £5,259 million) in 
Data & Analytics, £1,546 million (2022: £1,459 million)  
in Capital Markets and £878 million (2022: £736 million) 
in Post Trade. 

The Group generates revenue from a variety of 
sources that are material in size and volume.  
The complexity in auditing revenue relates to the 
judgements applied in:

 — the amount and timing of subscription revenue 
recognition based on non-standard terms in 
customer agreements; and

 — the year end revenue accruals for FTSE Russell 

asset-based revenues.

Refer to the Report of the Audit Committee; Accounting 
policies; Notes 2 and 3 of the Financial Statements. 

The risk has remained consistent with the prior year.

 — Control assessment: We confirmed our understanding of the processes and controls relevant 
to the material revenue streams of the Group. We also evaluated the design effectiveness and 
tested operating effectiveness of key controls including IT systems and related IT controls for 
certain revenue streams. 

 — Overall procedures: We evaluated the appropriateness of the revenue recognition policy  
in accordance with IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. Additionally, we 
benchmarked the accounting policies with industry peers to ensure they are in line with 
industry standards. We performed cut-off testing to verify that revenue was recognised in  
the correct period. We performed analytical procedures and journal entry testing in order  
to identify and test the risk of misstatement arising from management override of controls.  
We performed trend analysis over these revenue streams. This includes analysing the trend 
between subscription revenue and cancellations. 

 — Subscription revenue in Data & Analytics: For a sample of significant contracts, we obtained 
the executed contract and performed a review of the contract terms against the requirements 
of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, tested the invoices raised and cash 
collected as applicable. To test the authenticity of the contracts and mitigate the risk of falsified 
contracts, we used digital tools to detect any discrepancies and anomalies in contracts.
 — FTSE Russell revenue accruals: We selected a sample of revenue accruals and obtained 

appropriate supporting evidence such as vouching the basis for the accrued amounts to third 
party sources or prior period billings. We also agreed to invoices raised post year end and 
cash collected where applicable. We also performed substantive analytical procedures over 
revenue accruals recognised across the period, in comparison to total revenue recognised  
by month and counterparty to identify outliers on which to perform further procedures. For 
revenue based on assets under management (‘AUM’), we independently reperformed the 
revenue calculation and tested a sample using AUM amounts from supporting customer 
agreements, independent third-party sources, where available, or customer declarations.

 — Disclosure We assessed the adequacy of the relevant disclosures made in the  

financial statements.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee

We are satisfied that revenue related to subscription revenue and FTSE Russell revenue accruals within the Data & Analytics business are not materially 
misstated and are recorded in accordance with IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’.

Risk

Our response to the risk

Measurement of acquired intangible assets,  
including goodwill
The Group reporting goodwill of £19,246 million  
(2022: £19,829 million) and net purchased intangible 
assets of £11,158 million (2022: £12,584 million)

Refer to the Report of the Audit Committee; Accounting 
policies and Note 9 of the Financial Statements.

The complexity in auditing goodwill relates to the use 
of judgement in the impairment assessment. Goodwill 
is sensitive to a number of judgements and estimates; 
in particular cash flow forecasts, long-term growth rates 
(LTGR), discount rates, customer retention rates and 
royalty rates.

The complexity in auditing purchased intangible assets 
relates to the use of judgement in assessing if an 
impairment assessment should be performed and 
re-evaluating the amortisation method and useful life 
for each asset. 

The risk has remained consistent with the prior year.

 — Control assessment: We confirmed our understanding of the impairment assessment process 

and assessed the design effectiveness of key controls.

 — Carrying value of goodwill: For all cash generating units (CGUs), we examined the cash flow 

forecasts and tested compliance with the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’.
We tested the clerical accuracy of these forecasts and compared them to the three-year 
business plans approved by the Board. 
We evaluated the reasonableness of the cash flow forecasts using our understanding of  
the CGU and analysing the budgeted growth rates, its historical growth rates and other 
relevant market expectations and developments including changes in inflation and  
increasing interest rates. 
We compared prior periods’ cash flow forecasts to actual results to assess management’s 
forecasting accuracy. 
We tested the discount rates used by each of the CGUs, as well as the LTGRs, with 
involvement of our valuation specialists; we evaluated these model inputs within each 
impairment model, by comparing them to a range of economic and industry forecasts and 
market data where appropriate, as well as to other similar companies.
We also performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions (including the model inputs, 
cash flow forecasts, royalty rates and customer retention rates) to understand the impact that 
reasonably possible changes would have on the overall carrying value of the goodwill and 
purchased intangible assets.

 — Purchased intangible assets: We evaluated management’s assessment of the ability to identify 

a separate recoverable amount by asset in order to perform an impairment assessment.  
We assessed the appropriateness of the amortisation method and useful life used in the 
amortisation calculation by comparing to business plans and indicators of asset value. 
 — Disclosure We assessed the adequacy of the relevant disclosures made in the financial 

statements, including the completeness of the sensitivity disclosure.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee

We are satisfied that the carrying values of goodwill and purchased intangible assets are materially correct and the related disclosures are compliant with 
IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’.

Risk

Our response to the risk

Capitalisation and subsequent impairment of 
internally developed software
The Group reported capitalised internally developed 
software of £2,717 million (2022: £2,653 million) and an 
impairment charge of £10 million (2022: £11 million)

Refer to the Report of the Audit Committee;  
Accounting policies; and Note 9 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements 

Auditing the capitalisation of software costs is complex 
as it involves management judgement in respect of  
the criteria set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. This 
includes determining whether costs can be capitalised, 
identifying when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amounts may not be 
recoverable, and determining recoverable amounts 
involving estimation of discount rates, LTGRs, cash flow 
forecasts and the amortisation periods for internally 
developed software. 

The risk has remained consistent with the prior year.

 — Control assessment: We confirmed our understanding of both the capitalisation and 

impairment assessment processes and assessed the design and operating effectiveness  
of key controls. 

 — Additions testing: For a sample of additions, we have agreed amounts capitalised to 
supporting documentation to verify whether the costs were incurred and meet the 
capitalisation criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. 

 — Impairment assessment: To assess the completeness of indicators of impairment identified  
by management, we selected a sample of assets, including those not yet brought into use or 
projects put on hold, and tested and challenged management’s assessment of indicators of 
impairment. This included analysis against budgeted spend, identifying projects with no recent 
spend and if new projects or business developments may have made previous assets 
obsolete. 
Where an impairment has been recognised, we tested the key assumptions used within the 
assessment, such as the discount rates, LTGR and cash flow forecasts with involvement of  
our valuation specialists as needed. We also assessed the sensitivity analysis performed by 
management and performed independent additional sensitivity analysis on the impairment 
model inputs, to understand the impact that reasonably possible changes to key assumptions 
would have on the overall carrying value of the internally developed software. 

 — Disclosure: We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee

We are satisfied that the carrying values of internally generated software are materially correct and the related disclosures are compliant with IAS 36 
‘Impairment of Assets’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’.

Accounting for acquisitions 
During 2023, the Group completed the acquisition  
of AcadiaSoft, Inc, (Acadia).

Net Assets Acquired: £229 million

Goodwill Recognised: £341 million

There are judgements and estimates in accounting  
for acquisitions including the determination of the  
fair value of net assets acquired and the resulting 
goodwill which are presented and disclosed in the 
financial statements. 

Refer to the Report of the Audit Committee;  
Accounting policies; and Note 21 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements 

The risk has reduced this year given the lower volume 
of businesses acquired and value of the acquisition 
compared to the prior year (Four significant 
acquisitions, with total net assets acquired of  
£288 million, and £569 million of goodwill recognised).

 — Control assessment: We confirmed our understanding of the business combinations 

accounting process including process and controls relevant to the acquisitions.
We held discussions with management to understand the governance structures and oversight 
of the accounting for each of the transactions.

 — Technical accounting: We reviewed management’s business combinations accounting papers 

and management’s assessment of the acquiree’s accounting policies, understanding the 
differences with the Group and resulting impact.

 — Net assets acquired and resulting goodwill: We verified the completeness and accuracy of 

the carrying value of the acquired net assets. This included tests of detail and analytical review 
procedures over significant balance sheet accounts at the acquisition date.
We assessed the reasonableness of the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed and resulting goodwill with our valuation specialists.
We assessed the appropriateness of intangible asset valuation models, tested the 
completeness and accuracy of the key inputs used and the reasonableness of the key 
assumptions including discount rates, royalty rates, attrition rates, contributory asset charge 
rates, long-term growth rates and cash flow forecasts. This included developing independent 
valuation ranges for net assets acquired.
We involved our Tax specialists to evaluate the appropriateness of deferred taxes related to 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and to assess the appropriateness of the tax rate 
used in relation to each acquisition.

 — Disclosure: We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements.

Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee

We concluded that the fair value of net assets acquired, and the resulting goodwill are materially correct and fall within our independently developed range. 

We are satisfied that the Acadia acquisition and the related disclosures are materially correct and are in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of London Stock Exchange Group plc continued

Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the 
audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 

Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually  
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence  
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent  
of our audit procedures. 

We determined materiality for the Group to be £59 million (2022:  
£61 million), which is 5% (2022: 5%) of pre-tax profit from continuing 
operations, calculated by adjusting for certain non-underlying items we 
considered to be non-recurring, relating to: investment remeasurement 
gain of (£69 million); write-off of assets of £34 million; impairment of 
intangible and other assets of £32 million; separation and integration 
costs of (£9 million); and, retention costs of £8 million.

We consider the basis of our materiality to be one of the important 
considerations for shareholders of the Group in assessing the financial 
performance of the Group. It is linked to the key earnings measures 
discussed when the Group presents the financial results. In addition, 
within non-underlying items, the Group also excludes amortisation of 
purchased intangibles to present adjusted operating profit; this amount 
is not excluded from our materiality calculation. 

Starting basis
 — £1,194 million
 — Profit before tax from continuing operations

Adjustments
 — £4 million decrease
 — Certain non-underlying items relating to investment remeasurement 
gain of (£69 million), write-off of assets of £34 million, impairment of 
intangible and other assets of £32 million, separation and integration 
costs of (£9 million) and retention costs of £8 million.

Adjusted basis
 — £1,190 million
 — Adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations

Materiality
 — Materiality of £59 million (5% of materiality basis)

We determined materiality for the parent Company to be £237 million 
(2022: £228 million), which is 1% (2022: 1%) of equity of the parent 
Company. However, since the parent Company was a full scope 
component, for accounts that were relevant for the Group financial 
statements, performance materiality, as defined below, of £24 million 
was applied.

During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and 
made adjustments based on the final financial performance of  
the Group. 

Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. 
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment  
of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of our planning materiality, 
namely £44 million (2022: £46 million). We have set performance 
materiality at this percentage due to our understanding of the Group’s 
overall control environment and limited number and value of audit 
differences which were identified in the prior year audit. 

Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit 
coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The 
performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative 
scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our 
assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current 
year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components  
was £9 million to £33 million (2022: £10 million to £36 million).

Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as 
being clearly trivial.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all 
uncorrected audit differences in excess of £3 million (2022: £3 million), 
which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences  
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on  
qualitative grounds.

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of London Stock Exchange Group plc continued

Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report including the Strategic Report, Governance information and 
disclosures (including Board of Directors, Corporate governance, 
Complying with the provisions of the Code, Report of the Nomination 
Committee, Report of the Audit Committee, Report of Risk Committee, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, Directors’ Report and Statement of 
Directors’ responsibilities), other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other 
information contained within the annual report. 

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with  
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such 
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement 
in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the 
other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 — the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and 

 — the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in 

accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the 
parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic 
report or the Directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation 
to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 

Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or

 — the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 

Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or

 — certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are  

not made; or

 — we have not received all the information and explanations we require 

for our audit.

Corporate Governance Statement
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern, 
longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the Group’s compliance with the provisions of  
the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review by the 
Listing Rules.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded 
that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance 
Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained during the audit:
 — Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of  

adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 
uncertainties identified;

 — Directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the Group’s prospects, 
the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate;
 — Directors’ statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities;

 — Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable;
 — Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the 

emerging and principal risks;

 — The section of the annual report that describes the review of 

effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and;

 — The section describing the work of the audit committee.

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such 
internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible  
for assessing the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as  
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or 
to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with  
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of London Stock Exchange Group plc continued

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of 
detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, 
outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of 
not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate 
concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, 
or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable  
of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection  
of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Group 
and management. 
 — We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 

frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that  
the most significant are the UK adopted International Accounting 
Standards, United Kingdom Accounting Standards, the UK Companies 
Act 2006, UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, The Financial 
Conduct Authority’s (FCA) Listing Rules, other relevant FCA rules and 
regulations, Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, European 
Markets Infrastructure Regulations, and tax legislation (governed by 
HM Revenue and Customs). The Group operates in multiple countries 
and locations around the world which are regulated by the local 
regulator and is required to comply with local frameworks. 

 — We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks 

by making inquiries of senior management, including the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group General 
Counsel, the Chief Risk Officer, the Group Head of Compliance,  
and the Group Head of Internal Audit. We reviewed significant 
correspondence between the Group and regulatory bodies,  
reviewed minutes of the Board and Risk Committee and gained an 
understanding of the Group’s approach to governance, demonstrated 
by the Board’s approval of the Group’s governance framework and 
the Board’s review of the Group’s risk management framework and 
internal control processes. We also carried out an assessment of 
matters reported through the Group’s whistleblowing programmes 
where these related to the financial statements. 

 — We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s and parent Company’s 
financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud 
might occur by considering the controls that the Group has 
established to address risks identified by the Group, or that otherwise 
seek to prevent, deter or detect fraud. We considered performance 
and incentive plan targets and their potential to influence 
management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions  
of investors. Our procedures over our key audit matters and other 
significant accounting estimates included challenging management 
on the assumptions and judgements made in determining these 
estimates. We identified and tested journal entries, including those 
posted with certain descriptions or unusual characteristics, backdated 
journals or posted by infrequent and unexpected users. 

 — Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures  

to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations.  
Our procedures involved inquiries of senior management, the  
Group General Counsel, the Chief Risk Officer, the Group Head of 
Compliance and internal audit, review of significant correspondence 
with regulatory bodies, minutes of meetings of the Board and certain 
Board committees, the whistleblowing log, and focused testing,  
as referred to in the key audit matters section above. 

 — The Group operates in the exchange, benchmarks and central 

clearing counterparty industries which are regulated environments.  
As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor reviewed the experience and 
expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the 
appropriate competence and capabilities, which included the use of 
specialists where appropriate.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditor’s report.

Other matters we are required to address
 — Following the recommendation from the Audit Committee, we were 

appointed as auditors of the Group and signed an engagement letter 
on 12 June 2014 and were appointed by the Group at the AGM on  
16 July 2014, to audit the financial statements for the nine months 
period ended 31 December 2014 and subsequent financial periods. 
We signed an updated engagement letter on 25 October 2021 to 
audit and report on the financial statements of London Stock 
Exchange Group Plc and its subsidiaries for the year ended  
31 December 2021 and subsequent financial periods. 

 — The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointments is nine years and nine months, 
covering the nine-month period ended 31 December 2014 to the  
year ended 31 December 2023.

 — The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the  

audit committee.

Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Group’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body,  
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Reporting entity

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared for 
London Stock Exchange Group plc (the "Company") and its subsidiaries 
(the "Group"). The Group is a diversified global financial markets 
infrastructure and data business. The Company is a public company, 
incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The address of  
its registered office is 10 Paternoster Square, London, EC4M 7LS.

1. Accounting policies

This section describes our material accounting policy information  
and significant accounting judgements and estimates that relate  
to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy  
or a significant accounting judgement or estimate is applicable to  
a specific note to the financial statements, it is disclosed in that note. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods 
presented, unless otherwise stated. We have also detailed below  
the new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future  
years and how we have assessed the impact of climate change on  
our financial statements.

1.1 Compliance with International Financial Reporting  
Standards (IFRS)
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards  
which are endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board.

1.2 Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost basis 
except for derivative financial instruments, debt and equity financial 
assets and contingent consideration which are measured at fair value.

Going concern 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

The Group’s business activities (together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position), its objectives, 
policies in managing risk and its capital are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 2 to 89. In addition:
 — the Group’s borrowing facilities and respective repayment dates,  

and the net debt position of the Group, are included in note 16; and
 — the financial risk management objectives and policies of the Group, 

together with its exposure to capital, credit and concentration, 
country, liquidity, settlement, custodial and market risk are discussed 
in note 17.5.

Business planning process
The Group’s forecasting and planning process includes the Group’s 
three-year business plan. The business plan makes certain assumptions 
about the performance of the core revenue streams and segments,  
the use of existing product lines and the take up of new product lines.  
It also makes assumptions on appropriate levels of investment to 
support expected performance, known inorganic activity, the ability to 
refinance debt as required and expected returns to shareholders.

During 2023, the Group acquired the businesses listed below.  
The results of these businesses have been consolidated from  
the date of acquisition (see note 21).

Performance management
The Group’s performance is analysed monthly by management.  
Monthly results are reviewed and compared against the business plan, 
and previous and updated full year forecasts are also assessed. Key 
variances and associated drivers are reviewed and reported upon.

Cash flows and liquidity headroom
When performing our going concern assessment, the main factors 
considered are forecasts of the Group’s cash flow and liquidity 
headroom (defined as undrawn committed facilities less issued 
commercial paper plus available cash), both of which are outputs of  
the business plan. The business plan is stress tested using severe but 
plausible downside scenarios as determined by the Financial Risk 
Committee over the full three-year plan period. The impact of these 
stress tests on the performance of core revenue streams and segments 
is modelled, with appropriate mitigating factors also considered. The 
outputs of this stress-testing on the Group’s cash flow and liquidity  
are then evaluated against thresholds set by the Group’s risk appetite. 
These thresholds include liquidity headroom and leverage ratio 
(operating net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA) and before  
foreign exchange gains or losses).

The scenarios modelled are included in the viability statement on  
page 89.

No scenario over the three-year period leads to a breach in the Group’s 
risk appetite thresholds or would mean the Group is unable to meet its 
obligations as a result of insufficient liquidity. 

A reverse stress test has also been completed, to evaluate the  
financial impacts that would breach the Group’s risk appetite thresholds. 
We concluded that the scenarios required to breach the thresholds  
are all deemed improbable.

Conclusion
The Directors, therefore, consider there to be no material uncertainties 
that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue to 
operate as a going concern. The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for 12 months from the date when these financial 
statements are authorised for issue. Accordingly, the going concern 
basis has been adopted in the preparation of these financial statements.

1. Accounting policies continued

Presentation of income statement
The Group uses a columnar format for the presentation of its 
consolidated income statement to separately identify results before  
non-underlying items (“adjusted”). This is consistent with the way that 
financial performance is measured by management and reported to  
the Executive Committee and Board (see note 2).

Current and non-current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based  
on current and non-current classification. An asset is current when it is:
 — Held primarily for trading purposes;
 — Expected to be realised within one year from the reporting date;
 — Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in  

the course of the Group’s operating cycle; or

 — Cash or cash equivalents.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets

1.3 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements 
of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are consolidated  
from the date on which control is obtained by the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases. Control is 
achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee. The results of subsidiaries 
are consolidated for the period to 31 December, even if the subsidiary’s 
financial year-end is different.

The acquisition method of accounting is used by the Group to account 
for business combinations (see note 21). Non-controlling interests  
in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the 
consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income, 
balance sheet and statement of changes in equity (see note 19).

Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies  
are eliminated on consolidation. Where necessary, adjustments are 
made to the results of subsidiaries and associates to bring their 
accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

1.4 Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling,  
which is also the functional currency of London Stock Exchange Group 
plc, the Company. The Group determines the functional currency  
for each of its subsidiary entities and items included in the financial 
statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.

1.5 New and amended standards and interpretations
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published  
standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2023
During the year, the following amendments to standards became 
effective. These have not had a material impact on the Group’s  
financial statements:
 — IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, including amendments to IFRS 17  

(and initial application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – 
comparative information);

 — Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and  
IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of accounting policies;

 — Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 

Estimates and Errors: Definition of accounting estimates;

 — Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred tax related to  

assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction; and

 — Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: International Tax Reform –  
Pillar Two Model Rules. The Amendments introduce a mandatory 
temporary exception from the recognition and disclosure of deferred 
taxes arising from implementation of the Pillar Two Model Rules. The 
Group has applied this mandatory temporary exception (see note 6).

Standards, interpretations and amendments to published  
standards which are not yet effective
New and amended standards that have been issued, but are not  
yet effective, up to the date of the Group’s financial statements are 
disclosed below. We intend to adopt these, if applicable, when they 
become effective. These amendments are not expected to have  
a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.

Transactions and balances in foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded and translated 
into the functional currency of the relevant Group entity at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective 
functional currency of the entity at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
reporting date. 

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of 
such foreign currency transactions or from the translation of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised 
in the income statement, either within operating expenses or finance 
income or costs, depending on the nature of the item or transaction.

Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are not retranslated. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate at the date 
when the fair value was determined. The foreign exchange gain or loss 
on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the 
fair value gain or loss. This means:
 — foreign exchange gains and losses on non-monetary assets and 
liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised  
in the income statement (within operating expenses); and

 — foreign exchange gains and losses on non-monetary assets classified 
as at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised 
in other comprehensive income.

Translation of non-sterling entities on consolidation
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have  
a non-sterling functional currency are translated into sterling on 
consolidation into the Group’s results as follows:
 — assets and liabilities (including goodwill, purchased intangible  

assets and fair value adjustments1) are translated at the reporting  
date exchange rates;

 — income and expenses and other comprehensive income are 

translated at the average exchange rate for each month. Where this 
average is not a reasonable approximation of the rate prevailing on 
the date of a material transaction, these items are translated at the 
rate on the date of the transaction; and

 — all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other 

comprehensive income.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of 
net investments in foreign operations, borrowings and other currency 
instruments designated as hedging instruments (see note 17.4) are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign 
currency operation, the cumulative exchange differences previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that operation 
are reclassified to the income statement as part of the profit or loss  
on disposal.

1  Any goodwill and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the reporting date exchange rate.

1.6 Significant accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the 
accompanying disclosures. Estimates, assumptions and judgements  
are regularly reviewed based on historical experience, current 
circumstances and expectations of future events. As the use of 
estimates is inherent in financial reporting, actual results could differ 
from these estimates.

Significant accounting estimates and assumptions are those that have  
a risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year. 

Significant judgements are those made by management in applying  
the Group’s significant accounting policies that have a material impact 
on the amounts presented in the financial statements. Significant 
judgement may be exercised in management’s accounting estimates 
and assumptions.

Estimates, assumptions and judgements are described in the  
relevant notes to the financial statements (identified by the  
following symbol 

)

1.7 Climate change
We have considered the impact of climate change on the Group’s 
operations as outlined in the risks disclosed on pages 63 to 68 of the 
Strategic Report as well as in the Sustainability Report. We have also 
reviewed the potential impact of climate change on the Group’s financial 
results and position. The areas that are deemed to be most relevant to 
climate change are set out below. Based on an assessment in each 
area, we have concluded that climate change is not currently expected 
to have a material impact on the Group’s financial position, estimates  
or judgements. The directors monitor this on an ongoing basis.
 — Going concern and viability – The Group has committed to  

a long-term ambition to achieve net zero by 2040 and has set targets 
to reduce selected carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. There is no 
other direct impact on the viability of the Group. There is no climate-
related scenario that is deemed to have a probable likelihood of 
occurring which could impact the Group’s going concern assessment.

 — Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets – Forecasted cash 

flows are not expected to be impacted materially by climate change 
over the period for which forecasts have been prepared, due to the 
nature of the Group’s revenue streams. The impact on costs mainly 
relates to reducing our carbon footprint by encouraging responsible 
employee travel and purchasing carbon credits.

 — Useful lives of assets – The Group’s assets consist mainly of  

property and IT equipment. Given the type of IT equipment owned  
by the Group, there is no expected impact of climate change on the 
future useful lives of these assets. The useful lives of our property 
could be impacted by climate change in the form of physical 
obsolescence of assets or because of a natural disaster (such as 
flooding), however any such impact on the carrying value of related 
assets is not deemed material.

 — Deferred tax assets – Deferred tax asset recoverability can be 

affected by climate if there is an expectation that it will impact on the 
future taxable profits that are expected to be generated. The revenue 
of the Group is of such a nature that it is not expected to be impacted 
materially by climate change over the period for which forecasts are 
prepared. There is a potential reduction in costs as we reduce our 
carbon footprint and encourage responsible employee travel.

 — Valuation of pension scheme assets and defined benefit liabilities 
– Changes in interest rates, as a result of climate change, could 
impact the future valuation of pension scheme assets and defined 
benefit liabilities. While these are considered in the valuation,  
there was no discernible impact from climate change on the  
current year’s valuation.

 — Trade and other receivables – The Group has a diverse client base 
that operates in various industries. The Group’s expected credit loss 
provision considers the credit risk of its client base, which could be 
impacted by the assessment of climate change in a particular market 
or industry. Given that receivables are mainly due within one year, the 
impact of climate change in the short term is unlikely to be material.

 — Revenue – We provide a range of climate-related products and 
services such as admission on the voluntary carbon market and  
the sustainable bond market. Revenue earned from these are not 
deemed material revenue streams, but support the Group in  
enabling others to purchase carbon credits to aid in the fight  
against climate change.

 — Expenses – To support our long-term ambition to achieve net zero, 
the Group purchases carbon credits to offset the impact of the 
Group’s carbon emissions. The cost of purchasing these has been 
minimal during the current year, as credits purchased during prior 
years were sufficient to cover emissions during the current financial 
year. Any additional credits required will be purchased once the 
Group’s emissions for the year have been calculated.

2. Segment information

The Group reports three main operating segments:
 — Data & Analytics – provider of financial data, indices and analytics
 — Capital Markets – global operator of capital raising and trading venues in multiple asset classes
 — Post Trade – provider of clearing, risk management and capital optimisation solutions

With effect from 2024, we are changing our reporting structure, simplifying our Data & Analytics reporting under product lines and aligning 
divisional disclosure with new management reporting lines.

These measures are not measures of performance under IFRS and 
should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for,  
IFRS measures of financial performance and liquidity. Adjusted 
performance measures provide supplemental data relevant to an 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance and exclude 
non-underlying items of income and expense that are material by 
their size and/or nature (see note 2.3).

1  Adjusted profit for the year is used to calculate adjusted EPS and is reconciled to profit 

before taxation in the EPS note and on the face of the income statement.

Accounting policy
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be 
identified on the same basis as is reported internally for the review  
of performance and allocation of resources by the “chief operating 
decision maker”. For the Group, this is the Executive Committee.

The Executive Committee uses “adjusted” measures including 
adjusted EBITDA to assess the profitability and performance of  
the operating segments.

The “adjusted” measures reported by the Group are:
 — Adjusted operating expenses before depreciation, amortisation 

and impairment
 — Adjusted EBITDA
 — Adjusted depreciation, amortisation and impairment
 — Adjusted operating profit
 — Adjusted net finance costs
 — Adjusted profit before tax
 — Adjusted profit for the year1
 — Adjusted earnings per share (EPS)1

2.3 Non-underlying items
The Group separately identifies results before non-underlying items  
(we refer to these results as “adjusted”). This note explains the main 
non-underlying items in the year, most of which have arisen as a result 
of acquisition and subsequent integration activity.

Significant accounting judgements
The Group uses its judgement to classify items as non-underlying. 
Income or expenses are recognised and classified as  
non-underlying when the following criteria are met:
 — The item does not arise in the normal course of business; and
 — The items are material by amount or nature.

Non-underlying items include:
 — Amortisation and impairment of goodwill and purchased 
intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets include 
customer relationships, trade names, and databases and 
content, all of which are as a result of acquisitions;

 — Incremental amortisation and impairment of any fair value 
adjustments of intangible assets recognised as a result  
of acquisitions;

 — Other income or expenses not considered to drive the 

operating results of the Group including transaction, integration 
and separation costs related to acquisitions and disposals of 
businesses as well as significant restructuring costs; and
 — Tax on non-underlying items and non-underlying tax items.

When items meet the criteria, they are recognised and classified 
as non-underlying and this is applied consistently from year  
to year. Any releases to provisions originally booked as a 
non-underlying item are also classified as non-underlying.

After the acquisition of a business, revenue generated and 
operating costs incurred by that business are not classified  
as non-underlying.

Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets of £1,205 million 
(2022: £1,044 million) mainly relates to the amortisation of intangible 
assets recognised as a result of the acquisition of Refinitiv.

We have continued to review our property needs following the 
acquisition of Refinitiv. This has resulted in impairment of right-of-use 
property assets of £22 million (2022: £12 million).

The non-underlying tax benefit of £378 million (2022: £278 million) 
mainly reflects the tax impact of the Group’s non-underlying items 
(computed based on the tax rates applicable to the respective 
territories).

3. Total income and contract liabilities

We report total income, which consists of revenue, net treasury income 
and other income. Most of the Group’s revenue is generated by the 
Data & Analytics division. By geographic location, around two-thirds  
of the Group’s revenue is earned in the UK and USA.

3.1. Total income

Accounting policy
Revenue
The main source of revenue for the Group is fees for services 
provided. Revenue is measured based on the consideration 
specified in a contract with a customer. The following are 
excluded from revenue:
 — value added tax and other sales related taxes;
 — certain revenue share arrangements (whereby as part of  

an agreement amounts are due back to the customer); and
 — certain pass-through costs where the Group acts as an agent 

and has arrangements to recover specific costs from its 
customers with no mark-up.

The Group recognises revenue as services are performed  
and as it satisfies its obligations to provide a product or service  
to a customer. The Group’s revenue accounting policies are  
set out below:

Transaction costs mainly relate to the following:
 — Acadia and Yieldbroker acquisition costs – £10 million  

(2022: £3 million) (see note 21.4).

 — Employment-linked management incentives for the MayStreet Inc. 

(MayStreet) and TORA Holdings, Inc. (TORA) acquisitions,  
and MayStreet earn-out arrangement costs – £34 million  
(2022: £25 million).

 — Fair value gain on the contingent consideration payable resulting  

from the acquisition of Quantile Group Limited (Quantile) in  
2022 – £17 million (2022: nil).

 — Refinitiv acquisition costs – £39 million (2022: £36 million) mainly 
relating to changes in the tax indemnity receivable from and  
payable to Thomson Reuters.

Integration and separation costs mainly consist of costs  
to integrate Refinitiv of £209 million (2022: £242 million) and other 
recent acquisitions.

Prior to the acquisition of Acadia on 31 March 2023, LSEG held a 14% 
equity interest in Acadia. The acquisition date fair value of the previously 
held interest resulted in a remeasurement gain of £69 million (see note 
21.1). In 2022, the acquisition of Global Data Consortium, Inc. (GDC)

Data & 
Analytics

The Data & Analytics division generates revenue by providing information and data products including indexes, benchmarks, real-time pricing 
data and trade reporting and reconciliation services.

Data subscription and index licence fees are recognised over the licence or usage period in line with the Group’s obligation to deliver data 
consistently throughout the licence period. Services are billed on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 

Other information services include licences to the regulatory news service and reference data businesses. Revenue from licences that grant  
the right to access intellectual property are recognised over time, consistent with the pattern of the service provision and how the performance 
obligation is satisfied throughout the licence period. Revenues from the sale of right to use licences are recognised at the point the licence is 
granted or service is delivered.

Various brokerage processing, risk solutions and professional services, which are generally billed in arrears, are recognised as revenue at the 
point in time when the Group meets its obligation to complete the transaction or service.

Recoveries consist of fees for third-party content, such as exchange data that is distributed directly to customers, and communications fees. 
Recoveries are generally recognised over the contract term.

Capital 
Markets

Revenue in the Capital Markets division is generated from: Primary and Secondary market services; contracts to develop capital market 
technology solutions; software licences; network connections; and hosting services.

We have assessed that primary market initial admission and the ongoing listing services represent one performance obligation. The Group 
therefore recognises revenue from initial admission and any subsequent issues over the period that the Group provides the listing services.  
All admission fees are billed to the customer at the time of admission to trading and become payable when invoiced.

The estimated period for listing services (over which initial admission fees are spread) is determined with reference to historical analysis of listing 
durations in respect of the companies on our markets. The estimated service period inherently incorporates an element of uncertainty in relation 
to the length of a customer listing, which is subject to factors outside the Group’s control. It also includes a forward-looking element in respect  
of the expected listing period based on market movements. We reassess the estimated service periods at each reporting date. The current 
estimated deferral period is five years or seven years, depending on the market. Deferral periods are calculated by grouping contracts based on 
similar performance obligations. We estimate that a one-year decrease in the deferral period would cause an estimated £25 million increase in 
revenue and a one-year increase in the deferral period would cause an estimated £24 million decrease in revenue recognised in the year.

Primary market annual fees, secondary market membership and subscription fees are generally paid in advance on the first day of 
membership or the subscription period. The Group recognises revenue on a straight-line basis over the period to which the fee relates,  
as this reflects the extent of the Group’s progress towards completion of the performance obligation under the contract. 

Revenue from secondary market trading and associated capital market services is recognised on a per transaction basis at the point that  
the service is provided.

Capital markets software licence contracts contain multiple deliverables including: providing licences; installing software; and ongoing 
maintenance services. The transaction price for each contract is allocated to these performance obligations based upon the relative standalone 
selling price. Revenue is recognised based on the actual service provided during the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be 
provided. This is determined by measuring the inputs consumed in delivering the service (for example material and labour) relative to the total 
expected input consumption over the contract. This best reflects the transfer of economic benefits to the customer which generally occurs as  
the Group incurs costs on the contract.

Transaction and commission fees are earned from transactions that are executed on the Group's electronic marketplaces. Revenue is 
recognised on the transaction date which is when performance obligations are deemed to have been satisfied. For variable transaction fees  
and commissions, this represents a fee based on the mix of products and the volume of transactions previously traded or executed when an 
individual transaction occurs. Revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the revenue will  
not occur (‘minimum expected revenue’).

Network connection, subscription and hosting services revenues are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period to which the fee 
relates as this reflects the continuous transfer of technology services and measures the extent of progress towards the completion of the 
performance obligation.

Revenue in the Post Trade division is generated from clearing, settlement and other post trade services.

Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and securities clearing and reporting generate fees from: individual transactions or contracts cleared and 
settled; transaction reporting; risk management; and other financial resources management services. These revenues are earned at the point  
in time when the Group meets its obligations to complete the transaction or service. Revenue is recognised and billed monthly in arrears.  
Certain customers have a fixed-fee arrangement which is not linked to individual transactions and this revenue is recognised over time as  
the Group fulfils its obligations to maintain the availability of the clearing system to that customer.

Non-cash collateral fees are earned from handling non-cash collateral balances. The fees are recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis 
over the service period, representing the continuous transfer of services during that time.

Fees received for third-party content or services, such as settlement fees, are recognised net within revenue on the date of the transaction.

3. Total income and contract liabilities continued

Those customer contracts across the Group that contain a single 
performance obligation at a fixed price do not require variable 
consideration to be calculated. However, some businesses in the 
Group provide services to customers under a tiered or tariff pricing 
structure that generates a degree of variability in the revenue 
streams from the contract as a result of additional charges or 
discounts given. Where the future revenue from a contract varies 
due to factors that are outside the Group’s control, the Group limits 
the total transaction price at contract inception and recognises the 
minimum expected revenue guaranteed by the terms of the contract 
over the contract period. Any variable element is subsequently 
recognised in the period in which the variable condition is satisfied 
and there is no significant risk of reversal of that revenue.

Rebates given to customers as part of an operating agreement are 
calculated on a pro-rata basis on revenue earned and recognised  
as they fall due.

The Group does not have any contracts where the period between 
the transfer of services to a customer and when the customer is 
expected to pay for that service is longer than one year. As a result, 
no adjustments are made to revenue for any financing component.

Net treasury income
Net treasury income is generated from two sources. Firstly, the CCP 
businesses securely invest the cash collateral lodged with them  
and earn treasury income from various investments (including 
government debt and reverse repos) and cash deposits with central 
banks. At the same time, the CCPs pay interest at an overnight 
benchmark rate to their members on the collateral placed with the 
business, whilst charging a spread on that rate as a fee. This spread 
provides the second source of income. The resulting net treasury 
income is recognised within total income and disclosed separately 
from revenue.

Other income
Other income typically relates to operating lease income and fees 
from service agreements. Such fees are generated from the 
provision of events and media services, which are typically 
recognised at the point the service is rendered.

Cost of sales
Cost of sales comprises:
 — Data and licence fees;
 — Data feed costs;
 — Royalties;
 — Expenses incurred in respect of profit share arrangements;
 — Costs directly attributable to the construction and delivery of 

goods or services; and

 — Any other costs linked and directly incurred to generate revenues 

and provide services to customers.

Profit share expenses recognised as cost of sales relate to  
a small number of arrangements with certain customers where  
the payment to the customer is linked to the total profit of the 
particular business concerned.

if the Group receives an advance payment from a customer.

Accounting policy
In some instances, we receive consideration, or an amount  
of consideration is due, in relation to our obligation to transfer 
goods or services to a customer in the future. Revenue relating  
to these future periods is classified as a contract liability on the 
balance sheet.

Contract liabilities are amortised and recognised as revenue

5. Net finance costs

Finance income includes interest on cash deposits and interest income 
on retirement benefit assets. Finance costs include interest on 
borrowings, interest costs on retirement benefit obligations and lease 
interest expense. Net finance costs also include foreign exchange  
gains or losses associated with corporate treasury.

Accounting policy
The accounting policies for the following finance income and 
finance costs are described in the relevant notes to the  
financial statements:

Note

 — Interest income on retirement 

12

benefit assets

 — Interest costs on retirement 

benefit obligations

Pension and other 
retirement benefit schemes

 — Interest on borrowings

 — Lease interest income
 — Lease interest expense

16.1

16.2

Borrowings

Lease liabilities and net 
investments in leases

Interest earned on cash deposited with financial counterparties 
and interest paid on borrowings, which reflects the agreed 
market-based or contractual rate for each transaction, are 
calculated using the effective interest method. Where negative 
interest rates apply, the Group recognises interest paid on cash 
deposits as an expense and interest received on borrowings  
as income.

Recurring fees and charges levied on committed bank facilities, 
cash management transactions and the payment services 
provided by the Group’s banks are charged as accrued in other 
finance costs. Credit facility arrangement fees are capitalised  
and then amortised over the term of the facility based on the 
projected utilisation of the facility.

Interest payable on bank and other borrowings is net of amortisation of the realised gain  
on interest rate derivatives held in the hedging reserve.

3  From 1 January 2023 onwards, foreign exchange related items associated with corporate 
treasury transactions and other borrowings, previously included in operating expenses 
before depreciation, amortisation and impairment, have been recognised within net finance 
costs. The 2022 results have not been restated. In 2022, operating expense before 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment had included foreign exchange gains of  
£9 million for such items.

4  For 2022, interest cost on retirement benefit obligations of £70 million had been presented 
within finance costs. This has been reclassified to net interest income on net retirement 
benefit assets to align with the accounting policy. This change has no overall impact on  
net finance costs in 2022.

6. Taxation

This note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The note also 
provides information on deferred tax and uncertain tax positions.

Accounting policy
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Current and 
deferred tax charges and benefits are recognised in the  
income statement except to the extent that they relate to items 
recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.

Current income tax is calculated based on the tax laws enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the 
countries where the Group operates and generates taxable 
income. Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured  
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to  
taxation authorities.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable  
in the future on differences between the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
corresponding amounts used for tax purposes. Deferred tax is 
accounted for using the liability method and calculated using tax 
rates that are substantively enacted and expected to apply in  
the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled.

Deferred tax is not recognised for:
 — Temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or 

liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and 
that affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit; and

 — Temporary differences arising on the initial recognition  

of goodwill.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences associated with interests in subsidiaries and 
associates, except where the Group is able to control the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary 
differences associated with such interests are recognised  
only to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient 
taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the 
temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in  
the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow  
all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date  
and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable  
that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to  
be recovered.

Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on 
different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.

On 23 May 2023, the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) issued International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules 
– Amendments to IAS 12, which the Group has adopted. The 
Amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from 
deferred tax accounting for the global minimum top-up tax, 
which is effective immediately, and require new disclosures about 
the Group’s exposure to Pillar Two income taxes (see note 6.1). 
The mandatory exception applies retrospectively to the Group 
from 1 January 2023, however the retrospective application has 
no impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

Factors affecting the tax charge for the year
On 24 May 2021, the UK Finance Act 2021 was substantively enacted, 
increasing the corporate tax rate from 19% to 25% with effect from  
1 April 2023. This means that the blended tax rate for the year ended  
31 December 2023 as a whole was 23.5%.

Tax on items recognised in other comprehensive income

Global Minimum Tax
To address concerns about uneven profit distribution and the tax 
contributions of large multinational corporations, various agreements 
have been reached at the global level, including an agreement by  
over 135 countries to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15%.  
In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation  
and Development (OECD) released a draft legislative framework, 
followed by detailed guidance in 2022 and 2023.

The Group operates globally including in jurisdictions which have 
enacted new legislation to implement the global minimum top-up  
tax. Since the newly enacted tax legislation is only effective from  
1 January 2024, there is no current tax impact for the year ended  
31 December 2023.

The Group has applied a mandatory temporary exception from deferred 
tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and will account for it as 
a current tax when it is incurred. If the new tax legislation had applied in 
2023, there would have been no material top-up tax for the Group, and 
overall the Group does not expect a material impact from these rules.

1  The intangible assets have mainly arisen from acquired subsidiaries, creating a deferred tax liability due to the difference between their accounting and tax treatment. On 31 December 2023 this 

liability was £2,668 million (2022: £2,816 million), primarily relating to the Refinitiv acquisition.

2  Tradeweb Markets LLC is a multiple member limited liability company taxed as a partnership and accordingly, any taxable income generated by Tradeweb Markets LLC is passed through to its 
members. The investment in partnership deferred tax asset is the difference between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of the Tradeweb Markets Inc. investment in Tradeweb 
Markets LLC.

On 22 November 2023, the UK Autumn Statement announced that from 6 April 2024 the free-standing tax charge that applies to authorised  
surplus payments to sponsoring employers of a registered defined benefit pension scheme will reduce from 35% to 25%. As this change is not yet 
substantively enacted, the Group utilises the 35% tax rate for deferred tax liability measurement on UK pension surpluses at the balance sheet date. 
This change would decrease the deferred tax liability by £16 million.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets
On 31 December 2023, the gross amount of unrecognised temporary differences in respect of losses available for carry forward was £127 million 
(2022: £122 million), all with unlimited expiration. 

The assets will be recognised in the future only if suitable forecast taxable profit arises within the Group.

IRS Audit
The Group is under audit in the USA by the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) in relation to the interest rate applied on certain cross-border 
intercompany loans from the UK to the USA for the 2016-2021 period. 
Management believes that resolution of this matter will not have  
a material impact on the Group’s financial position.

HMRC audit of intellectual property valuation
HMRC is auditing the value of certain intellectual property purchased 
from Thomson Reuters as part of the formation of Refinitiv. Intellectual 
property valuation is complex and significantly affected by multiple 
inputs of assumptions. As the outcome is uncertain, especially given the 
inherent subjectivity of the topic, the Group has recorded an uncertain 
tax liability in accordance with the requirements of IFRS. Management 
and HMRC have made progress but continue to actively discuss this 
topic. Management believes that resolution of this matter will not have  
a material impact on the Group’s financial position.

Diverted Profits Tax to Thomson Reuters
HMRC has issued notices of assessment under the Diverted Profits  
Tax (DPT) regime to Thomson Reuters largely related to its Financial  
& Risk Business for years prior to the sale of the business to Refinitiv.  
As required by the notices and as directed by Thomson Reuters,  
the Group has made payments to HMRC which were immediately 
reimbursed by Thomson Reuters in accordance with an indemnity 
agreement (described in note 13 and note 15). Thomson Reuters does 
not agree with the assessments. To the extent the Group receives any 
refunds of these payments, such refunds are remitted to Thomson 
Reuters in accordance with the indemnity agreement.

Russian tax audit
The Group is under audit by the Russian Tax Authorities for the 
2018-2020 period and continues to engage on this topic. We have 
recorded an uncertain tax liability in accordance with the requirements 
of IFRS. Management believes that resolution of this matter will not  
have a material impact on the Group’s financial position.

6. Taxation continued

6.3. Uncertain tax positions1

Significant accounting judgements and estimates
Uncertain tax positions
The Group is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it 
operates. The tax legislation of these countries differs, is often 
complex and can be subject to interpretation by management 
and government authorities. These matters of judgement 
sometimes give rise to the need to create provisions for tax 
payments that may arise in future years with respect to 
transactions already undertaken. 

Provisions are made against individual exposures and take  
into account the specific circumstances of each case, including 
the strength of technical arguments, recent case law decisions  
or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice.  
In accordance with IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax 
Treatments, provisions are estimated based on one of  
two methods:
 — the expected value method (the sum of the probability 
weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes); or

 — the single most likely amount method.

The method chosen depends on which is expected to better 
predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Due to the uncertainty 
associated with tax audits it is possible that, at some future date, 
liabilities resulting from such audits or related litigation could vary 
significantly from our provisions. This would require the Group  
to make an adjustment in a subsequent period which could have 
a material impact on the Group’s results.

EU State Aid
The Group continues to monitor developments in relation to EU State 
Aid investigations. On 25 April 2019, the EU Commission’s final decision 
regarding its investigation into the UK’s Controlled Foreign Company 
(CFC) regime was published. It concluded that the Finance Company 
Partial Exemption (FCPE) rules in the UK tax legislation partially represent 
illegal State Aid. The Group had financing arrangements that utilised  
the FCPE.

In December 2019 and the beginning of 2021, HMRC issued 
determinations to the Group totalling £11 million which the Group paid.

The Group, several other UK PLCs and the UK Government submitted 
appeals to the EU General Court to annul the EU Commission’s findings. 
On 8 June 2022, the EU General Court rejected the appeals. The Group 
has appealed this decision to the Court of Justice of the European 
Union (CJEU). On 10 January 2024, an oral hearing at the CJEU was 
held and a non-binding opinion from the Advocate General is expected 
to be issued in April 2024. The final decision will follow in the months 
thereafter. Until the issue is concluded, the UK Government is required 
to continue recovering amounts determined to be State Aid.

The Group’s view continues to be that no provision is required. 
Additionally, and in accordance with IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income 
Tax Treatments, the Group continues to recognise a receivable against 
the HMRC determinations paid to date of £11 million. The potential 
exposure remains between nil and £65 million.

7. Earnings per share

Earnings per share is presented on four bases: basic earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, adjusted basic earnings per share and 
adjusted diluted earnings per share. Earnings per share is calculated as the Group’s profit for the financial year divided by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the year.

Accounting policy
Basic earnings per share is in respect of all activities. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilutive effect that would arise on 
conversion or vesting of all outstanding share options and share awards under the Group’s share option and award schemes. Adjusted basic 
earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude non-underlying items from earnings.

recognised as a liability in the Group financial statements  
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders. 

Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 
2021 paid 25 May 2022: 70.0p per ordinary share

Dividends are only paid out of available distributable reserves of  
the Company.

The Board has proposed a final dividend in respect of the year ended  
31 December 2023 of 79.3p per share, which amounts to an expected 
payment of £428 million on 22 May 2024. This is not reflected in the 
financial statements.

The balance sheet includes significant intangible assets, mainly in 
relation to goodwill, customer and supplier relationships, and internally 
developed software. Goodwill arises when we acquire a business and 
pay an amount higher than the fair value of its net assets primarily due 
to the synergies we expect to create. Goodwill is not amortised but is 
subject to annual impairment reviews. Purchased and other intangible 
assets are amortised over their useful economic lives.

Accounting policy
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is initially 
measured at cost, being the amount by which the aggregate  
of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised  
for any non-controlling interests (plus any previous interest  
held), exceeds the net identifiable assets acquired and  
liabilities assumed. 

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, on the date of acquisition, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to one or more of the Group’s  
cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit  
from the combination.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the 
operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount 
when determining its gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed 
in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values 
of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained.

Purchased intangible assets
Purchased intangible assets are initially recognised at cost.  
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
is their fair value at the date of acquisition. This is determined 
using valuation methodologies such as the multi-period excess 
earnings method (MEEM) or relief from royalty. Following initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

These assets are amortised as follows:

9. Intangible assets continued

The useful economic life and amortisation method are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date. If there has been a change in the 
expected useful economic life or the expected pattern of 
consumption of future economic benefits embodied by an  
asset, then the useful economic life or amortisation method is 
changed accordingly. 

The Group considers the following indicators, as a minimum,  
that may show that the useful economic life or amortisation 
method of an asset may require a change:
 — whether there have been any changes to legal, regulatory or 

contractual provisions;

 — whether there has been any experience in renewing or 

extending related licensing agreements;

 — whether the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition or 

maintenance may impact the life of the asset;

 — the expected future performance of the business related to  

the asset; and

 — for customer and supplier relationship assets, the attrition  
rate of customers versus initial expected attrition rates set  
out at acquisition. 

Software and other
Internally developed software
Expenditure on internal product development, including 
expenditure related to cloud computing arrangements,  
is capitalised if:
 — the costs can be reliably measured; 
 — the product or process is technically and commercially feasible; 
 — future economic benefits are probable; and 
 — the Group has sufficient resources to complete the 

development and to use or sell the asset.

The assets are initially recorded at cost, which includes labour, 
directly attributable costs and any third-party expenses. They are 
then amortised over their useful economic lives of 3 to 12 years. 
The majority of material assets are amortised over a life not 
exceeding 5 years. 

Third-party software costs for the development and 
implementation of systems which enhance the services provided 
by the Group are capitalised and amortised over their estimated 
useful economic lives of 3 to 5 years.

Contract costs
Incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract, such as sales 
commissions paid to employees, are recognised as an intangible 
asset if the benefit of such costs is expected to be longer than 
one year. The asset is initially recognised at cost and is amortised 
over the period that a customer benefits from the associated 
software technology supporting the underlying product or 
service. The Group has determined this to be between  
3 and 5 years.

The Group recognises the incremental cost of obtaining  
a contract as an expense when incurred, if the amortisation 
period is less than one year.

Impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Any goodwill 
impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount 
of each CGU. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less 
than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. 
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in 
future periods.

Intangible assets are assessed for any indicators of impairment  
at each balance sheet date. If any indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group 
estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. Where it is not 
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual 
asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the  
CGU to which the asset belongs.

An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount 
of the asset, or CGU, is less than its carrying amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the income statement within 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment. CGU impairment 
losses are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.

Significant accounting estimates and assumptions
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination
The fair value of acquired intangible assets (and therefore the 
resulting goodwill recognised on acquisition) is significantly 
affected by a number of factors. These include management’s 
best estimates of future performance (i.e. forecast revenue, 
expected revenue attrition, forecast operating margin), any 
contributory assets charges and estimates of the return required 
to determine an appropriate discount rate (in order to calculate 
the net present value of the assets).

Recoverable amounts of CGUs
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are based on value-in-use 
calculations. The value-in-use calculations use cash flow 
projections based on business plans prepared by management 
for the three-year period ending 31 December 2026. In assessing 
value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and  
the risks specific to the CGUs.

Estimated useful economic lives
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful 
economic lives, being management’s best estimate of the  
period over which value from the intangible assets is realised.  
In determining useful economic life, management considers  
a number of factors including: customer attrition rates;  
product upgrade cycles for software and technology assets; 
market participant perspectives of brands; and pace of change  
of regulation.

1  The carrying value of goodwill allocated to the Data & Analytics and Tradeweb CGUs reduced during the year mainly due to the impact of foreign exchange translation of £648 million and  

£291 million, respectively. The decrease in Tradeweb is partly offset by the Yieldbroker acquisition (see note 21.2). The carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the Post Trade CGU increased 
during the year, mainly due to the Acadia acquisition (see note 21.2).

Annual goodwill impairment test
Goodwill as at 31 December 2023 was tested for impairment. For each CGU, the estimated recoverable amount is higher than its carrying value 
(being the net book value as at 31 December 2023) and therefore no impairment was identified or recognised.

The recoverable amount of each CGU was determined based on value-in-use calculations. The value-in-use calculations are based on, and most 
sensitive to, the following key assumptions:

Assumption

Determination of assumption

Short- and medium-term  
revenue and cost growth

Long-term economic  
growth rates (used to  
determine terminal values)

Pre-tax discount rates

Value-in-use assumptions

Assumptions

Long-term growth rates

Pre-tax discount rates

The short-term revenue and cost growth assumptions are based on the business plans prepared by management for  
the three-year period ending 31 December 2026 and extended by a further three years for trended medium-term growth. 
Business plans are based on an assessment of current trends, anticipated market and regulatory developments, 
discussions with customers and suppliers, and management’s experience

Cash flows beyond an initial six-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates, which are based on 
external estimates of GDP and inflation 

Weighted average cost of capital is determined using market risk free rates based on the yields of government  
bonds most relevant to the operations of the CGU, adjusted for country and operational risk and the cost of borrowing  
for the Group

The estimated value-in-use of each CGU exceeds its carrying value. The table below shows the relative changes in the main assumptions; cash 
flows, long-term growth rate and pre-tax discount rates, in isolation, that could lead to the value-in-use reducing to the carrying amount. Changes 
beyond those amounts would have therefore led to an impairment loss being recognised for the year ended 31 December 2023. The sensitivity 
analysis presented is prepared on the basis that any change in each key assumption would not have a consequential impact on other assumptions 
used. We do not expect that a reasonably possible or foreseeable change in the assumptions in isolation would lead to an impairment loss  
being recognised.

Reduction in terminal cash flow (%)

Reduction in long-term growth rates (percentage points)

10. Property, plant and equipment

Our tangible assets are property (owned and leased), equipment, and furniture and fittings. These assets are depreciated over their useful 
economic lives.

Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are recorded at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings, plant and equipment  
are depreciated to a residual value on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful economic lives as follows:
 — Freehold buildings – 30 to 50 years
 — Plant and equipment – 3 to 20 years

Leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated  
to a residual value over the shorter of the period of the lease and  
the useful economic life of the asset.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is an 
indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists,  
the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal,  
and its value-in-use. Where it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates  
the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. 

An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of the 
asset, or CGU, is less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement within depreciation, amortisation 
and impairment. CGU impairment losses are allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then  
to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on  
a pro-rata basis.

Right-of-use assets (leases)
The Group recognises a right-of-use asset where it has control of an 
asset for a period of more than 12 months. Assets are recorded initially 
at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the 
lease term and the estimated useful economic life. Cost is defined as 
the net present value of the initial lease liability plus any initial costs 
and dilapidation provisions less any lease incentives received.

The lease term is the non-cancellable term plus any periods for which 
the Group is reasonably certain to exercise any extension options.

Where a property is no longer used by the business or there is  
surplus space, an impairment in the value of the right-of-use asset  
is recognised and the asset is recognised at its estimated  
recoverable value.

Where a lease is terminated early, this is recognised as a disposal and 
any difference in value between the asset (being the carrying value of 
the right-of-use asset) and the liability (being the net present value of 
future lease obligation) is recognised as a profit or loss on disposal. 
Any penalty fees payable for early termination are recognised  
directly in the income statement as an operating expense.

11. Investments in financial assets

The Group holds equity investments in a number of companies which 
fall below the level that would result in recognition of an interest in  
a subsidiary or associate.

Accounting policy
These financial assets are all recognised at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVOCI). See note 17 for the 
relevant accounting policy, specifically in relation to:
 —  equity instruments
 —  debt instruments

Investments in equity instruments and convertible instruments 
(excluding listed instruments) are classified as Level 3 (of the fair 
value hierarchy described in the accounting policy of note 17). 
Listed instruments are classified as Level 1.

Fair value of equity instruments
In determining the fair value of equity instruments, recent market 
transactions are used as the primary source of an instrument’s value.  
If no such transactions can be identified, latest financial performance is 
compared with expectation to determine whether the value continues  
to be supported. If actual financial performance has deviated materially 
from expectation, internal valuations are calculated using a range of 
appropriate valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows 
and trading/transaction multiples. These valuation models generate  
a range of values by considering reasonable changes in the key 
unobservable inputs (e.g. terminal growth rates and discount rates).  
The investments are recognised at the lowest value in the range.

The fair values of the material investments are as follows:

12. Pension and other retirement benefit schemes

Substantially all of the Group’s employees participate in defined benefit or defined contribution future benefit schemes. 

This note describes the retirement benefit costs recognised in the income statement, and assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet.

Accounting policy
For defined contribution schemes, the operating charge 
represents the contributions payable in the year and is 
recognised in the income statement as incurred.

For the defined benefit schemes the income statement expense 
is allocated between service cost and net finance expense.  
The service charge represents benefits accruing to employees 
and is included as an operating expense.

Costs of future employee benefits are accrued over the period  
in which employees earn the benefits. Scheme obligations and 
costs are determined on a regular basis by an independent 
qualified actuary, in line with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, using the 
projected unit credit method. The obligations are measured by 
discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out 
of the scheme and are reflected in the Group balance sheet.

Net interest is recognised within net finance costs, calculated  
by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit asset or 
liability at the start of each annual reporting period. The discount 
rate used is based on market interest rates of high-quality, 
fixed-rate debt securities adjusted to reflect the duration of 
expected future cash outflows for pension benefit payments. 

The net asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet 
comprises the difference between the present value of pension 
obligations and the fair value of scheme assets.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised at each reporting date, 
net of tax, in the statement of comprehensive income. These 
gains and losses arise from experience adjustments, changes  
in actuarial assumptions or differences between actual and 
expected returns on assets.

Significant accounting judgements
The Group judges that, on the winding up of the defined benefit 
schemes, it can expect any remaining pension surplus to be 
refunded in full to the Group. In line with the current accounting 
standards, it therefore continues to recognise these retirement 
benefit assets on the balance sheet in full.

Significant accounting estimates and assumptions
Defined benefit pension liabilities are determined based on the 
present value of future pension obligations using assumptions 
determined by the Group with advice from an independent 
qualified actuary. An actuarial valuation involves making various 
assumptions that may differ from what actually happens in  
the future. 

The assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts 
reported are the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth and 
mortality levels. Assumptions about these variables are based  
on the environment in each country. Due to the complexities 
involved in a valuation, and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.  
In particular, changes to the discount rate and inflation rate,  
could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the 
Group’s pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations 
within the next financial year.

Defined contribution schemes 
Defined contribution schemes are savings plans that provide for 
matching contributions from the Group. Most new employees are 
eligible to participate in these schemes. The main scheme within  
the Group is the London Stock Exchange Group Pension Plan.

Defined benefit schemes
Defined benefit schemes provide pension and other post-retirement 
benefits for covered employees. Benefits are payable generally based 
on salary and years of service, although each plan has a unique benefits 
formula and in some open schemes employees may also make 
voluntary contributions to augment future benefits. The retirement age  
is typically in the range of 60 and 65 years and benefits are generally 
payable as an annuity or lump sum upon retirement. Most schemes 
include provisions for early retirement or death and include survivor  
and disability benefits. Vested benefits of former employees who are  
not yet of retirement age are held in deferment. Eligible benefits are 
subject to increases based on inflation.

Except when required by law, virtually all defined benefit schemes are 
closed to new employees. All schemes are governed by the local 
regulatory framework and employment laws in the country in which  
they operate. 

The Group’s largest defined benefit plans are in the UK and together are 
in a net surplus position. The most significant defined benefit schemes 
(collectively referred to as the “Large UK” schemes) are:
 — the Reuters Pension Fund (RPF);
 — the Reuters Supplementary Pension Scheme (SPS); and
 — the London Stock Exchange Group Pension Scheme (LSEGPS)

 — LSE Section of LSEGPS (previously the London Stock Exchange 

Retirement Plan)

 — LCH Section of LSEGPS (previously the LCH Pension Scheme).

1  As at 31 December 2023, the Group recognised net defined benefit assets on the basis that 
the Group would have access to the surplus in the event of a winding-up of the scheme.  
No asset ceiling has therefore been applied to the net surplus recognised. The LSE Section 
of the LSEGPS is the only UK scheme to have minimum funding commitments however, 
based on the latest analysis carried out by the scheme actuary, no funding contribution  
was required from the Group in 2023.

2  On 16 June 2023, the High Court issued a ruling in respect of Virgin Media v NTL Pension 

Trustees II Limited (and others) calling into question the validity of rule amendments made to 
defined benefit pension schemes contracted-out on a Reference Scheme Test basis between 
6 April 1997 and 5 April 2016. Amendments to these pension schemes over this time required 
confirmation from the Scheme Actuary that the Reference Scheme Test would continue  
to be met. In the absence of such a confirmation, the Rule amendment would be void.  
The Group is waiting for the outcome of the appeal and any additional hearings, as well as 
confirmation from the Government as to whether it will issue new regulations in response. 
The Group is considering, with the Trustees of the Large UK schemes, the impact on the 
pension schemes. No reliable estimate can be made at this stage and no impact is included 
in these disclosed benefit scheme liabilities.

12.4 Large UK schemes
The detail that follows relates to the Large UK schemes. In this section 
we show the movement of the scheme assets and defined benefit 
obligations in the year, alongside the asset classes and expected 
benefit payments. We also explain the schemes’ investment policy,  
key assumptions and risk management.

1  On 1 September 2022, the RPF was closed to future accrual. All 121 remaining active 

members accepted the new terms and conditions, and their status changed to deferred. 
They were automatically enrolled into the London Stock Exchange Group Pension Plan 
(defined contribution scheme), unless they opted out. This constituted an “exit” and triggered 
curtailment. The RPF has a partial buy-in arrangement in place amounting to £398 million 
(2022: £404 million).

2  On 30 September 2021, the Trustee of SPS entered into a bulk annuity policy with Legal  

& General (L&G) covering all of the scheme’s deferred and retiree obligations. The purpose 
of the arrangement is to reduce pension volatility by transferring longevity risk to L&G and 
further improve inflation risk and the matching of assets and liabilities. As at 31 December 
2023, the SPS buy-in amounted to £194 million (2022: £182 million).

3  On 18 May 2023, the Trustee of the LSEGPS entered into a bulk annuity policy with Standard 

Life, part of Phoenix Group, broadly insuring all scheme benefits that were not already 
insured with PIC. The purpose of the arrangement is to reduce pension volatility by 
transferring longevity risk to Standard Life and further improve inflation risk and the matching 
of assets and liabilities. As at 31 December 2023, the LSE and LCH Sections of the LSEGPS 
buy-in amounted to £286 million and £148 million, respectively.

Investment policy
The Group bears the cost of the Large UK schemes (less employee 
contributions). However, the responsibility for managing and governing 
the Large UK schemes lies with the independent trustee board 
(Trustees). Scheme Trustees set investment policies and strategies for 
each plan and oversee investment allocation. This includes selecting 
investment managers, commissioning periodic asset-liability studies,  
and setting long-term targets. The scheme Trustees may consult with 
the Group in setting investment policy, but the Trustees are ultimately 
accountable for it.

The principal investment objectives are to:
 —  ensure funds are available to pay pension benefits as they  

become due under a broad range of future economic scenarios;
 —  maximise long-term investment return with an acceptable level  

of risk; and

 —  diversify across capital markets to insulate asset values against risk  

in any one market.

Investment allocation
Investment allocation takes into account a number of factors, including: 
the funded status of the scheme; setting the right balance between  
risk and return; the scheme’s liquidity needs; current and expected 
economic and market conditions; specific asset class risk; as well as  
the risk profile and maturity pattern of the scheme.

Target investment allocation ranges provide guidelines, not limitations. 
Plans may have diversified portfolios with investments in equities,  
fixed income, real estate, insurance contracts, derivatives, and other 
asset classes through direct ownership or through other instruments 
such as mutual funds, commingled funds, and hedge funds. Derivatives 
may be used to achieve investment objectives or as a component  
of risk management (such as for interest rate and currency  
management strategies).

1  The Group contributed £6 million (2022: £21 million) to its Large UK schemes. The Group 
expects to contribute approximately £7 million to its Large UK schemes in 2024. For RPF,  
the Trustees have the right to call for special valuations, which could subsequently result in 
the Group having to make an unexpected contribution. Market-related factors may also affect 
the timing and amount of contributions.

12. Pension and other retirement benefit schemes continued

The Trustees invest the schemes’ assets in a portfolio of physical assets 
and liability-matching assets:
 —  The physical assets have the objective of outperforming the liabilities 
by investing in a suitably diversified range of assets, consisting of risk 
premia strategies, corporate bonds (and other credit alternatives) and 
property which together are expected to reduce investment volatility.
 —  The liability-matching assets seek to hedge against the interest rate 

and inflation risks associated with liabilities. The assets are 
predominantly gilts, both nominal and index-linked. The SPS and 
LSEGPS also include bulk annuity transactions (buy-ins) insuring the 
benefit for a part of the schemes’ liabilities. The RPF has partial buy-in.

The assets held by the RPF mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents, 
government and corporate bonds, and various investment vehicles.  
Plan assets are invested to adequately secure benefits and to minimise 
the need for long-term contributions to the schemes. The SPS and the 
LSEGPS are fully bought-in and therefore hold cash, buy-in contracts 
and some liquid assets.

Funding valuations and arrangements
The Trustees are responsible for carrying out triennial valuations (unless 
circumstances require an earlier review) and securing funding for benefit 
payments. In order to develop funding valuations and investment 
policies, the Trustees consult with the schemes’ actuary (who is 
independent of the Group’s actuary), the schemes’ investment advisors 
(also independent of the Group’s investment advisors) and the Group. 

The Group has provided guarantees to the Trustees of the RPF and to 
the Trustees of the SPS in conjunction with triennial valuation and 
funding obligations. As at 31 December 2023, the aggregate maximum 
liability under the guarantees was £700 million for the RPF and  
£120 million for the SPS. These amounts are unchanged from last year.

Actuarial assumptions
The Group used the following weighted-average assumptions in 
determining the defined benefit obligation for the large UK schemes:

Discount rate

 — Non-insured

 — Insured 

Price inflation

Rate of increase in salaries

Life expectancy from age 65 (years)

 — Non-retired male member

 — Non-retired female member

 — Retired male member

 — Retired female member

Sensitivity analysis
The measurement of the Large UK schemes obligations is sensitive  
to changes in certain key assumptions. The sensitivity analysis below 
shows how a reasonably possible increase in a particular assumption 
would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2023.

1  The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the scheme 

obligations as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one 
another. The analysis is done in a similar way to calculating the scheme obligations 
recognised in the balance sheet in that it uses the projected unit credit method at the end  
of the year.

schemes continued

Risks for the defined benefit schemes and risk mitigation
Some key financial risks for the defined benefit schemes are:
 — if there is a reduction in corporate bond yields. This increases  
the schemes’ liabilities which may not be accompanied by  
a corresponding increase in the schemes’ assets;

 — if investment returns are lower than assumed. Only the RPF invests  
a proportion of its assets in growth assets so a fall in the value of 
these assets will worsen the schemes’ funding position;

 — if inflation is higher than expected, or average inflation expectations 
increase. This will increase the liabilities through higher indexing of 
pension payments; and

 — if members live longer than expected. This would increase the length 

of time for which pensions have to be paid.

An increase in pension liabilities could lead to an increase in the 
pension deficit or a reduction in any surplus. Defined benefit schemes 
are normally revalued by actuaries every three years. Where any 
material funding gap is identified by this process, the Trustees will  
agree a schedule of contributions with the sponsor company. Such 
contributions would have a financial impact on the Group.

In addition, for the RPF, SPS and LSEGPS, the Group is exposed to the 
creditworthiness of the buy-in insurance provider. A failure of the buy-in 
insurance provider would reduce the pension assets and could lead to  
a pension deficit materialising, or an increase in the pension deficit and 
the need for contributions from the Group.

The RPF holds a range of liquid assets that can be sold for use as 
collateral for the liability-matching assets if required, and the Trustees 
consider the liquidity needs of the schemes when setting investment 
strategy. The schemes’ investment strategies have performed as 
expected during the market volatility that followed the UK Government’s 
mini budget on 23 September 2022. The RPF Trustee makes use of 
liability-driven investments, but there was no interruption to the interest 
rate and inflation hedges in place. The SPS and LSEGPS do not hold  
any liability-driven investments as they hold bulk annuity policies.

13. Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by 
customers and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance. This 
note includes finance lease receivables recognised where the Group 
acts as a lessor. See note 16.2 for more information on the Group’s 
leasing activities.

Accounting policy
Trade receivables are initially recognised at the amount of the 
consideration that is unconditionally due to the Group. They are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any expected 
credit loss (ECL). Our approach to calculating ECL provisions is 
described in note 17. The creation and release of such provisions 
are recognised in operating expenses in the income statement.

Fees receivable are recognised when the Group has an 
unconditional right to consideration in exchange for goods  
or services transferred, but no fee invoice has been issued. 
Amounts are transferred to trade receivables when an invoice 
has been issued.

Other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost, less any loss allowance as 
described in note 17.

When a receivable is no longer expected to be recovered, the full 
amount is written off. We will continue to seek recovery and any 
subsequent amounts recovered against amounts previously 
written off are recognised in the income statement.

See note 16.2 for the net investment in leases accounting  
policy, when the Group sub-lets property right-of-use assets  
to a third-party.

The Group has a tax indemnity agreement with Thomson Reuters 
for any tax liabilities incurred and tax receivables due before 
Refinitiv (previously the Thomson Reuters Financial & Risk 
Business) separated from Thomson Reuters on 1 October 2018. 
The tax indemnity receivable is recognised for and measured  
on the same basis as the corresponding indemnified tax liabilities. 
The indemnified tax liabilities are recognised within current tax 
payable in the balance sheet. When there is a change in  
the indemnified tax liabilities, which is recognised within tax  
(as non-underlying) in the income statement, there is an  
offsetting change in the tax indemnity receivable. This change is 
recognised within operating expenses in the income statement 
and classified as non-underlying. (The tax indemnity payable is 
described in note 15.)

Contract assets are recognised when the Group has a 
conditional right to consideration from a customer in exchange  
for goods or services transferred. Contract assets are transferred 
to trade receivables when the entitlement to payment becomes 
unconditional and only the passage of time is required before 
payment is due.

15. Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables mainly consist of amounts owed to suppliers 
that have been invoiced or are accrued. They also include social 
security and other amounts due in relation to the Group’s role as  
an employer.

Accounting policy
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value, which is 
usually the amount invoiced. They are subsequently measured  
at amortised cost.

Accrued expenses are recognised for goods and services 
received before the end of the year for which no invoice has 
been received. They are measured at amortised cost. 

Contingent consideration, resulting from business combinations 
sometimes arises when additional consideration to the sellers will 
need to be paid if certain performance targets for the business 
are achieved. Contingent consideration is valued at fair value at 
the acquisition date as part of the business combination. When 
the contingent consideration meets the definition of a financial 
liability, it is subsequently remeasured to fair value through the 
income statement at each reporting date. The fair value gain  
or loss is classified as a non-underlying transaction cost in the 
income statement (see note 2.3). The fair value is calculated 
based on discounted cash flows. The key assumptions in 
calculating the fair value include the probability of meeting  
each performance target and the discount factor.

Trade and other payables include the Tradeweb tax receivable 
agreement liability. In connection with Tradeweb's initial public 
offering (IPO), Tradeweb entered into a tax receivable agreement 
with the owners of Tradeweb Markets LLC (the “LLC Owners”) 
immediately prior to Tradeweb’s IPO. Under the agreement, 
Tradeweb is required to make cash payments to the LLC Owners 
equal to 50% of the amount of any tax savings that Tradeweb 
realises as a result of certain future tax benefits to which it is 
entitled. The Tradeweb tax receivable agreement liability is 
measured at amortised cost.

As described in note 13, the Group has a tax indemnity agreement 
with Thomson Reuters. The Group has a tax indemnity payable 
to Thomson Reuters against a matching tax receivable which is 
recognised within current tax receivable in the balance sheet. 
The tax indemnity payable is measured on the same basis as  
the indemnified tax receivable. When there is a change in the 
indemnified tax receivable, which is recognised within tax  
(as non-underlying) in the income statement, there is an offsetting 
change in the tax indemnity payable. This change is recognised 
within operating expenses in the income statement and classified 
as non-underlying.

16. Borrowings, lease liabilities and net debt

16.1 Borrowings (excluding lease liabilities)

Accounting policy
Borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of amounts 
received, net of capitalised direct issue costs and arrangement 
fees (including upfront facility fees). 

Subsequently, these liabilities are carried at amortised cost. 
Interest payable on borrowings, direct issue costs and 
arrangement fees (including upfront facility fees) are recognised 
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings  
using the effective interest method.

Where borrowings are identified as a hedged item in  
a designated fair value hedge relationship, fair value adjustments 
are recognised in accordance with our policy (see note 17).

The Group’s sources of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes 
include a range of committed bank facilities and long-term and 
short-term issuances in the capital markets including commercial paper 
and bonds. Liabilities arising from the Group’s lease arrangements  
are also reported in borrowings. Net debt comprises cash and cash 
equivalents less lease liabilities and borrowings, adjusted for derivative 
financial instruments.

16. Borrowings, lease liabilities and net debt continued

Committed bank facilities: Multi-currency revolving credit facilities
In November 2023, the Group amended its £1,425 million revolving 
credit facility, increasing the facility amount to £1,925 million and 
extending the maturity to December 2027. The Group retained access 
to its £1,075 million revolving credit facility, which also matures in 
December 2027. No amounts were outstanding on either facility  
as at 31 December 2023.

Committed term loan
US dollar term loan repayments totalling $1,560 million were made 
during the year, with the term loan being fully repaid in October 2023.

Commercial paper
During the year, the Group updated its US Commercial Paper  
(USCP) Programme and Euro Commercial Paper (ECP) Programme, 
increasing the limits to $2.5 billion and £1.5 billion respectively.  
As at 31 December 2023, $937 million (£735 million) was outstanding 
under the USCP Programme, and €353 million (£306 million) and  
£165 million under the ECP Programme (2022: nil). 

Bonds
In September 2023, the Group issued €1.4 billion of bonds under  
its £4 billion Euro Medium Term Note Programme (EMTN). The issue 
consisted of two tranches of €700 million each, maturing in 2026 and 
2030. The Group entered into a series of euro interest rate swaps to 
swap fixed interest obligations to floating interest obligations. The bonds 
and interest rate swaps have been designated as hedged items and 
hedging instruments in a fair value hedging relationship (see note 17.4c). 
The carrying values of the bonds have been adjusted for fair value 

movements attributable to interest rate risk. The Group also entered into 
a series of cross-currency interest rate swaps to swap the euro debt into 
US dollar debt (see note 17.4d).

Other Group facilities
In accordance with the Committee on Payments and Market 
Infrastructures, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions 
and Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, many central  
banks allow CCPs to apply for access to certain central bank facilities.  
In addition, a number of Group entities have access to uncommitted 
operational, money market and overdraft facilities which support  
post trade activities and day-to-day liquidity requirements. These 
facilities were drawn down during the year and fully repaid as at  
31 December 2023.

Fair values
All the Group’s borrowings are recognised at amortised cost on the 
balance sheet, except where the borrowing has been designated  
as a hedged item in a fair value hedge relationship. In some cases, 
amortised cost may differ from their fair value.

Bonds are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy for determining 
and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments (as described in  
the accounting policy of note 17). Bond fair values are as quoted in the 
relevant fixed income markets.

Bank borrowings and commercial paper are classified as Level 2 (see 
definition in note 17). The fair values of these instruments are based on 
cash flows which are discounted using a rate based on borrowing cost.

The fair values of the Group's borrowings, excluding lease liabilities, are as follows:

16.2 Lease liabilities and net investments in leases
The Group leases assets from other parties (the Group is a lessee)  
and also leases assets to other parties (the Group is a lessor). This note 
describes how the Group accounts for leases and provides details 
about its lease arrangements.

Accounting policy
Group as lessee
When the Group leases an asset, at the lease commencement 
date a right-of-use asset is recognised for the leased item  
(see note 10) and a lease liability is recognised for any lease 
payments to be paid over the lease term.

Lease liabilities
Lease liabilities are recognised at the net present value of the 
remaining future payments to be made over the lease term.

The net present value is determined using a discount rate 
equivalent to the incremental borrowing rate of the leasing  
entity unless there is a rate implicit within the lease agreement. 
Subsequently, the value of the discount is recognised over the 
life of the lease on a reducing balance basis as lease interest in 
finance cost.

The Group leases many properties around the world and lease 
terms vary from monthly up to 15 years. Many of these leases 
contain option clauses to extend the lease or break clauses to 
terminate the lease. The lease term recognised is the non-
cancellable period of the lease plus any periods for which the 
Group is reasonably certain of exercising any extension options. 
The Group values its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities 
based on its intentions at the balance sheet date. Any change in 
these intentions is accounted for as a lease modification and the 
assets and liabilities are amended accordingly. Any resulting 
effect on the net assets of the Group would not be significant.

Variable lease payments based on an index are estimated at the 
commencement date and revalued on an annual basis.

Lease payments due within 12 months are classified as current 
liabilities. Payments due after 12 months are classified as 
non-current liabilities.

Short-term leases and leases of low value assets
Rental costs for leased assets that are for less than 12 months  
or are for assets with an individual value of less than £5,000 are 
recognised directly in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the lease.

Group as lessor
Finance leases
Where the Group sub-lets a property right-of-use asset for 
substantially all the useful life of that asset, this is recognised  
as a finance lease. On commencement of a finance sub-lease,  
the property right-of-use asset is treated as disposed of and  
a net investment in lease, equivalent to the net present value  
of the future rent receipts is recognised as a receivable on  
the balance sheet (see note 13). The value of the discount is 
recognised over the life of the sub-lease on a reducing balance 
basis as interest income in finance income.

Where the value of the receipts from the sub-lease is lower than 
the amount payable on the head-lease, we recognise a loss  
on disposal of the right-of-use asset in the income statement.

Operating leases
A right-of-use asset that is sub-let for less than its expected useful 
life is recognised as an operating lease and rental income is 
recognised as received in other income. We continue to 
recognise the property right-of-use asset on the consolidated 
balance sheet.

Movements in lease liabilities were as follows:

The maturity of the Group’s lease commitments is disclosed within  
the risk management note (see note 17.5). The potential future lease 
payments, should the Group exercise extension and termination options, 
would result in an increase in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities  
of up to £245 million.

The weighted average discount rate used by the Group for lease 
liabilities was 2.9% (2022: 2.3%).

A limited number of the Group’s leases are subject to variable lease 
payments linked to publicly available indexes. Adjustments to the value 
of the lease liabilities and associated assets are made annually, but do 
not have a material impact on the Group’s net assets.

17. Financial assets and financial liabilities

The Group has a number of financial assets and financial liabilities. 
Financial assets mainly consist of clearing member assets, trade and 
other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents. Financial liabilities 
are mainly clearing member balances, trade and other payables,  
and borrowings.

This note also details our financial risk management strategy, such as 
how we manage our exposure to capital, credit, country, liquidity and 
market risk.

Accounting policy
Recognition and measurement
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised  
at fair value. The Group classifies its financial instruments at: 
amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI); or fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). The 
classification depends on the Group’s business model for 
managing its financial instruments and whether or not the cash 
flows generated are “solely payments of principal and interest”.

Financial assets
 — Financial assets at amortised cost are financial assets that  

are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest. These include: cash and 
cash equivalents; trade and other receivables; clearing 
member trading balances relating to certain collateralised 
transactions; and other receivables from clearing members  
of the CCP businesses. 

 — Financial assets at FVOCI – debt instruments are assets 
where the objective is achieved by both collecting the 
contractual cash flows and selling the asset. The contractual 
cash flows received are solely payments of principal and 
interest. They include quoted debt instruments (predominantly 
government bonds) held by the CCP businesses, which are 
used under the business model to both collect the contractual 
cash flows and, on occasion, to profit from their sale.  
Interest received from these assets is recognised in the income 
statement as finance income. Where negative interest rates 
apply, the interest is recognised in finance expense. Any 
accumulated profit or loss previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is recycled to the income statement  
on derecognition of the asset.

 — Financial assets at FVOCI – equity instruments are strategic 
equity investments which are held for the long-term but do not 
give the Group control or significant influence. The Group has 
irrevocably elected to classify these investments as FVOCI. 
Dividends received from these investments are recognised in 
the income statement within other income when the right of 
receipt has been established. Accumulated gains or losses on 
equity instruments remain in equity on derecognition and are 
not recycled through the income statement.

 — Financial assets at FVPL include all other financial assets not 
classified as amortised cost or FVOCI. They include CCP 
businesses’ clearing member trading balances comprising 
derivatives, as well as equity and debt instruments that are 
marked to market on a daily basis.

Financial liabilities
 —  Financial liabilities at FVPL include the CCP businesses’ 

clearing member trading balances, comprising derivatives,  
as well as equity and debt instruments that are marked to 
market on a daily basis.

 — Financial liabilities at amortised cost are all financial liabilities 

that are not classified as financial liabilities at FVPL. They 
include trade and other payables, borrowings and other 
payables to clearing members. 

Impairment
The Group adopts a forward-looking approach to estimating 
impairment losses on financial assets. An expected credit loss 
(ECL) arises if the expected cash flows are lower than the 
contractual cash flows due. The difference is discounted at the 
asset’s original effective interest rate and recognised as an 
impairment of the original value of the asset.
 — Financial assets at amortised cost – the ECL for trade 

receivables (including fees receivable), contract assets, and 
lease receivables is derived using the simplified approach  
in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments to calculate a lifetime ECL.  
The allowance is based on historical experience of collection 
rates, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to each 
counterparty and the economic environment at large,  
to create an expected loss matrix.  
The ECL on other financial assets held at amortised cost is 
measured using the general approach. An allowance is 
calculated based on the 12-month ECL at each reporting  
date unless there is a significant increase in the financial 
instrument’s credit risk, in which case a loss allowance based 
on the lifetime ECL is calculated.

 — Financial assets at FVOCI – debt instruments held at FVOCI 

comprise high-quality government bonds that have a low credit 
risk. The Group’s policy is to calculate a 12-month ECL on  
these assets. If there is a significant increase in credit risk,  
then a lifetime ECL will be recognised. A significant increase in 
credit risk is considered to have occurred when contractual 
payments are more than 30 days past due.

 — Financial assets at FVOCI – equity instruments are revalued 

to fair value on a regular basis.

 — Financial assets at FVPL – no ECL is calculated for assets held 

at FVPL as any expected loss is already recognised in the 
recorded fair value of the asset.

17. Financial assets and financial liabilities continued

Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is 
an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following valuation hierarchy for determining 
and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:
 — Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for 

identical assets or liabilities;

 — Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a 
significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, 
either directly or indirectly; and

 — Level 3: techniques which use inputs, which have a significant 

effect on the recorded fair value, that are not based on 
observable market data.

For Level 1, the fair value is based on market price quotations at 
the reporting date. 

For assets and liabilities classified as Level 2, the fair value is 
calculated using one or more valuation techniques (e.g. the 
market approach or the income approach) with market 
observable inputs. The selection of the appropriate valuation 
techniques may be affected by the availability and reliability of  
the relevant inputs. The inputs may include currency rates, 
interest rates, forward rate curves, and net asset values.

When observable market data is not available, the Group uses 
one or more valuation techniques for which sufficient and reliable 
data is available. The inputs used in estimating the fair value of 
Level 3 financial instruments typically include expected timing and 
amount of future cash flows, timing of settlement, discount rates 
and the net asset values of certain investments.

The Group determines whether a transfer between levels has 
occurred by reviewing the categorisation of assets and liabilities 
at the end of each reporting period, based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the valuation.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date  
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at regular intervals. The method  
of recognising any resulting measurement gain or loss depends 
on whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.

The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to manage 
its foreign exchange risk. It enters into a series of exchange 
contracts to purchase or sell certain currencies against sterling 
and US dollars in the future at fixed amounts. The Group has 
embedded foreign currency derivatives, primarily in revenue 
contracts where the currency of the contract is different from the 
functional or local currencies of the parties involved. The Group 
records these derivative instruments at fair value in the balance 
sheet as either assets or liabilities. Changes in fair value are 
recognised in the income statement.

The Group hedges a proportion of its net investment in foreign 
subsidiaries by designating some euro and US dollar borrowings 
and derivative instruments as net investment hedges. Any gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of 
the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and 
remains in the hedging reserve until the underlying asset or 
liability is derecognised.

As part of the Group’s interest rate management policy  
(see note 17.5), the Group enters into derivative instruments to 
convert a portion of its fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. 
These derivative instruments have been designated as fair value 
hedges. The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for  
fair value changes attributable to the risk being hedged, with the 
corresponding entry recorded in the income statement. Changes 
in fair value of the derivative instruments are also recognised in 
the income statement.

In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a transaction must meet 
strict criteria regarding documentation, effectiveness, probability 
of occurrence and reliability of measurement. We document the 
relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at 
the inception of the transaction, as well as documenting the risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various 
hedging transactions. The effectiveness of the hedge is tested at 
each reporting date and at the commencement and conclusion  
of any hedge in order to verify that it continues to satisfy all  
the criteria for hedge accounting. Any ineffective portion is 
recognised in the income statement as finance income  
or expense.

Amounts that have accumulated through other comprehensive 
income in the hedging reserve are recognised in the income 
statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or 
loss (for example, when the forecast transaction that is hedged 
takes place). When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or 
when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
any cumulative gain or loss remains in the hedging reserve:  
it is only recognised in the income statement when the  
forecast transaction itself is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected  
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported through 
other comprehensive income is immediately recognised in the 
income statement.

The profit or loss on a derivative which is not designated  
as a hedging instrument is recognised directly in the  
income statement.

1  At 31 December 2023, there are no provisions for expected credit losses in relation to any of the CCP businesses’ financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI (2022: nil). The Group closely 
monitors its CCP investment portfolio and invests only in government debt and other collateralised instruments where the risk of loss is minimal. There was no increase in credit risk in the year 
and none of the assets are past due (2022: nil).

2  Clearing member cash and cash equivalents represents amounts received from the clearing members to cover initial and variation margins, and default fund contributions that are not invested in 
bonds. These amounts are deposited with banks, including central banks, or invested securely in short-term reverse repurchase contracts (reverse repos). Other financial assets represent the 
CCP investment in government bonds.

17.3 Fair values
Other than borrowings, we have assessed that the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities categorised as being at amortised cost 
approximate to their carrying values. The fair values of the Group’s borrowings are disclosed in note 16.1.

Fair value measurement hierarchy
The Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value consist largely of securities which are restricted in use for the operations of the 
Group’s CCPs as managers of their respective clearing and guarantee systems.

The following tables provide the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value.

17.4 Hedging activities and derivatives
The Group hedges its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate 
movements using derivative instruments. The Group applies hedge 
accounting where appropriate, and has designated some derivatives  
as net investment hedges, fair value hedges and cash flow hedges.  
The Group also has some derivatives which do not qualify for hedge 
accounting or have not been designated as hedges.

17.4a Net investment hedges
The Group uses net investment hedges to hedge the currency risk 
arising from its investment in foreign operations. The Group has 
designated some of its euro borrowings and cross-currency interest rate 
swaps, used to swap a portion of its euro borrowings into US dollar 
debt, as net investment hedges. 

There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and  
the hedging instruments (the borrowings) as the euro and US dollar 
borrowings are matched by the Group’s investments in euro and US 
dollar assets. The Group has established a ratio of 1:1 for the hedging 
relationships as the underlying foreign exchange risk of the borrowings 
is identical to the investments. To ensure the hedge is effective, the 
Group makes sure that the borrowings are always less than the value  
of the investments. Hedge ineffectiveness only arises if the value of the 
hedging instrument exceeds the value of the underlying net investment. 
The hedging instruments are detailed below.

Cross-currency interest rate swaps
In 2017, the Group entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps in 
order to more closely match the Group’s currency of borrowing to the 
currency of its net assets and earnings.

As disclosed in note 16.1, two €500 million bonds (maturing in 2024 and 
2029) were issued in 2017. €700 million of these bonds were swapped 
into $836 million through a series of cross-currency interest rate swaps 
which mature on the same dates as the bonds. These instruments 
effectively exchange some of the obligations and coupons of the  
bonds from euros into US dollars. These swaps have been designated  
as a hedge of the Group’s net investments in its US dollar reporting 
subsidiaries and qualify for hedge accounting. 

Non-derivative hedges
Non-derivative hedges relate to euro borrowings which are matched 
against the Group’s investments in euro denominated subsidiaries.

The remaining €300 million of the two €500 million bonds issued in 
2017 which were not swapped into US dollars, together with the  
€500 million bond issued in 2018 (see note 16.1), qualify as hedging 
instruments against euro denominated subsidiaries and qualify for 
hedge accounting. The €700 million that has been swapped is included 
below and is netted against the fair value movement of the US dollar 
derivative in the hedging reserve.

facilities, but these drawings were not designated as net investment 
hedges. As at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, there were 
no amounts outstanding on these facilities.

During the year, the Group issued euro and US dollar commercial paper, 
but these issuances were not designated as net investment hedges. 
There were no issuances of commercial paper during 2022. As at  
31 December 2023, $937 million (£735 million) and €353 million  
(£306 million) were outstanding (31 December 2022: £nil).

17.4b Cash flow hedges
The Group uses cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate risk on 
cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions.

Interest rate swaps
In 2021, the Group entered into a series of US dollar interest rate  
swaps with tenures of 3, 5 and 10 years, with aggregate principal 
amounts of $500 million, $1,000 million and $1,250 million respectively. 
The interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges with  
the hedged item being planned bond issuances that were deemed 
highly probable at the time and related to the Refinitiv acquisition.  
The interest rate swaps were settled in March and April 2021 when  
the new bonds were issued (see note 16.1). At the date of settlement,  
a gain of $31 million (£22 million) was recognised in the hedging  
reserve, representing the effective portion of the gain on the hedging 
instrument. This will be recycled to the income statement over the term 
of the debt. During the year £3 million (2022: £3 million) was recycled  
to the income statement.

17.4c Fair value hedges
The Group uses fair value hedges to hedge the risk of changes  
in the fair value of its fixed rate borrowings resulting from interest  
rate movements.

Interest rate swaps
In September 2023, the Group issued two €700 million fixed rate 
bonds, maturing in 2026 and 2030, as disclosed in note 16.1. On the 
same day, the Group entered into a series of euro interest rate swaps 
with tenures of 3 and 7 years, each with aggregate notional amounts of 
€700 million. As a result of the swaps, the Group receives a fixed rate of 
interest and pays floating rate interest based on the Euro Short-Term 
Rate (ESTR) plus a spread. Interest has been swapped from fixed to 
floating as part of the Group’s interest rate management policy  
(see note 17.5).

The bonds and interest rate swaps have been designated as the 
hedged items and hedging instruments in a fair value hedging 
relationship. The interest rate swaps are used to hedge the exposure  
to changes in the fair value of the bonds. There is an economic 
relationship between the hedged items and hedging instruments as  
the terms of the fixed leg of the interest rate swaps match the terms  
of the bonds, such as notional amounts, interest rates and maturity 
dates. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging 
relationships as the underlying interest rate risk of the derivatives is 
identical to the hedged risk component.

To assess hedge effectiveness, the Group uses regression analysis  
for its retrospective hedge effectiveness testing to ensure the hedge 
remained highly effective. The Group uses the critical terms match 
approach for its prospective hedge effectiveness testing to ensure  
the hedge is expected to remain highly effective. Sources of hedge 
ineffectiveness include counterparty credit risk, which impacts fair value 
movements of the hedging instruments but not the hedged items.

17.4d Derivatives not designated as hedges
Cross-currency interest rate swaps
As part of the bond issuance and in addition to the interest rate swaps 
entered into in September 2023, as noted in 17.4c, the Group entered 
into a series of cross-currency interest rate swaps to swap the two  
€700 million bonds to $740 million, with a tenure of three years,  
and $742 million, with a tenure of seven years. These instruments 
effectively exchange the obligations and coupons of the bonds and 
interest rate swaps from euros to US dollars, in accordance with the 
Group’s foreign exchange risk management policy (see note 17.5).  
As a result of the swaps, the Group receives euro floating rate interest 
based on ESTR plus a spread and pays US dollar floating rate interest 
based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a spread. 

The cross-currency interest rate swaps have not been designated as 
hedges. This is because a portion of their fair value movements offset 
with income statement movements arising on other financial assets  
and liabilities, resulting in a natural hedge. 

Foreign currency forwards
The Group uses foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign 
exchange risk. It enters into a series of exchange contracts to purchase 
or sell certain currencies against sterling and US dollars in the future at 
fixed amounts. The cumulative sterling notional amounts of contracts 
outstanding as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 were

17.5 Financial risk management
The Group seeks to protect its financial performance and the value of its business from various risks including exposure to capital, credit, 
concentration, country, liquidity, settlement, custodial and market risks. Details of these risks, which should be read in conjunction with the Principal 
Risks and Uncertainties on pages 79 to 88, are provided below.

Capital risk

Risk description

Capital risk relates to the Group’s ability to  
meet regulatory capital requirements and 
minimum internal investment returns.

There is a risk that the Group’s entities may  
not maintain, or have access to, sufficient 
high-quality capital to meet their regulatory,  
or other obligations. This could result in a loss  
of regulatory approvals and/or the imposition  
of financial sanctions.

The main capital risks faced by the Group are:

 — An increased regulatory capital requirement 

of its regulated companies

 — Negative yields on its investments

 — An inability to raise debt or equity  

financing as a result of its own poor financial 
performance, or poor financing conditions

Risk management approach

The Group, which consists of both regulated and unregulated entities, is profitable and strongly cash 
generative. It can manage its capital structure (which consists of equity and debt capital) and react to 
changes in economic conditions by varying returns to shareholders, issuing new shares or increasing or 
reducing borrowings. The Board reviews dividend policy and funding capacity on a regular basis and the 
Group maintains comfortable levels of debt facility headroom. A high-level summary of the Group’s capital 
structure is presented below:

The Group maintains a Capital Management Policy, the execution of which is overseen by the Group’s 
Financial, Investment and Capital Committee. The Group seeks to allocate capital in order to maintain a 
strong balance sheet, meet regulatory requirements, drive growth and offer suitable returns to shareholders. 
Regulated entities within the Group monitor compliance with policy and the capital requirements set by their 
respective regulatory authorities. 

Regulatory and operational capital represents:

 — Amounts held as cash and cash equivalents and investments in financial assets by regulated entities to 

satisfy their local regulatory capital requirements

 — Letters of credit issued by the Group to customers and suppliers

The Group’s total regulatory and operational capital is shown below:

To ensure ongoing financial strength, access to new capital at a reasonable cost, and to sustain an 
investment grade credit rating, the Group monitors its leverage ratio against a target range of 1.5-2.5 times 
(moving from a target range of 1.0-2.0 times during 2023). Leverage is calculated as operating net debt  
(i.e. net debt after excluding lease liabilities and amounts set aside for regulatory and operational purposes) 
to adjusted EBITDA before foreign exchange gains or losses (Group adjusted earnings from continuing 
operations before net finance costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment and before foreign 
exchange gains or losses). At 31 December 2023, leverage was 1.8 times (2022: 1.8 times).

While the Group’s bank borrowing facilities do not include financial covenants, the Group takes into account 
certain financial metrics (including liquidity headroom and the leverage ratio) when considering whether to 
increase the size of its borrowings and net debt. The Group seeks to maintain a strong investment grade 
credit rating and will always seek to return leverage to its target range if it rises temporarily.

Credit and concentration risk

Risk description

Risk management approach

Credit risk relates to the potential for  
a Group counterparty (including CCP 
members, and any counterparty where 
there is exposure through payment, clearing 
or settlement processes) to be unable to 
meet its financial obligations to the Group 
when due.

Credit concentration risk may arise through 
Group entities having large individual  
or connected exposures to groups of 
counterparties whose likelihood of default  
is driven by common underlying factors.

Group
Credit risk is governed by policies set by the Group Risk function. Limits and thresholds for credit and 
concentration risk are reviewed regularly.

Group companies make judgements on the credit quality of their clients. This is based on the client’s financial 
position, the recurring nature of billing and collection arrangements and historical evidence relating to the 
client’s ability to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due. The Group is exposed to a large number of 
clients and so we deem concentration risk on the Group’s receivables to be low.

The Group’s main credit risk exposure arises on the financial assets shown earlier in note 17.1. There have 
been no significant increases in credit risk for these assets and no estimated credit losses have been 
recognised on other financial instruments.

Non-CCP entities
The principal source of non-CCP credit risk is the creditworthiness of the investment counterparties with 
which the Group deposits cash. The Group manages its credit risk by outlining the maximum financial 
exposure that may be taken against any one counterparty, based on an assessment of the counterparty’s 
credit quality.

Cash and cash equivalents are held with authorised counterparties of a high credit standing. Cash is held in 
unsecured interest-bearing current and call accounts. Cash equivalents comprise short-term deposits and 
AAA-rated money market funds.

Derivative transactions (and other treasury receivable structures) must be in line with the Group’s policy 
framework and may only be undertaken with highly rated counterparties.

CCPs
The principal source of CCP credit risk lies in the potential for one or more clearing members to default. 
Group CCPs manage this risk through robust financial risk management. Clearing members are selected 
based on an assessment of their supervisory capital as well as their technical and organisational strength. 
Each member must pay margins to the relevant Group CCP. The margins are in the form of cash and highly 
liquid securities. Clearing members also contribute to default funds managed by the Group CCPs. These  
aim to protect the integrity of the markets in the event of multiple defaults in extreme market circumstances. 
Group CCPs use stress tests to determine the appropriate margin and default fund requirements. These are 
reviewed by CCP risk committees who can take action as appropriate.

CCPs are required by regulation to hold a minimum amount of capital (regulatory capital). Each of the Group’s 
CCPs maintains this regulatory capital requirement, together with an additional holding of its own capital. This 
additional capital is to help manage credit risk during a significant market stress event or member default.

The total clearing member contributions of margin and default funds across the Group CCPs is shown below:

Group CCPs manage the credit risk associated with margin and default fund contributions by investing  
the cash element in instruments or structures deemed “secure” by the relevant regulatory bodies. This 
includes: direct investments in highly rated, “regulatory qualifying” sovereign bonds and supra-national  
debt; investments in tri-party and bilateral reverse repos (receiving high-quality government securities as 
collateral); and, in certain jurisdictions, deposits with the central bank. The small proportion of cash that is 
invested unsecured is placed for short durations with highly rated counterparties where limits are applied 
with respect to credit quality, concentration and tenor.

Risk description

Risk management approach

Associated liquidity risks are considered in the investment mix and discussed further below in the Liquidity, 
Settlement and Custodial risk section.

To address concentration risk, the Group maintains a diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid investments 
and uses a broad range of custodians, payment and settlement banks and agents. The largest concentration 
of treasury exposures as at 31 December 2023 was with the French Government with an aggregate 
exposure of 43% of the total investment portfolio (2022: 40% with the French Government).

Trade receivables (including fees receivable)
An impairment analysis of trade and fees receivable is performed monthly using a provision matrix to 
measure expected credit losses based on factors such as the counterparty’s historic payment practices, 
expected future payments and the economic environment at large. The calculation reflects current conditions 
together with forecasts of future economic conditions. None of the Group’s trade receivables are material by 
individual counterparty.

Risk management approach

The Group maintains a country risk framework to help assess and monitor the risk of doing business with,  
or operating in, a country.

Group CCPs have specific risk management frameworks that address country risk for both clearing and 
margin operations. Contained in these frameworks are a suite of stress scenarios that consider deterioration 
of sovereign credit quality as well as other risk factors. These scenarios support CCPs in developing and 
maintaining the appropriate country risk measurement, monitoring and mitigation tools. Risk Committees 
oversee these risks and the associated policy frameworks to protect the Group against a potentially adverse 
impact arising from volatility in the sovereign debt markets.

The Group CCPs’ sovereign exposures at the end of the financial reporting periods were:

Country risk

Risk description

Country risk relates to those risks that are 
inherent when doing business with, or 
operating in, a country.

Some governments may be unable or find it 
difficult to service their debts. This could have 
adverse effects, particularly on the Group’s 
CCPs, potentially impacting cleared products, 
margin collateral, investments, the clearing 
membership and the financial industry  
as a whole.

In addition, geopolitical events could impact 
our ability to operate in a country or impact the 
value of our assets in that country. We may 
even need to relocate activities or change  
our operating model in response.

Liquidity, settlement and custodial risk 

Risk description

Risk management approach

The Group’s liquidity risk relates to its ability  
to meet its short- and long-term payment 
obligations as they fall due.

Additionally, the Group’s CCPs, and certain 
other Group entities, must maintain a level  
of liquidity (consistent with regulatory 
requirements) to make sure their services 
operate smoothly and to be able to  
continue to operate in the event of  
a significant stress event.

The Group’s settlement and custodial  
risks relate to the potential for a partner  
firm to default on its obligations in respect  
of custody, settlement, payment or other 
administration activities, or that no action  
is taken by the Group to mitigate these  
risks. This also includes the risk that  
client assets are immobilised as a result  
of a third-party bankruptcy.

Group
The Group is profitable, has strong free cash flow and generates annuity-like revenue which is not 
significantly impacted by seasonal variations. The Group maintains sufficient liquid resources to meet its 
financial obligations as they fall due, and to invest in capital expenditure, pay dividends, meet its pension 
commitments and support or fund acquisitions or repay borrowings. Subject to regulatory constraints 
impacting certain entities, funds can (generally) be lent across the Group and cash earnings can be remitted 
through regular dividend payments by subsidiary companies. This is an important component of the Group 
Treasury cash management policy and approach. 

Management monitors the Group’s cash flow forecasts and overlays sensitivities to these forecasts to reflect 
assumptions about more challenging market conditions or stress events. The Group will take the appropriate 
actions to satisfy working capital requirements when committing to large scale acquisitions, including making 
sure there is comfortable liquidity headroom projected over a reasonable time frame.

Non-CCP entities
The Group Treasury Policy requires the Group to maintain adequate credit facilities provided by a diversified 
lending group to cover its expected funding requirements and ensure a minimum level of headroom for at 
least the next 24 months. The financial strength of the Group’s lenders is monitored regularly.

For full details of the Group’s borrowings and facilities, see note 16.1.

CCPs
In order to meet the cash requirements of the clearing and settlement cycle, the Group’s CCPs maintain 
sufficient cash and cash equivalents and, in certain jurisdictions, have access to central bank refinancing or 
commercial bank credit lines. Regulations require CCPs to ensure that appropriate levels of back-up liquidity 
are in place to underpin the dynamics of a largely secured cash investment requirement, ensuring that the 
maximum potential outflow under extreme market conditions is covered (see credit and concentration risk 
section above).

In the event of a member default, Group CCPs can liquidate the defaulting member’s portfolio to cover both 
losses associated with the default and settlement of any other financial obligations of the defaulting member.

In addition, certain Group companies, including the CCPs, maintain commercial bank facilities which support 
management of intraday and overnight liquidity. 

Custodians are subject to minimum eligibility requirements, ongoing credit assessments and robust 
contractual arrangements. They are also required to have appropriate contingency arrangements in place.

Financial liability maturity
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the 
remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in  
the table reflect the contractual undiscounted cash flows. The borrowings and lease liabilities include future 
interest that has not been accrued at the balance sheet date.

Market risk – foreign exchange risk

Risk description

Risk management approach

The Group operates globally with primary 
centres in the UK, Europe and North America.  
It also has growing and strategically important 
businesses in Asia. The Group’s principal 
currencies of operation are sterling, US dollars, 
and the euro.

The Group is exposed to transactional foreign 
exchange risk and translational risk. 
Transactional risk arises when we buy or sell 
goods or services in a currency other than  
our entities’ functional currencies. We may  
be exposed to movements in that currency. 
Translational risk arises from the translation  
of account balances recorded in an entity’s 
functional currency into the Group's reporting 
currency for the purpose of statutory reporting.

Transactional foreign exchange risk may 
present itself in payment of intragroup 
dividends or when interest obligations, which 
are in a different currency, are due. However, 
both of these operations play their part in 
controlling the level of translational foreign 
exchange exposure the Group faces.

Transactional foreign exchange risk may also 
arise when investing in, or divesting from, 
operations denominated in currencies  
other than sterling.

In addition, the Group has some contracts/ 
cash flow profiles with a foreign exchange 
component that could trigger embedded 
derivative recognition and, as such,  
fair value accounting treatment.

Translational risk
The Group manages its translational risk, where possible, by matching the currency of its debt to the 
currency of its earnings, to make sure certain key financial metrics are protected from material foreign 
exchange rate volatility. The Group also seeks to balance the currency of its assets with its liabilities. In order 
to mitigate the impact of unfavourable currency exchange rate movements on earnings and net assets, 
non-sterling cash earnings are centralised and applied to debt and interest payments in the same currency. 
Where required, currency of debt is re-balanced using cross-currency swaps to better match the currency  
of debt to the overall currency of earnings.

A material proportion of the Group's debt is held in or swapped into euros and US dollars as noted below:

Currency of debt

Euro denominated drawn debt

Euro denominated cross-currency interest rate swaps

US dollar denominated drawn debt

US dollar denominated cross-currency interest rate swaps

4,263

1,818

2022 
£m

2,652

(695)

5,014

695

The cross-currency interest rate swaps are directly linked to euro fixed debt. A proportion of the euro and 
US dollar denominated debt, including the cross-currency swaps, provide a hedge against the Group’s net 
investment in euro and US dollar denominated entities. 

At 31 December 2023, the Group’s designated hedges of its net investments were effective.

Transactional risk
While transactional foreign exchange exposure is limited, the Group mitigates this by either hedging material 
transactions with appropriate derivative instruments or by settling currency payables or receivables within  
a short timeframe. The Group Treasury Policy requires cash flows of single transactions or a series of linked 
transactions of more than £2 million or equivalent per annum to be hedged. The risk is also minimised  
by the periodic exchange of cash into each Group entity’s functional currency. Where appropriate, hedge 
accounting for derivatives is considered in order to mitigate material levels of income statement volatility.

Governance and sensitivity
The Group’s Risk Committee reviewed the approach to foreign exchange risk management during the 
quarter ended 31 December 2023.

In addition to projecting and analysing its earnings and debt profile by currency, the Group reviews 
sensitivities to movements in exchange rates. The Group has considered movements in the euro and the  
US dollar over 2023 and 2022 and, based on actual market observations between its principal currency 
pairs, has concluded that a 10% movement in rates is a reasonable level to illustrate the risk to the Group. 
The impact on profit after tax and equity is set out in the table below:

The sensitivity of profit after tax reflects foreign exchange gains or losses on translation of financial assets 
and financial liabilities, including cash and borrowings but excluding hedged balances.

The sensitivity of equity reflects the foreign exchange gains or losses on translation of euro and US dollar 
borrowings that have been designated as hedges of a net investment in foreign operations.

Market risk – interest rate risk

Risk description

Risk management approach

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from the 
impact of changes in interest rates on cash 
held and investments in financial assets,  
and on borrowings held at floating rates.

The Group may also face future interest rate 
exposure connected to M&A transactions 
where significant debt financing is involved.

The Group’s CCPs have member liabilities, and 
separately achieve returns which support the 
payment of these liabilities. A CCP’s interest 
rate risk can increase if the reference rates 
used to calculate liabilities increase while the 
reference rates that underpin investment 
returns decrease (or do not increase by  
the same amount).

Group companies that offer guaranteed 
settlement of traded securities can also  
be exposed to latent interest rate risk  
(and market risk more generally) in the  
event of a counterparty default.

The Group’s interest rate management policy focuses on protecting the Group’s credit rating and limiting the 
impact of interest rate increases on Group earnings. To support this objective, the Group targets a maximum 
debt floating rate component of 50%. This approach reflects the broad natural hedge of floating rate 
borrowings provided by the significant balances of cash and cash equivalents held effectively at floating 
rates of interest.

At 31 December 2023 the floating rate component of total debt was 26% (2022: 16%).

Where the Group has committed to M&A transactions and is exposed to prospective interest rate risk on 
borrowings, the Group Treasury function will assess the exposure and consider hedging solutions that 
conform with policy and seek to limit future interest costs. 

In the Group’s CCPs, interest-bearing assets are generally invested in secured instruments or structures. 
These tend to be for a longer term than interest-bearing liabilities, whose interest rate is reset daily. This 
makes investment returns vulnerable to volatility in overnight rates and shifts in spreads between overnight 
and term rates. Interest rate exposures (and the risk to CCP capital) are managed within defined risk appetite 
parameters against which sensitivities are monitored daily.

In our review of the sensitivities to potential movements in interest rates, we have considered interest rate 
volatility over the last year and prospects for rates over the next 12 months. We have concluded that a  
1 percentage point downward movement (with a limited prospect of material upward movement) reflects  
a reasonable level of risk to current rates. If interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings had 
been 1 percentage point lower, with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for 2023 would have 
been £9 million lower (2022: £8 million higher, based on interest rates being 1 percentage point higher) 
mainly as a result of lower interest income on floating rate cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by 
lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.

At the CCP level (in aggregate), if interest rates on the common interest-bearing member liability benchmarks 
of EONIA, Fed Funds and SONIA, (for euro, US dollar and sterling liabilities respectively), had been  
1 percentage point lower, with all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit after tax would have  
been £1 million higher (2022: £1 million lower, based on interest rates being 1 percentage point higher).

17.6 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities

Accounting policy
The Group reports financial assets and financial liabilities  
on a net basis on the balance sheet where there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there  
is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously.

The Group applies the rules of legal right of set off and intent to  
net settle within its clearing member balances. The carrying values  
of the balances are offset at an appropriate level to arrive at the  
net balances reported in the balance sheet. The approach adopted 
is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it remains the most 
appropriate. Any change in approach would not materially affect  
the net assets of the Group.

The following tables show the impact of netting arrangements on all financial assets and financial liabilities that are reported net on the balance 
sheet and where balances have not been netted but there is a right to offset in the event of default:

1  The Group’s CCP companies act as principal and sit in the middle of members’ transactions and hold default funds and margin amounts as a contingency against the default of a member. As such, 
further amounts are available to offset in the event of a default reducing the asset and liability to nil. The Group is subject to master netting arrangements in force with financial counterparties with 
whom the Group trades derivatives. The master netting arrangements determine the proceedings should either party default on their obligations. In the event of default, the non-defaulting party 
will calculate the sum of the replacement cost of outstanding transactions and amounts to be settled.

2  Offset amounts are clearing member trading assets and trading liabilities within the Group’s CCP businesses’ financial instruments.
3  The imbalance between assets and liability for gross and offset amounts is caused by the exclusion of settled to market (“STM”) amounts from the gross balance on the ground that these trades 

are settled.

4  Balance includes accrued interest, which has been recorded in Trade and Other Receivables and Trade and Other Payables and excludes embedded derivatives.

18. Share capital, share premium and other reserves

This note details our share capital, share premium and other reserves. During the year, a number of shares were repurchased under our share 
buyback programmes.

Accounting policy
The share capital of the Company is the number of shares in issue  
at their par value. It consists of balances relating to the Company’s 
ordinary equity shares, own shares held by the Employee Benefit 
Trust (EBT) and any treasury shares held by the Company.

Shares acquired by the Company from the open market as part of 
share buyback programmes are referred to as treasury shares and 
are held by the Company. The consideration payable is deducted 
from retained earnings. The par value of purchased treasury shares 
is recorded as a transfer from the Company’s ordinary equity shares 
to treasury shares within share capital. No gain or loss is recognised 
by the Company in the income statement on the purchase, sale, 
issue or cancellation of the Company’s treasury shares or of own 
shares held by the EBT.

When the Company issues new shares to the EBT at par, the share 
capital of the Company is increased by the par value of these own 
shares, and a corresponding deduction or debit is recorded in the 
share-based payment reserve.

The Company may also issue new shares to the EBT to satisfy 
vesting of specific employee share schemes. These shares may be 
issued at a subscription price above par value, reflecting the option 
cost payable by the participant in the employee share scheme. In 
such instances, the share capital of the Company is increased by  
the par value of these own shares and the difference between the 
subscription price and the par value is recorded in share premium.  
A corresponding deduction or debit is recognised in the share-based 
payment reserve.

1  Ordinary share capital consists of 548,841,716 ordinary shares of 679/86 pence. At 31 December 2023, the Group held 7,632,733 (2022: 3,797,344) treasury shares which were acquired as part of its 

share buyback programme.

2  Share premium is the amount subscribed for share capital in excess of par value.
3  The Board approved the allotment and issue of 98,158 ordinary shares at par to the EBT (2022: 883,174 ordinary shares at par) and the transfer of 1,904,252 treasury shares (2022: nil) to settle 

employee share plans.

In September 2023, the Group completed the off-market  
purchase of limited voting ordinary shares from York Holdings II  
Limited and York Holdings III Limited. The Shares repurchased  
were cancelled immediately. The deduction from retained earnings  
of £754 million reflects:
 — the £750 million to repurchase 9.5 million limited voting ordinary 

shares; and

 — total costs directly attributable to this repurchase of £4 million.

Share buyback
In 2023, the company repurchased 15.2 million (2022: 3.8 million) of  
its own shares. As shown in the consolidated statement of changes  
in equity, retained earnings have therefore reduced by £1,007 million 
(2022: £503 million).

During 2023, as part of its 12-month £750 million share buyback 
programme launched in 2022, the Company repurchased  
5.7 million of its own shares for £450 million (2022: £300 million)  
of which £200 million had been irrevocably committed to as at  
31 December 2022. The deduction from retained earnings of  
£253 million (2022: £503 million) reflects:
 — the £250 million (2022: £300 million) to repurchase 3 million of its 

own shares from the market;

 — an irrevocable commitment of £nil (2022: £200 million) to purchase 

shares during the close period; and

 — total costs directly attributable to this share buyback programme of  

£3 million (2022: £3 million).

1  The merger relief reserve is a potentially distributable reserve arising as a result of shares issued to acquire subsidiaries. 
2  The capital redemption reserve was set up as a result of a court approved capital reduction scheme and is non-distributable.
3  The reverse acquisition reserve arose as a result of the acquisition of London Stock Exchange plc in 2007. It is recognised on consolidation as a result of a capital reduction scheme and is 

non-distributable.

4  The hedging reserve represents the cumulative fair value adjustments recognised in respect of net investment and cash flow hedges entered into in accordance with hedge accounting 

principles. It is distributable under certain circumstances. Net gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and balances remain in equity until both the hedging instrument 
and the underlying instrument are derecognised. Gains realised on cash flow hedges during the year are amortised through the income statement over the life of the underlying instrument. 
During the year, £3 million (2022: £3 million) was recycled back through the income statement.

5  The foreign exchange translation reserve records the cumulative impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the translation of non-sterling subsidiary companies into sterling. It is distributable 

under certain circumstances. Net gains and losses on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income and amounts remain in equity until the subsidiary is derecognised.

19. Non-controlling interests

A non-controlling interest arises when the Group does not own all  
of a subsidiary, but the Group retains control.

Financial information for subsidiary entities or groups that have material 
non-controlling interests is provided below:

Accounting policy
Non-controlling interests
The Group recognises non-controlling interests in a business 
either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's 
proportionate share of the net assets. This treatment is 
determined on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. After initial 
recognition, the carrying value of the non-controlling interest is 
adjusted for any changes in equity and the total comprehensive 
income attributable to the non-controlling interest holders,  
less dividends paid.

Change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary company, 
without loss of control
For acquisitions or disposals of non-controlling interests where 
control of the subsidiary remains with the Group, the difference 
between any consideration paid or received, and the relevant 
share of net assets acquired or sold, is recognised in equity.

20. Share-based payments

We operate various employee share-based compensation plans  
which allow employees to receive or acquire shares in the Company  
in different ways. This note describes our main share plans.

20.1 Group share plans
The Group has the following share plans:
 — Save As You Earn and International Sharesave Plan 2018 (SAYE)  

The SAYE schemes provide for grants of options over the Company’s 
shares to employees who enter into a savings contract. The options 
are granted at 20% below the market price on the date of grant and 
vest after three years, subject to continuing employment. The holders 
of the share options are not entitled to receive dividends declared 
during the vesting period.

 — Long-Term Incentive Plan 2014 (LTIP)  

Awards are granted at nil cost to employees. Vesting of LTIP awards is 
dependent on both market and non-market performance conditions. 
The performance conditions include achievement of relative TSR 
(40%) and adjusted EPS (60%) targets. The holders of LTIP awards are 
not entitled to receive dividends declared during the vesting period.

 — Restricted Share Award Plan 2018 (RSAP)  

The Group operates a restricted share plan, the RSAP. It consists of 
an award of restricted stock units and matching shares. Matching 
shares are linked to an investment by the employee in the Company’s 
shares. Awards are granted at nil cost to employees and generally 
vest in tranches after one, two and three years, subject to continuing 
employment. The holders of RSAP awards are not entitled to receive 
dividends declared during the vesting period. 

 — Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)  

DBP awards are granted at nil cost to employees. Awards usually vest 
after two or three years, subject to continuing employment and malus 
and clawback provisions. The holders of the DBP awards are entitled 
to receive a cash amount equal to the aggregate amount of the 
dividends declared during the vesting period.

 — International Share Incentive Plan (ISIP)  

The ISIP is a scheme in which employees can buy shares in the 
Company monthly via salary deduction. For every four shares 
purchased (purchased shares) by the employee, the Group awards 
them one additional share (accumulated shares) which vests after 
completion of a three-year plan cycle. Accumulated shares are not 
entitled to receive dividends declared during the vesting period.

Further details on the Group’s share plans are provided in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 117 to 153.

The Company has an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) to administer the 
share plans and to acquire Company shares to meet the commitments 
to Group employees. At 31 December 2023, 1,178,957 Company shares 
were held by the trust (2022: 259,129). The EBT is fully funded by the 
Company via loans, cash gifts and the issue and transfer of shares.  
The cost of the Group’s shares held by the EBT are recognised directly 
in equity.

Accounting policy
The Group issues equity-settled share-based awards to certain 
employees. The share-based payment expense recognised in  
the income statement is determined by the fair value (using  
a stochastic valuation model) of the options granted or shares 
awarded at the date of grant. The calculated expenses are 
recognised over the relevant vesting periods.

The fair value of the awards granted:
 — includes any market performance conditions (for example,  

Total Shareholder Return (TSR)); and 

 — excludes the impact of any service and non-market 

performance vesting conditions (for example, the need  
to remain an employee for a specified period of time).

In the very few countries where the Group cannot issue  
equity-settled awards due to local restrictions, cash-settled 
share-based awards are issued instead.

The charges arising from equity-settled share-based payment plans are 
as follows:

Incentive Plan (MIP) participants

non-controlling interests)

A Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the fair value of the 40% 
of the LTIP awards granted during the year that are subject to a relative 
TSR condition. The model simulates the TSR and compares it against 
the constituents of the UK FTSE 100.

1  At 31 December 2023, RSAP awards of 1,237,425 shares were outstanding (2022: 1,078,328).
2  The LTIP/RSAP and ISIP awards have a nil exercise price. 9,192 matching shares were granted 

under the RSAP in the year (2022: 106,637).

The Black-Scholes model was used to determine the related fair value 
for the RSAP, SAYE and remaining 60% of LTIP awards that are subject 
to adjusted EPS.

The weighted average share price of London Stock Exchange Group plc 
shares during the year was £81.66 (2022: £76.11).

The inputs into both models include the share price at grant date, 
expected volatility, dividend yields, annual risk-free interest rate and 
expected life of the awards. The volatility assumption is based on the 
historical three-year volatility of the Company’s share price as at the 
date of grant. The risk-free interest rate represents the yield available  
on a UK zero-coupon government bond on the date of grant for a term 
commensurate with the vesting period of the award. The expected life 
refers to the time from the date of grant to the date the awards vest.

20. Share-based payments continued

20.2 Management Incentive Plan (MIP)
Members of Refinitiv’s senior management team participated in the MIP set 
up by Refinitiv Holding Limited (now York Parent Limited). At the time of  
the Refinitiv acquisition, 6,041,336 shares relating to MIP participants were 
transferred to York Parent Limited as a part of the purchase consideration. 
To improve the retention of the participants, amendments were made to the 
MIP to include additional service vesting conditions. The Group recognises 
the MIP as a share-based payment settled by an external shareholder 
under IFRS 2 and recognises post combination compensation until the  
end of the three-year vesting period. The MIP share-based payment 
expense is classified as a non-underlying transaction cost.

20.3 Tradeweb share schemes
Tradeweb grants awards, including performance-based restricted share 
units (PRSUs), performance share units (PSUs) stock options, restricted 
stock units (RSUs) and dividend equivalent rights. The awards may have 
performance-based and time-based vesting conditions. Stock options 
have a maximum contractual term of 10 years.
 — PRSUs (Equity-Settled) 

PRSUs are promises to issue shares at the end of a three-year vesting 
period. The number of shares a participant will receive upon vesting 
is determined by a performance modifier, which is adjusted based on 
Tradeweb’s financial performance in the grant year. The fair value of 

21. Business combinations

During the year, the Group acquired the material businesses listed 
below. The results of the businesses have been consolidated since the 
date of acquisition:
 — AcadiaSoft, Inc. (Acadia)
 — Yieldbroker Pty Limited (Yieldbroker)

Accounting policy
Business combinations are accounted for using the  
acquisition method:
 — The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred and any contingent consideration, 
which are measured at fair value, and the value of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree.

 — On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group elects 
whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, if any, at fair value or at the proportionate share  
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets (see note 19).
 — Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired are measured at fair value at acquisition date.
 — Goodwill is initially measured at the amount by which the 

aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for non-controlling interests (plus any previous 
interest held), exceeds the net identifiable assets acquired  
and liabilities assumed.

We evaluate the nature of any compensation for the selling 
shareholders' continuing employment to determine if any 
contingent payments are for post-combination employee 
services. These are excluded from consideration and together 
with other acquisition-related costs are classified as  
non-underlying transaction costs in the income statement  
(see note 2.3).

the equity-settled PRSUs is calculated as at the grant date using the 
share price.

 — PSUs (Equity-Settled) 

PSUs are promises to issue shares at the end of a three-year vesting 
period. The number of shares a participant will receive upon vesting 
is determined by a performance modifier, which is adjusted based on 
Tradeweb’s total shareholder return over a three-year performance 
period. The fair value of the equity-settled PSUs is calculated as at  
the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation model.

 — Options 

Tradeweb awards options with a four-year graded vesting schedule, 
one half vesting based solely on the passage of time and one half 
vesting only if Tradeweb achieves certain performance targets.  
Costs related to options are recognised as an expense in the income 
statement over the service period. 
The fair value of options is calculated as at the grant date using the 
Black-Scholes model.

 — RSUs 

RSUs are promises to issue shares at the end of a vesting period. 
RSUs granted to employees vest over a three-year period. RSUs 
granted to non-employee directors vest after one year. The fair value 
of the RSUs is calculated as at the grant date using the share price.

Significant accounting estimates and assumptions
See note 9 for the significant accounting estimates of intangible 
assets acquired as part of a business combination.

The purchase price allocations (PPA) (shown in 21.2 below) have been 
prepared on a provisional basis in accordance with IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations. If new information obtained within one year of the 
acquisition date, about facts and circumstances that existed at the 
acquisition date, identifies adjustments to the amounts below or any 
additional provisions that existed at the date of acquisition, then the 
accounting for the acquisition will be revised.

1  The fair values of the net assets acquired were determined based on assumptions that reasonable market participants would use in the principal (or most advantageous) market and primarily 

included significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). The following valuation methodologies were used to determine fair value:

  – Customer relationships: multi-period excess earnings method (MEEM) (income approach)
  – Software: relief from royalty method (income approach)
2  The deferred tax liability mainly comprises the tax effect of the intangible assets.

The goodwill is attributable to the anticipated growth in the underlying business and future technology not yet developed.

None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Accounting policy
An operation is regarded as a discontinued operation if it has 
already been sold and comprised a major line of business or 
geographical area of operation. Discontinued operations are 
excluded from the results of continuing operations and are 
presented as a single amount of profit or loss after tax from 
discontinued operations in the income statement. 

If the acquisitions had all occurred on 1 January 2023, estimated Group 
revenue and adjusted EBITDA would have been as follows:

23. Transactions with related parties

The Group has a number of related parties including associates, 
Directors and Executive Committee members (see note 4.1).  
All significant transactions with related parties are carried out  
on an arm’s length basis.

Transactions with other related parties
Other related party transactions include the £750 million directed 
off-market purchase of limited voting ordinary shares from York Holdings 
II Limited and York Holdings III Limited (see note 18.1). 

Transactions with associates

24. Commitments and contingencies

A commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future. These amounts are not recorded in the balance sheet as we have not 
yet received the related goods or services. The amounts below are the minimum amounts that we are committed to pay.

The Group has the following contracts in place for future expenditure which are not provided for in the consolidated financial statements:

Contract

Description

Minimum commitment

10-year strategic partnership with Microsoft

Agreement with Reuters News, entered into  
in 2018, for a 30-year term

To architect LSEG’s data infrastructure using  
the Microsoft Cloud, and to jointly develop new  
products and services for data and analytics

To receive news and editorial content

Minimum cloud-related spend of $2.8 billion  
over the term of the partnership1

Minimum CPI adjusted payment, which was  
$368 million for 2023

1  The remaining commitment at 31 December 2023 is $2.8 billion.

In the normal course of business, the Group can receive legal claims 
and be involved in legal proceedings and dispute resolution processes 
including, for example, in relation to commercial matters, service and 
product quality or liability issues, employee matters and tax audits. The 
Group is also subject to periodic reviews, inspections and investigations 
by regulators in the UK and other jurisdictions in which it operates, any 
of which may result in fines, penalties, business restrictions and other 
sanctions. A provision for a liability is recognised when it is probable  
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a present 
obligation from past events and a reliable estimate can be made of  
the amount of the obligation. Any provision recognised is inherently 
subjective and based on judgement.

25. Events after the reporting period

r8fin acquisition
On 19 January 2024, Tradeweb acquired R8FIN Holdings LP (r8fin),  
a technology provider that specialises in algorithmic-based execution  
for US Treasuries and interest rate futures. The total purchase price 
consideration is $125 million, consisting of $90 million in cash and 
$35 million in shares of Class A common stock of Tradeweb, subject  
to working capital and other adjustments.

For many of these matters it is too early to determine the likely outcome, 
or to reliably estimate the amount of any loss as a consequence and 
therefore no provision is made. While the outcome of legal and 
regulatory matters can be inherently difficult to assess and/or the 
potential loss often cannot be reliably estimated, we do not believe that 
the liabilities, if any, which could result from the resolution of the legal 
and regulatory matters that arise in the normal course of business are 
likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial 
position, profit, or cash resources. However, it is possible that future 
results could be materially affected by any developments relating to  
any such legal and regulatory matters.

Purchase of non-controlling interests
In February 2024, LSEG acquired 3.24% of the share capital in  
LCH Group Holdings Limited from certain minority shareholders  
for €168 million, taking LSEG’s ownership of LCH Group Holdings 
Limited to 85.85%.

1  At 31 December 2023, the Company held 7,632,733 (2022: 3,797,344) treasury shares which were acquired as part of its share buyback programme.
2  The merger relief reserve is a potentially distributable reserve arising as a result of shares issued to acquire subsidiaries.
3  The capital redemption reserve was set up as a result of a court approved capital reduction scheme and is non-distributable.
4  Dividends declared and paid are disclosed in note 8 of the Group's consolidated financial statements. The Board proposed a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023 of 

79.3p per share (31 December 2022: 75.3p per share).

5  The share buyback is disclosed in note 18 of the Group's consolidated financial statements.
6  The Board approved the allotment and issue of 98,134 ordinary shares at par to the EBT (2022: 883,174 ordinary shares at par) and the transfer of 1,904,252 treasury shares (2022: nil) to settle 

employee share plans.

7  The share-based payments movements recognised within equity for the year ended 31 December 2022 have been disaggregated to be consistent with 2023.
8  Following the transfer of treasury shares to the EBT and the consequent increase in its net assets, the impairment of loans to EBT recognised in prior years has been reversed by £77 million.

Notes to the Company financial statements

Reporting entity

These financial statements have been prepared for London Stock Exchange Group plc (the “Company”). The Company is a public limited company, 
incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is 10 Paternoster Square, London, EC4M 7LS.

1. Accounting policies

This section describes the Company’s material accounting policy 
information that relates to its financial statements and notes as a whole. 
Where an accounting policy relates to a particular note, it is disclosed  
in that note. These policies have been consistently applied to all the 
periods presented, unless otherwise stated. 

1.1 Basis of preparation 
The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework. The Company adopted FRS 101 on  
1 January 2023 with a transition date of 1 January 2022 and there were 
no adjustments to prior period information as a result of this change. 

The following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101 have been 
considered and applied where deemed to be applicable: 
 — Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment 
(details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of  
share options, and how the fair value of goods or services received 
was determined)

 — IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
 — Paragraph 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (including 
disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value 
measurement of assets and liabilities)

 — The following paragraph of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 

– 10 (d) (statement of cash flows) 
– 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS) 
– 111 (cash flow information) 
– 134-136 (capital management disclosures)

 — IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows
 — Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in 

Accounting Estimates and Errors (requirement for the disclosure of 
information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been 
issued but is not yet effective)

 — The requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose 
related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party  
to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member

 — Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (key management 

compensation) and paragraph 18A of IAS 24 Related Party 
Disclosures, related to key management services provided by  
a separate management entity

 — IAS 36 Impairment of Assets disclosure of impairment reviews
 — Paragraphs 88C and 88D of IAS 12 Income Taxes (qualitative and 

quantitative information about its exposure to Pillar Two income taxes) 

The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except 
for derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value. The 
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis (see 
note 1.2 to the consolidated financial statements for this assessment).

2. Income statement

As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company’s income statement has not been presented in these  
financial statements.

1.2 Significant accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements
Estimates, assumptions and judgements are regularly reviewed based 
on historical experience, current circumstances and expectations of 
future events. There are no significant accounting estimates, 
assumptions and judgements in the preparation of the Company 
financial statements that have a significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in its financial statements.

1.3 Material accounting policy information applied in the current 
reporting period that relates to the Company financial statements  
as a whole
Foreign currencies
The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the 
Company’s functional currency.

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded and translated 
into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate prevailing at 
the reporting date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such foreign currency transactions or from the 
translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the income statement, either within 
operating expenses or net finance costs depending on the nature of  
the item or transaction.

Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated. Non-monetary items measured at fair 
value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined. The 
foreign exchange gain or loss on assets and liabilities carried at fair 
value is reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. This means 
foreign exchange gains and losses on non-monetary assets and 
liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in  
the income statement within operating expenses.

Taxation
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to taxation authorities.

Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s equity holders are recognised 
as a liability in the Company financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

2.1 Employees
The Company had no employees in the year (2022: nil). Details of 
Directors’ emoluments are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 117 to 153.

2.2 Auditors’ remuneration
The fees paid or are payable to the Company’s auditors, Ernst and 
Young LLP, and its associates for 2023 in respect of audit services  
were £0.6 million (2022: £0.5 million).

3. Investments in subsidiaries

4. Trade and other receivables

Accounting policy
Investments in subsidiaries, as well as loans and other 
contributions to subsidiaries, are recognised at cost less 
accumulated impairment.

Investments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment when 
events indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
When an indication of impairment is identified, the investment’s 
recoverable amount is estimated as the higher of its fair value 
less costs of disposal and its value-in-use. An impairment loss  
is recognised when the recoverable amount of an investment  
is less than its carrying amount.

25,355

Accounting policy
Amounts due from Group companies are initially measured at 
fair value and are subsequently reported at amortised cost less 
provision for expected credit losses. Allowances for expected 
credit losses are made based on the risk of non-payment, taking 
into account ageing, previous experience, economic conditions 
and forward-looking data. 

The Company has a tax indemnity receivable from Thomson 
Reuters for any tax liabilities incurred before Refinitiv (previously 
the Thomson Reuters Financial & Risk Business) separated  
from Thomson Reuters on 1 October 2018. The tax indemnity 
receivable is measured on the same basis as the corresponding 
indemnified tax liabilities. When there is a change in the 
indemnified tax liabilities, which is recognised within tax in the 
income statement, there is an offsetting change in the tax 
indemnity receivable. This change is recognised within  
operating expenses in the income statement.

in London Stock Exchange Reg Holdings Limited to fund acquisitions and investments.
3  On 31 December 2023, the Company contributed 100% of the shares of LSEG US HoldCo, 
Inc. with carrying value of £1,797 million to Refinitiv Parent Limited in exchange for Refinitiv 
Parent Limited issuing new ordinary shares to the Company for £2,098 million.

4  Following a dividend payment from London Stock Exchange Group Holdings (Italy) Limited 

and the consequent reduction in its net assets, the value of the Company's investment in the 
subsidiary has been reduced by £770 million to the recoverable amount that is based on the 
net asset value (as a proxy for fair value less costs of disposal) of £150 million. The fair value 
is classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

A full list of the Group's subsidiaries as at 31 December 2023 is provided 
in note 10.1.

Accounting policy
Borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of amounts 
received, net of capitalised direct issue costs and arrangement 
fees (including upfront facility fees).

Subsequently, these liabilities are carried at amortised cost. 
Interest payable on the borrowings, direct issue costs and 
arrangement fees (including upfront facility fees) are recognised 
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings  
using the effective interest method.

Accounting policy
Amounts due to group companies are initially recognised at  
fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Accrued expenses are recognised for goods and services 
received before the end of the year for which no invoice has 
been received. They are measured at amortised cost. 

Non-current

Bank borrowings – committed bank facilities1

The Company has a tax indemnity payable to Thomson Reuters 
with a matching tax receivable. The tax indemnity payable is 
measured on the same basis as the indemnified tax receivable. 
When there is a change in the indemnified tax receivable, which 
is recognised within tax in the income statement, there is an 
offsetting change in the tax indemnity payable. This change is 
recognised within operating expenses in the income statement.

1  Negative balances represent the value of unamortised arrangement fees.
2  As part of the IBOR Reform, a Credit Adjustment Spread (CAS) has been applied where US dollar and sterling LIBOR rates were replaced with SOFR and SONIA rates respectively in the bank 

facilities. The CAS is variable and depends on the tenor and currency of the borrowings.

8. Share-based payments

Accounting policy
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based 
payment plans for the employees of its subsidiaries using the 
Company’s equity instruments. The share-based payment is 
recharged to its subsidiaries by the Company with a 
corresponding increase in retained earnings within equity.  
The expense is determined by the fair value (using a stochastic 
valuation model) of the options granted or shares awarded at the 
date of the grant. The calculated expenses are recognised over 
the relevant vesting periods. 

Further details on the share plans are provided in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 117–153 and note 20 to the  
consolidated financial statements.

The Company has an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) to administer the 
share plans and to acquire Company shares to meet the commitments 
to Group employees. At 31 December 2023, 1,178,957 Company shares 
were held by the trust (2022: 259,129). The EBT is fully funded by the 
Company via loans, cash gifts and the issue and transfer of shares.  
The cost of the shares held by the EBT are recognised directly in equity.

Alternative Performance Measures

An Alternative Performance Measure (APM) is a financial measure 
of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or 
cashflows, other than a financial measure defined or specified in 
the applicable financial reporting framework. APMs should be 
considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, IFRS 
measures of financial performance and liquidity. The Group’s 
APMs are defined below.

Non-underlying items
The Group classifies income or expenses as non-underlying 
when it does not arise in the normal course of business and it is 
material by amount or nature... This can include: amortisation  
and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets; 
incremental amortisation and impairment of any fair value 
adjustments of intangible assets recognised as a result of 
acquisitions; and tax on non-underlying items, as well as any 
other income or expenses not considered to drive the  
operating results of the Group. More information can be found in 
note 2.3 to the consolidated financial statements on page 181.

‘Adjusted’ measures
We use ‘adjusted’ measures including adjusted EBITDA to assess 
the profitability and performance of our business.

The ‘adjusted’ measures reported by the Group are:
 — Adjusted operating expenses before depreciation,  

amortisation and impairment

 — Adjusted EBITDA1
 — Adjusted depreciation, amortisation and impairment
 — Adjusted operating profit
 — Adjusted net finance costs
 — Adjusted profit before tax
 — Adjusted profit for the year1
 — Adjusted earnings per share (EPS)2,3

These are not measures of performance under IFRS but provide 
supplemental data that help convey an understanding of the 
Group’s financial performance and exclude non-underlying items 
per the above definition above. For more information on our 
adjusted measures, refer to note 2 to the financial statements  
on page 180.

1  Adjusted profit for the year is used to calculate adjusted EPS and is reconciled  

to profit before taxation in note 7 to the financial statements on page 194 and on  
the face of the income statement.

2  Adjusted profit for the year is used to calculate adjusted EPS and adjusted diluted 

EPS and is reconciled to profit before taxation in note 7 to the consolidated financial 
statements on page 194 and on the face of the consolidated income statement  
on page 171.

3  While basic EPS reflects all Group activities, diluted EPS takes into account the 
dilutive effect that would arise on conversion or vesting of all outstanding share 
options and share awards under the Group’s share option and award schemes. 

Constant currency growth
We serve customers in over 170 different countries and a 
significant proportion of our income is generated in currencies 
other than our reporting currency, sterling. Movements in 
exchange rates can therefore have a significant impact on our 
reported financial growth rates and so it can be helpful for us 
remove this volatility when assessing business performance. We 
calculate constant currency growth rates – for P&L items down to 
and including the operating profit line – on the basis of consistent  
FX rates applied across the current and prior year period.

Organic (constant currency) growth
In the last two years, we have completed five material acquisitions 
and one disposal. We measure organic growth rates in order to 
compare business performance to prior periods independent  
of this activity. Organic growth is calculated on a constant 
currency basis, adjusting the results to remove disposals from  
the entirety of the current and prior year periods, and by including 
acquisitions from the date of acquisition with a comparable 
adjustment to the prior year.

(Equity) free cash flow
We use equity free cash flow to determine residual cash inflow  
or outflow, after operational usages of cash such as interest 
payments, taxes paid, dividends paid to minority interests and 
capital expenditure. Equity free cash flow represents the cash  
that we have available to distribute to shareholders via dividends 
and buybacks, and for other uses such as M&A activity. Unless 
specified otherwise, references to “free cash flow” in the  
Annual Report should be taken to mean equity free cash flow.  
For a reconciliation from equity free cash flow to reported cash 
flow, refer to page 56.

(Dividend) payout ratio
Our dividend payout ratio or “payout ratio” represents the ratio of 
the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders relative to our 
adjusted earnings per share.

Annualised Subscription Value (ASV) growth
Our ASV growth metric measures the year-on-year expansion in 
the annualised value of our book of subscription contracts,  
at a point in time. By annualising the value of contracts that  
have recently been initiated, the metric should act as a leading 
indicator of Data & Analytics subscription growth (96% of Data  
& Analytics revenue).

Cost and revenue synergies
We use our cost and revenue synergy programmes to quantify 
the financial value directly generated by LSEG’s acquisition of 
Refinitiv, which closed in January 2021. Our runrate synergy 
achievement figures represent the incremental annual revenue  
or cost savings delivered as a result of synergies between  
the two legacy organisations, which were identified prior to  
the acquisition.
