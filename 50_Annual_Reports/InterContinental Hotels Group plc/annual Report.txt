IHG  |  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

This has been another important year 

of progress for IHG Hotels & Resorts, 
characterised not only by excellent 

financial performance underpinned by 
strong guest demand and further growth 
with our owners, but also a smooth evolution 
of leadership and strategy that positions 
the business for an exciting next chapter. 

The backdrop to these achievements was 
one of travel demand ahead of 2019 in many 
markets and strong recovery in others, while 
the attractiveness of our brand portfolio saw 
the continued expansion of our footprint in 
high-value markets and segments. This has 
been achieved thanks to significant 
investment in recent years across every 
aspect of IHG’s enterprise platform to 
strengthen our competitive edge and offer 
for guests and owners. 

In what was my first full year as Chair, I have 
been impressed in my conversations with 
senior leadership, wider colleagues and 
on market visits with how the business works 
together to make this happen, with guests 
and owners central to every plan. I have also 
valued time spent meeting many owners 
who clearly appreciate this commitment to 
continuous improvement and delivering 
strong returns.

Leadership changes 
Elie Maalouf became Group CEO on 1 July 
2023, succeeding Keith Barr, who stepped 
down following more than 30 years with the 
business, including six as CEO. I would like to 
thank Keith for his outstanding contribution 
and leadership, which included growing 
IHG’s brand portfolio, strengthening its 
enterprise, embarking on a 10-year 
responsible business plan and helping the 
business navigate the Covid-19 pandemic 
with such agility, clarity and care. 

We place great value on succession 
planning and talent development, and Elie 
brings significant industry experience and 
an excellent track record within the business. 
Having successfully led IHG’s Americas 
operations for eight years, where he oversaw 
record profits, growth of the region’s estate 
and the launch of new brands and formats, 
the Board was unanimous in its assessment 
that Elie was the best candidate for the job. 

This was one of several leadership changes 
in 2023 that underlines the depth of talent 
at IHG, with Michael Glover replacing 
Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson as Chief Financial 
Officer, Jolyon Bulley becoming Americas 
CEO and Heather Balsley replacing Claire 
Bennett as Global Chief Customer Officer. 
Each individual brings industry expertise, 
a track record of excellent results and a deep 
understanding of IHG and its business, and 
I have great confidence in the leadership 
team delivering success on the next stage 
of IHG’s growth journey. 

Importance of strategy 
Elie is already instilling great passion and 
energy for using the strong enterprise 
platform established in recent years to realise 
the full growth potential of the Company. 
Central to this progress is having a clear 
ambition and effective strategy, and Elie 
has introduced refreshed versions of both 
to the business in 2023 to sharpen our 
focus on growth, succeed in a competitive 
marketplace and prioritise long-term value 
for all stakeholders. 

The hotel industry brings joy like no 
other – connecting people and helping 
communities thrive. IHG and our hotels have 
a central role to play, united by a purpose of 
providing True Hospitality for Good for the 
benefit of all stakeholders. This purpose is 
embedded within our brands and culture 
and is therefore unchanged within our 
refreshed strategy. It also underpins our 
Journey to Tomorrow programme, which 
ensures our commitment to operate and 
grow responsibly across the environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) agenda is 
woven into the fabric of the business. 

The Board fully supports the evolution 
of our strategy. It stays informed of how 
colleagues are engaging with business 
priorities and IHG’s wider culture through 
feedback forums, including the work of 
our designated Voice of the Employee 
Non-Executive Director and IHG’s Colleague 
HeartBeat survey. 

Angie has succeeded Jo as Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee and joins 
the Responsible Business and Nomination 
Committees. Sir Ron Kalifa joined in January 
2024, bringing many years of technology 
industry experience across strategy, sales, 
marketing and operations, and joins the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. 

Shareholder returns 
Following a strong financial performance 
this year, I am pleased to announce the 
Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 104 cents per ordinary share, an increase 
of 10% on the final dividend for 2022. 
An interim dividend of 48.3 cents was paid 
in October 2023, taking the total dividend 
for the year to 152.3 cents, representing 
an increase of 10% on 2022. An additional 
$750m was also returned to shareholders 
through a share buyback programme 
(completed in December 2023), taking the 
total returns for the year to $1bn, and the 
Board has approved a further share buyback 
of $800m for 2024. The Board expects 
IHG’s business model to continue its strong 
long-term track record of generating 
substantial capacity to enable investment 
plans that drive growth, fund a sustainably 
growing ordinary dividend, and allow 
surplus capital to be returned to our 
shareholders. 

Looking ahead, as a global business, we 
must remain alive to potential challenges 
created by political instability and conflict 
in parts of the world, but the industry has 
proven its resilience over many years and its 
future is a bright one. An expanding middle 
class in emerging markets, rising GDP, and 
consumer appetite to travel and stay in 
branded hotels all remain fundamental 
drivers of industry demand and future supply 
growth. With strong leadership, talented 
teams and a refreshed strategy focused on 
capitalising on the powerful enterprise we 
have created in recent years, I am confident 
in IHG’s ability to drive performance, growth 
and shareholder value. 

There is real momentum in the business for 
the year ahead, and I’d like to thank all our 
colleagues for their hard work and dedication, 
and our owners for their continued 
confidence in IHG. 

Deanna Oppenheimer
Non-Executive Chair

Our purpose, ambition, strategy and 
behaviours are all being applied to an 
asset-light, fee-based, largely franchised 
business model. This remains a great 
strength of IHG, with a regional approach 
enabling flexibility by market, and high cash 
generation supporting enterprise investments 
across brands, loyalty and technology that 
enhance performance and drive growth, 
and also create surplus funds to return 
to shareholders. 

During the year, important strategic 
progress was made on several fronts. 
Enhancements to IHG® One Rewards 
strengthened loyalty, we introduced new 
capabilities to our mobile app to enhance 
the guest experience and drive owner 
returns, and the launch of Garner™ added 
a 19th brand to our portfolio in a midscale 
segment with significant growth potential. 
A cornerstone of how we work with owners 
is helping them run an efficient business and 
new procurement programmes and brand 
prototypes were among key updates to 
strengthen operational and commercial 
support alongside close collaboration with 
the IHG Owners Association. Further steps 
were also taken towards our Journey to 
Tomorrow commitments across our people, 
communities and planet agenda. 

The role of the Board 
Amid a shifting global macro-economic 
landscape, the role of the Board has been 
to support and constructively challenge the 
Executive Committee (EC) around how we 
prioritise, manage risk, grow and generate 
future value. Focus areas spanned our 
approach to cybersecurity risk management 
– including emerging risks, such as the rise 
of artificial intelligence – how we optimise 
owner returns, and growth plans in the 
context of a competitive landscape. 

To support IHG’s operations and growth 
aspirations, I place great importance on 
ensuring our Board represents a rich blend 
of backgrounds, expertise and experience 
that reflects the focus of the business and 
the evolving corporate landscape. 

As part of clear succession plans, several 
Board changes took place during the year. 
Jo Harlow retired following nine years of 
excellent service, and we welcomed two 
new Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Angie Risley joined in September, bringing 
a wealth of board and senior management 
experience from a career in HR spanning 
executive roles across sectors including 
hospitality, retail and banking.

IHG  |  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Q  What have been the highlights since 
becoming Group CEO in July 2023? 

A  It is an honour to lead this iconic company 
and one of many highlights so far has 
been getting even closer to our markets. 
I’ve really valued time spent meeting 
colleagues, owners and shareholders 
on visits across the world, seeing the 
relationships we have built, hearing 
first-hand what we are doing well, where we 
need to go further and how we can best 
work together to achieve shared success. 

IHG has enormous growth potential and I’m 
inspired by the passion of our teams and 
the power of their collaboration to drive 
performance and returns using the strong 
enterprise platform we have built in 
recent years. My predecessor, Keith Barr, 
played a major role in laying the foundation 
for an exciting chapter ahead, and I would 
like to take the opportunity to thank him 
on behalf of everyone at IHG. 

Q  How did the Company perform in 2023? 

A  Testament to the strength and scale of 

our brands and wider enterprise platform, 
I am proud to say we delivered an excellent 
financial performance alongside strong 
system size and pipeline growth. Very 
healthy average daily rate and occupancy 
pushed global RevPAR ahead of both 
2022 and 2019 levels, with leisure leading

the way, and business travel and group 
activity improving steadily. The Americas 
continued its upward trajectory with 
RevPAR up 7.0% year-on-year, EMEAA 
was up by +23.7% following a strong 
performance in Continental Europe and 
the reopening of Japan, and Greater 
China increased by 71.7%, reflecting 
a strong rebound in demand following 
the lifting of pandemic restrictions. 

That performance, coupled with fee 
margin growth and disciplined cost 
management, helped drive operating 
profit to more than $1bn for the first time. 
We returned $1bn to shareholders through 
ordinary dividend payments and a $750m 
share buyback programme, and a new 
$800m share buyback programme for 
2024 has been approved.

Our brands continued to grow around 
the world, too. We opened 275 hotels, 
contributing to net system size growth of 
3.8%, and signed another 556 properties 
into our global pipeline, which now stands 
at 2,016 hotels – or 32% of today’s system 
size. Notably, our openings and signings 
performance in Q4 was one of our 
biggest ever for development activity. 

We can be proud of this performance 
alongside all we have done to strengthen 
our business further on multiple fronts 
for guests and owners. On behalf of the 
Executive Committee, I would like to 
thank all our hotel and corporate teams 
for delivering this excellent performance, 
and our owners for their continued 
commitment to IHG. 

Q  How has IHG’s strategy changed since 

you became Group CEO? 

A  Our strategy needs to constantly evolve in 
this dynamic industry. Having added eight 
brands to our portfolio in the past six years 
and made big investments in the enterprise 
platform that supports them, it was 
important to reassess how IHG capitalises 
on what we have built to unlock and drive 
growth in a competitive landscape. 

Our purpose of True Hospitality for Good 
remains unchanged and is something that 
resonates strongly across the organisation, 
in our communities and with those we 
work with. However, our strategy has 
evolved, starting with a simpler ambition 
that sharpens our focus on what is central 
to accelerating growth: being the hotel 
company of choice for guests and owners. 
We have also refreshed our strategic pillars 
and looked carefully at the behaviours 
we need to deliver them successfully. 
Relentless Focus on Growth establishes a 
targeted approach to expanding our brands 
in high-value markets; Brands Guests and 
Owners Love shows our explicit intention 
to deliver for both; Leading Commercial 
Engine recognises the importance of 
investing in the technology and tools that 

drive commercial success and make the 
biggest difference to guests, owners and 
hotel teams; and Care for our People, 
Communities and Planet remains 
unchanged and in step with our Journey 
to Tomorrow plan. These elements 
combined are designed to drive us further 
and faster towards realising IHG’s full 
growth potential. 

Q  What strategic progress was made 

in 2023? 

A  We advanced on multiple fronts, 

strengthening our ability to capture guest 
demand, deepening loyalty, and driving 
returns and new growth opportunities 
with our owners. 

Our Holiday Inn Brand Family’s enduring 
appeal saw it generate 38% of openings 
and signings in the year. We continued 
to diversify our exposure to different 
segments, with our Luxury & Lifestyle 
brands now representing 14% of our system 
size and 22% of our pipeline – around 
twice the size it was five years ago. Almost 
a quarter of signings globally were in this 
high-fee segment, and flagship openings 
included the Regent® Hotels Carlton 
Cannes and Shanghai on The Bund. 

We also continued to expand our offer in 
other areas where we see strong demand 
and growth opportunities. We launched 
our conversion brand Garner in the 
midscale segment – worth $14bn today in 
the US alone. Our first two hotel openings 
and seven signings were achieved within 
months of launch in the US, and the brand 
is already now heading for Japan and 
Mexico. All our newer brands are gaining 
traction, with the seven launched or 
acquired in recent years – not including 
Garner or our commercial agreement 
with Iberostar – now accounting for 16% 
of our pipeline. Conversions also remain 
an important focus for us across all 
segments, reaching record levels of 37% 
of openings and signings combined. 

Looking across the enterprise more 
broadly, IHG One Rewards members 
booked more than 55% of our room 
nights globally in 2023, and in what 
was a record year for enrolments, the 
programme has now grown to more than 
130 million members. Our mobile app 
generated 38% more revenue in 2023 on 
the back of fresh updates to personalise 
the guest experience and grew downloads 
by 60% year-on-year. Collectively, the 
impact of these investments and more 
are creating increasing value for our 
owners, with enterprise contribution 
rising from 72% to almost 80% in the past 
three years. At the same time, we have 
kept guest satisfaction at a four-year 
high and we remain focused on working 
closely with our owners to reduce the 
cost to build, open and operate our hotels. 

As we strengthen the business, it is 
important we do so responsibly for 
our people and the world around us. 
Maintaining an inclusive, engaging 
culture is vital to our success, so seeing 
IHG once again named a Kincentric 
Global Best Employer was a special 
moment. We continued to support our 
communities by responding to natural 
disasters, creating opportunities for 
people to learn new skills in our industry, 
and making a positive difference to 
thousands of people during Giving for 
Good month. We also took further steps 
to reduce our environmental impact in 
several areas, including incorporating 
more energy conservation measures into 
brand standards, educating colleagues 
on food waste and delivering more 
sustainable events for corporate clients. 

Q  How do you see the future of the 

hotel industry? 

A  The long-term prospects for our industry 
are very attractive when you consider 
global population growth, rising middle 
classes and prosperity in emerging 
markets, and people’s inherent desire to 
travel. Oxford Economics is forecasting 
the number of global hotel room nights 
consumed to grow annually at an average 
rate of +4.0% from 2023 through to 2033. 

In the Americas, the world’s biggest 
tourism market, where IHG has almost 
4,500 hotels, industry forecasts expect 
room nights to increase from 2.3 billion 
to 3.0 billion by 2033. In Greater China, 
where we strengthened our position as 
the leading international hotel company 
this year with the opening of our 700th 
hotel, an extra 660 million room nights 
are forecast over the same period. 
Meanwhile, across EMEAA, there is growing 
travel demand across key markets, from 
Asia and the Middle East to Europe. This 
landscape underpins global net new supply 
growth for our industry. Over the past 
decade, supply has grown annually at an 
average rate of 2.4% and it is expected to 
continue at a similar rate into the future. 

These fundamentals and the outlook 
have remained strong through varying 
economic cycles, and so while as a global 
business we must always remain agile in 
an evolving macro-economic landscape, 
we look forward to an important next 
chapter of growth for IHG and value 
creation for our owners and shareholders.

Industry overview

We operate in an industry with high growth potential, 
underpinned by strong long-term fundamentals.

The global hotel industry continued 

to strengthen in 2023, benefitting 
from further consumer appetite 
for leisure stays and a robust return of 
business demand, which together drove 
record RevPAR levels.

The $700 billion hotel industry has 
compelling structural growth drivers, 
underpinned by factors including the 
inherent needs and desires to travel for 
business and leisure purposes, population 
growth, and an expanding middle class in 
emerging markets with increasing disposable 
incomes. Spend on travel continues to be 
among the most resilient of discretionary 
areas for consumers, while demand for 
business travel remains robust, with hotels 
adapting to support flexible working trends 
in the post-Covid-19 environment. Although 
there are uncertainties within the wider 
economic outlook, we anticipate a number 
of tailwinds persisting through 2024, 
including further progress in returning to 
pre-Covid-19 levels of demand for group 
travel to meetings and events, as well as the 
ongoing recovery of travel demand to and 
from Greater China as international flight 
capacity continues to increase.

In what is a relatively fragmented sector, 
with 56% of rooms affiliated with a global 
or regional chain, competitor pressures in 
the branded space remain intense as all 
major players pursue growth strategies 
through a combination of organic growth, 
partnership arrangements and acquisitions. 
Branded hotel penetration has steadily 
increased as a long-term trend, with this 
expected to continue to grow as consumers 
look to trusted brands to meet their evolving 
expectations, particularly when it comes to 
state-of-the-art technology and the skills, 
scale and resources required to provide 
guests with enjoyable, effective and 
sustainable stays. 

While there have been short-term challenges 
impacting the completion and opening of 
new-build hotels, primarily driven by the cost 
and availability of financing, there remains 
a long-term need for new hotel supply to 
satisfy the demand drivers previously 
mentioned. Global hotel room net new 
supply increased at a CAGR of 2.4% over the 
10 years from 2013 to 2023, with industry 
forecasts showing a similar rate across the 
next five years.

Cost remains a significant barrier to building 
a scale position in the global hotel industry, 
whether that’s due to investment to build 
and maintain the properties, establish 
strong loyalty programmes and technology 
platforms, or to develop and market leading 
brands. Hotel owners affiliated with a major 
global brand and enterprise system also 
tend to generate higher returns.

The hotel industry is cyclical: long-term 
fluctuations in RevPAR tend to reflect the 
interplay between industry demand, supply 
and the macro-economic environment. 
At a local level, political and economic 
factors, as well as those such as terrorism, 
oil market conditions and significant 
weather events, can also impact demand 
and supply.

While the potential for macro-economic 
challenges from factors such as persistent 
inflation, higher borrowing costs and 
geopolitical flashpoints create some 
ongoing uncertainty in 2024, the attractive 
industry fundamentals that led to the sector 
outpacing global economic growth in 19 out 
of 24 years between 2000 and 2023 remain 
very firmly in place for the long term. 

As a global business, with a footprint in 
over 100 countries, operating in the midst 
of change and uncertainty is something 
IHG is very used to and it continues to be 
one of our greatest strengths. Our strategy 
of developing a strong brand portfolio and 
an industry-leading loyalty programme, 
together with our fee-based income streams 
and prevalent midscale positioning, means 
we remain resilient through varying 
economic cycles.

Branded hotel business models
There are two principal business models:

•  A fee-based, asset-light model:

•  An owner-operated, asset-heavy model:

 – Franchised: owned and operated by 
parties distinct from the brand, who 
pay fees to the hotel company for use 
of its brand.

 – Managed: operated by a party distinct 
from the hotel owner. The owner pays 
management fees and, if the hotel 
uses a third-party brand name, fees 
to that third-party, too.

 – Owned: operated and branded by 
the owner who benefits from all 
the income.

 – Leased: similar to owned, except 

the owner-operator does not have 
outright ownership of the hotel but 
leases it from the ultimate owner.

Asset-heavy models generate returns on the real estate and centralise control over 
operations. Asset-light models typically enable faster growth and generate higher 
returns. This model tends to present lower risk to fluctuations in the economy.

Our business model

We predominantly franchise our brands  
and manage hotels on behalf of third-party

IHG  |  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

The growth of our business relies 

on two fundamental drivers: 
increasing revenue per available 

room (RevPAR) and expanding the number 
of rooms in our system. RevPAR indicates 
the value guests ascribe to a given hotel, 
brand or market, and grows when they stay 
more often or pay higher rates. Room supply 
also reflects capturing structural growth 
drivers of increasing demand to travel and 
experience, as well as how attractive the 
hotel industry is as an investment from an 
owner’s perspective.

To drive growth, we have a portfolio of 
19 brands across more than 100 countries in 
the Luxury & Lifestyle, Premium, Essentials, 
Suites and Exclusive Partners categories. 
Supported by a leading loyalty programme 
and powerful technology, our brands meet 
clear guest needs and generate strong returns 
for our owners, which in turn attracts further 
hotel investment and grows our system size.

IHG is an asset-light business, and our focus 
is on growing fee revenues and fee margins, 
which we can do with limited capital 
requirements. This enables us to grow and 
invest in our business while generating high 
returns on invested capital and strong 
cash flow.

We generally franchise or manage hotels, 
with the decision largely driven by market 
maturity, owner preference and, in certain 
cases, the particular brand. Hotels in the 
Essentials category tend to be franchised, 
while Luxury & Lifestyle hotels are 
predominantly managed.

Our broad geographic spread and weighting 
towards essential business and domestic 
leisure has driven comparative resilience 
during times of economic downturn. Although 
this continues to be a core component of 
our business, we have made excellent 
progress in expanding our presence in the 
Luxury & Lifestyle segment, which generally 
generates higher fees per room. This category 
is currently 14% of IHG’s system size, though 
comprises 22% of the future growth pipeline.

Our asset-light business model means we 
do not employ colleagues in franchise 
hotels, nor do we control their day-to-day 
operations, policies or procedures. That 
being said, IHG and our franchise hotels 
are committed to delivering a consistent 
brand experience, conducting business 
responsibly and sustainably so that we 
deliver our purpose of providing True 
Hospitality for Good.

Fees to IHG in relation to the licensing 
of our brands and, if applicable, hotel 
management services.

Assessments and contributions 
that are collected for specific use 
within the System Fund, as well as 
reimbursable revenues.

For the small number of hotels 
(representing <1% of our system size) 
that we own or lease, we record the 
entire revenue and profit of the hotel 
in our financial statements.

IHG fee revenue

System Fund and 
reimbursable revenues

2023:

$2,164m

2023:

$2,460m

Franchised hotels
We receive a fixed percentage of rooms 
revenue when a guest stays at one of 
our hotels. This is our fee revenue.

RevPAR X Rooms X Royalty rate

Managed hotels
We generate revenue through base 
management fees and incentive 
management fees.

Fixed % of total hotel revenue as a 
management fee and typically a share 
of hotel gross operating profit after 
deduction of management fees

Exclusive partners
We receive marketing, distribution, 
technology and other fees for providing 
access to our enterprise platform.

Fee streams similar to our 
asset-light model

Revenue attributable to IHG comprises:

•  Fee business revenue from 

reportable segments:

 – Franchise fees

 – Management fees

 – Commercial agreement fees

 – Central revenue (principally 
technology fee income)

•  All revenue from owned, leased and 

managed lease hotels.

  See page 85 for more information.

System Fund
IHG manages a System Fund for the 
benefit of hotels within the IHG system 
and their third-party owners, who pay 
contributions into it. This includes a 
marketing and reservation assessment 
and a loyalty assessment.

The System Fund also benefits from 
proceeds from the sale of IHG One 
Rewards points under third-party 
co-branding arrangements.

Given the significant scale of the 
System Fund, IHG can make substantial 
investments in marketing brands, 
creating a leading loyalty programme 
and powerful technology, including 
revenue management systems, thereby 
strengthening the IHG enterprise.

The System Fund is not managed to 
a profit or loss for IHG over the longer 
term, but for the benefit of hotels in the 
IHG system, and comprises:

•  Assessments and contributions paid 

by hotels.

•  Revenue recognised on consumption 
of IHG One Rewards loyalty points.

Reimbursable revenues
In a managed property, the Group 
typically acts as employer of the 
general manager and, in some cases, 
other employees at the hotel, and is 
entitled to reimbursement of these 
costs. The performance obligation is 
satisfied over time as the employees 
perform their duties, consistent with 
when reimbursement is received.

  See page 66 for more information.

Our business model

IHG  |  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Strategic Report

Our business model continued

How we drive operating profit

Our asset-light business model requires 
a limited increase in IHG’s own operating 
expenditure to support our revenue 
growth, which delivers operating profit 
and fee margin growth.

The benefit of operational efficiencies, 
along with brands and markets becoming 
more mature, supported fee margin 
expansion of around 130bps a year 
between 2009 and 2019 in total for IHG.

For franchised hotels, the flow through of 
revenue to operating profit is higher than it 
is at managed hotels, given the fee model 
and our well-invested scale platform where 
limited resources are required to support the 
addition of an incremental hotel. This is most 
evident in our Americas region, where fee 
margins are the highest, reflecting our scale 
and over 90% of our hotels operating under 
our franchised model.

Across our managed hotels, the flow 
through of revenue to profit can be lower, 
given higher operating expenditure on 
operations teams supporting the hotel 
network.

a  Use of Non-GAAP measures: In addition to performance measures directly observable in the Group Financial Statements (IFRS measures), additional financial measures 

(described as Non-GAAP) are presented that are used internally by management as key measures to assess performance. Non-GAAP measures are either not defined under 
IFRS or are adjusted IFRS figures. Further explanation in relation to these measures can be found on page 84 to 88 and reconciliations to IFRS figures, where they have been 
adjusted, are on pages 226 to 231.

Our owned, leased and managed lease hotels tend to have significantly lower margins than our fee business. This is because we not 
only record the entire revenue of the hotel, but also the entire cost base, which includes staff and maintenance of the hotel.

Capital expenditure
Spend incurred by IHG can be summarised as follows:

Type

What is it? 

Recent examples

Maintenance capital expenditure 
and key money

Recyclable investments to drive 
the growth of our brands and our 
expansion in priority markets

Maintenance capital expenditure is devoted 
to the maintenance of our systems and 
corporate offices, along with our owned, 
leased and managed lease hotels.

Key money is expenditure used to access 
strategic opportunities, particularly in 
high-quality and sought-after locations, 
when returns are financially and/or 
strategically attractive.

 Recyclable investments are capital used to 
acquire real estate or investment through 
joint ventures, equity capital, or loans to 
facilitate third-party ownership of hotel 
assets. This expenditure is strategic to help 
build brand presence.

We would look to divest these investments 
at an appropriate time and reinvest the 
proceeds across the business.

System Fund capital investments 
for strategic investment to drive 
growth at hotel level

The development of tools and systems that 
hotels use to drive performance. This is 
charged back to the System Fund over the 
life of the asset.

Examples of maintenance spend include 
investment in corporate technology and 
software, as well as office refurbishment 
and maintenance. Across our owned, 
leased, and managed lease hotels we 
invest in refurbishment of public spaces 
and guest rooms.

Examples of key money include 
investments to secure representation for 
our brands in prime locations.

Examples of recyclable investments in 
prior years include our EVEN Hotels 
brand, where we used our capital to 
develop three hotel properties in the US 
to showcase the concept. These hotels 
were subsequently sold and now 
operate under a franchise agreement. 
More recently, recyclable investments 
have included the initial purchasing of 
sites for the Six Senses brand to be 
developed in key markets in the US.

We continue to invest in a range of 
upgraded technology solutions, 
including the ongoing development of 
IHG’s mobile app and IHG One Rewards 
loyalty evolution.

Dividend policy and shareholder returns
The Board consistently reviews the 
Group’s approach to capital allocation 
and seeks to maintain an efficient balance 
sheet and investment-grade credit rating. 
IHG has an excellent track record of 
returning funds to shareholders through 
ordinary and special dividends, and share 
buybacks. The ordinary dividend paid to 
shareholders increased at an 11% CAGR 
between 2004 and 2019, and at a 10% 
CAGR after resuming dividend payments 
at the end of 2021.

Our asset-light business model is highly 
cash generative through the cycle and 
enables us to invest in our brands and 
strengthen our enterprise. When 
reviewing dividend recommendations, 
the Board looks to ensure that any 
recommendation does not harm the 
sustainable success of the Company 
and that there are sufficient distributable 
reserves to pay any recommended 
dividend. The Board assesses the Group’s 

ability to pay a dividend bearing in mind its 
responsibilities to its stakeholders and its 
objective of maintaining an investment-
grade credit rating. One of the measures 
we use to monitor this is net debt:adjusted 
EBITDA and we aim for a ratio of 2.5-3.0x.

In February 2023, IHG’s Board proposed 
a final dividend of 94.5¢ in respect of 
2022, representing growth of 10% on that 
for 2021. The proposal was subsequently 
approved at the AGM and paid to 
shareholders on 16 May 2023.

$500m of surplus capital was returned 
via a buyback programme announced in 
August 2022 and then a further $750m via 
a subsequent programme over the course 
of 2023. The highly cash-generative nature 
of our business model means we expect to 
have substantial ongoing capacity to return 
further surplus capital to shareholders, such 
as through share buybacks, as we look to 
move leverage into our target range 
over time.

The Board intends to continue sustainably 
growing the ordinary dividend and to typically 
pay dividends weighted approximately 
one-third to the interim and two-thirds to the 
final payment. 

In August 2023, IHG’s Board declared 
an interim dividend of 48.3¢ per share, 
representing growth of 10% on 2022’s 
interim dividend. This was paid to 
shareholders on 5 October 2023.

The Board is proposing a final dividend of 
104.0¢ in respect of 2023, representing 
growth of 10% on that for 2022. The 
proposed total dividend for the year is 
therefore 152.3¢. Further, the Board have 
approved a share buyback programme 
to return an additional $800m of surplus 
capital in 2024. Given expectations for 
growth and EBITDA in 2024, leverage is 
expected to be around the lower end of 
our target range of 2.5-3.0x.

Trends shaping our industry

Over the past few years, 
the travel and tourism industry 
has demonstrated its enduring 
importance for millions globally. 
Despite the backdrop of short-
term macro pressures and 
uncertainty, consumers continue 
to value and feel passionately 
about travel, with surveys 
indicating it to be among the 
most resilient of discretionary 
spending areas. As we look to 
2024 and beyond, we are seeing 
the evolution of several trends 
and travel habits that are likely 
to strengthen in our industry 
over the coming years. 

This section focuses on three trends that are 

becoming increasingly prominent in our industry; 
the rise of blended travel supported by the shift 

to remote working in recent years; increased interest in 
sustainable travel; and the growing role of technology, 
which is creating more opportunities for personalised 
travel experiences.

1 Blended 

travel 

The rebound in business travel has reignited another trend – 
blended travel, where business and leisure are combined into one 
stay, by either taking the time to explore the local destination during 
a business or work trip, or by adding a holiday onto the beginning 
or end of a business trip or conference. 

A shift to remote working in recent years is contributing to the rise 
in popularity of blended travel. According to a 2023 survey by the 
Global Business Travel Association (GBTA), business travellers are 
blending business and personal travel more frequently than they did 
in 2019. Additionally, guests are increasingly extending their trips, 
with 42% of travellers adding leisure stays to their business trips 
in 2023 and 79% staying at the same accommodation for business 
and leisure portions of their trip. Blended travel is set to become 
more popular in the coming years, with Euromonitor forecasting 
that global spend by travellers combining business and leisure will 
more than double by 2027 compared with 2021.

Alongside blended travel, the growth in popularity of co-working 
can provide an opportunity for hotels to reimagine under-used 
spaces and appeal to new guests, particularly younger generations, 
and attract the local population.

Our responses include:
•  Continuing to roll out the innovative Open Lobby for Holiday Inn® 

in new markets, which gives guests and visitors a welcoming 
space to relax, work or socialise.

•  Launching new concepts such as Meetings Without Boundaries for 
Crowne Plaza® Hotels & Resorts to capitalise on the rising demand 
for flexible meetings and gatherings.

•  Expanding our portfolio of extended stay properties across our 

Suites collection, including Candlewood Suites® and Staybridge 
Suites®, to offer guests an unparalleled extended stay experience.

2 Increasing focus 

on sustainability

Technology enhancing 
guest experiences 

Guests and organisations are increasingly focused on the 
environmental impact of their travel. A study by the World Travel and 
Tourism Council (WTTC) revealed that 75% of travellers are looking 
to choose sustainable travel in the future, while 59% have chosen 
some form in recent years. Business customers are also increasingly 
paying closer attention to sustainability, with 92% of business travel 
professionals stating it is a priority for their organisation, according 
to a recent survey by GBTA. This trend is set to strengthen, with 
increased public scrutiny, more media coverage, and stricter reporting 
rules leading to more companies reporting on their GHG emissions. 

As sustainability concerns grow, guests are expected to choose 
companies prioritising sustainable practices. However, according to 
a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study, 10% of consumers currently 
prioritise sustainability as a top driver of choice when making travel 
purchasing decisions. Travel companies must continue collaborating 
to establish shared frameworks that enable guests to easily access 
and act on sustainability information – for example, improving 
booking tools to display relevant sustainability details across the 
travel ecosystem.

Technology is redefining the travel experience, from helping inspire 
guests for their next trip to customising their in-room stay experience. 
Guests increasingly rely on digital technology, such as social media, 
web searches and online reviews, for inspiration and information. 
In fact, 75% of travellers say they have been inspired to travel to 
a specific destination by social media, while 48% want to travel 
to destinations that will allow them to ‘show off on social media’, 
according to a survey by American Express Travel.

According to Deloitte research, hotels are among the most popular 
categories of personalisation among customers (47%) and many 
customers are willing to pay more for a customised product or 
service. This includes booking a room with a view or more space or 
being able to stream content from their devices to their in-room TV. 

Hotel companies are also continuing to leverage advances in artificial 
intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and analytics to create more 
personalised and targeted experiences for guests, and to help inform 
marketing, customer service and revenue forecasting.

Our responses include:
•  Progressing towards our Science-Based Target (SBT) through 
initiatives such as driving energy efficiency across our existing 
hotels, facilitating access to renewable energy opportunities and 
developing plans for new-build hotels that operate at low carbon.

•  Supporting hotels with the launch of the new Meeting for Good 
sustainable meetings programme and by facilitating access 
to leading third-party sustainability certification programmes. 

•  Playing an active role in cross-industry conversations focused on 
driving visibility, alignment and clarity in sustainability initiatives 
relevant to travellers, including corporate customers. 

Our responses include:
•  Launching IHG® Wi-Fi Auto Connect to allow members to 

connect to the hotel’s wi-fi automatically, seamlessly and securely 
upon arrival.

•  Launching a next-generation IHG mobile app to give our guests 

more choice and unlock the benefits of our transformed IHG One 
Rewards loyalty programme.

•  Rolling out the ability to upsell unique room attributes across 

the estate, enabling a more seamless and personalised 
booking experience.

A brand 
for everyone

Our focus on having a diverse 
selection of brands has transformed 
our portfolio, enabling us to meet the 
needs of a broader range of guests 
and owners, while growing our estate 
to more than 6,300 hotels globally.

Our investment in the quality of our established 

brands, coupled with the introduction of 
eight new additions over the past six years, 

has significantly expanded our offer across segments 
ranging from Essentials and Suites to Premium and 
Luxury & Lifestyle. 

The demand for branded players continues to drive 
fresh opportunities to reach scale in high-growth 
markets, as guests seek new experiences and owners 
look for more ways to grow with us. This year, we 
launched our 19th brand, Garner. Designed for the 
midscale conversion space and complementing our 
new-build brand avid™ hotels, its arrival signals our 
intent to establish an industry-leading presence in 
midscale, just as we have in upper midscale with our 
iconic Holiday Inn Express® and Holiday Inn® brands. 

Accounting for 37% of openings and signings combined 
globally in 2023, conversions continue to grow in 
importance and Garner strengthens our offer by giving 
owners quick access to IHG’s scale, enterprise platform 
and loyalty programme. 

We also continue to diversify the mix of our estate, with 
our Luxury & Lifestyle brands increasing our exposure 
to high-fee income segments. IHG is now one of the 
industry’s biggest players in this segment, with Luxury 
& Lifestyle collectively representing 22% of our pipeline 
– around twice the size it was five years ago. 

To support the growth of all our brands, we continue 
to invest in our enterprise, including our digital channels, 
a transformed IHG One Rewards loyalty programme and 
a powerful marketing campaign behind our IHG Hotels 
& Resorts masterbrand to grow awareness of our brands 
and drive demand to our hotels.

embarking on our Journey to Tomorrow to invest

Our purpose of True Hospitality for Good remains at the

but as an organisation, we have simplified our ambition 
to focus on what is central to accelerating growth: being 
the hotel company of choice for guests and owners. 

To make it happen, we have fine-tuned our strategic 
pillars and introduced new behaviours to sharpen our 
mindset for success and accelerate our growth by 
capitalising on what we have built. 

Over the long term, with disciplined execution, our strategy 
drives the growth of our brands in high-value markets. 
It creates value for all our stakeholders and delivers 
sustained growth in cash flows and profits, which can be 
reinvested in our business and returned to shareholders.

We are accelerating the global growth of our brands

In 2023, we launched our midscale conversion brand 
Garner, grew and strengthened both new and existing 
brands, and extended our presence in Luxury & Lifestyle. 

We are focused on delivering tailored services and 
solutions to meet the expectations of guests and owners. 
In 2023, this included strengthening guest benefits for

IHG  |  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

We have grown our portfolio from 

11 to 19 brands in just six years 
alongside significantly investing 

in the quality of our existing ones to fuel 
demand from owners and guests globally. 
This transformed portfolio is increasing the 
breadth of our offer across every segment. 
Supporting our brands is a sharper, stronger 
enterprise, including our award-winning 
IHG One Rewards loyalty programme, 
masterbrand and a transformed web 
and mobile experience.

Our focus is on using what we have built 
to grow our brands at pace in high-value 
markets and segments around the world. 

What we achieved in 2023

We opened 275 hotels in 2023 to surpass 
6,300 globally and signed another 556 to 
our pipeline, taking it to 2,016 hotels. Our Q4 
openings and signings performance was one 
of our biggest-ever quarters for development 
activity, while across the year we saw 31 hotel 
openings represent a debut in a new country 
for a particular IHG brand. 

The enduring appeal of our heritage brands 
was seen in Essentials, where our Holiday 
Inn Brand Family generated 38% of hotel 
openings and signings globally, and in 
Premium, where Crowne Plaza reached 
534 open and pipeline hotels, supported 
by a modernised Americas estate and 
growth in markets such as Greater China, 
where it is the leading upscale brand.

To unlock the growth potential of what is 
already one of the industry’s biggest Luxury & 
Lifestyle portfolios, we made organisational

Strong progress with newer brands continued. 
Celebrating its fifth birthday, avid reached 
67 open hotels, including its first in New York, 
while Atwell Suites™ grew its pipeline to 41. 
To support demand in the US, we are 
educating lenders about the performance, 
revenue opportunities and return on 
investment of these two brands and have 
provided owners with ground-break incentives 
to speed up building time. Also continuing 
its growth trajectory, Vignette Collection has 
now secured 29 Luxury & Lifestyle properties 
in two years since launch, while fast-growing 
Premium brand voco™ hotels achieved debut 
openings in Japan and Vietnam on the way 
to reaching 136 open and pipeline hotels. 
In our Exclusive Partners category, 49 out 
of up to 70 Iberostar Beachfront Resorts 
properties were added to IHG’s system to 
capitalise on the growing demand for resort 
and all-inclusive stays. 

Specifically in Greater China, we surpassed 
700 open hotels in 2023. The pace of 
development activity has increased since 
we introduced our franchising model a few 
years ago as part of a shift away from a more 
managed estate. This model is now available 
across Holiday Inn Express, Holiday Inn, 
Crowne Plaza, EVEN™ Hotels and voco, and 
by the end of 2023 had contributed to 38% 
of our open estate and more than 50% of 
our pipeline in the region.

What’s to come

We have grown our development pipeline 
to more than 2,000 hotels, the equivalent 
of 32% of today’s system size. This, coupled 
with key investments in our enterprise, sets 
the stage for sustainable system size growth 
in the years ahead.

Crowne Plaza Utrecht – Central Station,  
the Netherlands

Our focus areas include extending the 
leadership of our Essentials brands, such as 
Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express, in major 
markets by building on our work to optimise 
the cost to build, open and operate. 

We will speed up conversion deals to 
capitalise on owner demand and growth 
opportunities, including taking Garner 
to scale quickly in the midscale segment. 
We will also work closely with owners to 
continue expanding other newer brands, 
such as avid and Atwell Suites, as part of 
a more comprehensive owner engagement 
strategy designed to accelerate building and 
ramp-up for new hotels across our estate. 

In Luxury & Lifestyle, we will focus on 
asserting our leadership of this higher-fee 
space by embedding our growth strategy 
and new operational approach, as well as 
expanding our branded residences offer. 

The first Garner Hotel officially opened in Auburn, Washington in the US on 18 December, 2023

changes to ensure central support teams 
and regional colleagues work together to 
create offers tailored to local market priorities. 
We reached 150 openings and signings in this 
segment in 2023, including the first Vignette™ 
Collection in the Americas and the return 
of InterContinental® Hotels & Resorts to 
Rome – one of 37 openings and signings for 
the brand as its pipeline reached 100 hotels 
for the first time. With properties secured 
in more than 20 countries, the rapid global 
expansion of Kimpton® Hotels & Restaurants 
continued, including a debut signing in Saudi 
Arabia. The iconic Regent Carlton Cannes was 
among several halo properties showcasing 
key brand hallmarks in what was a strong year 
for the brand, where other flagship openings 
included Shanghai on The Bund. Six Senses® 
Hotels, Resorts & Spas reached a landmark 
25th property, with the opening of the 
Southern Dunes, The Red Sea in Saudi Arabia, 
while a debut opening in Sydney was among 
42 openings and signings for Hotel Indigo®. 

Underlining the pace and scale of our 
progress, our six Luxury & Lifestyle brands 
now collectively represent 22% of our 
rooms pipeline – around twice the size of 
five years ago. In November, 31 Luxury & 
Lifestyle properties were awarded Condé 
Nast Traveler’s Readers’ Choice Awards 
– 10 more than the previous year.

Our strategic focus on accelerating 
conversion deals continued to drive 
growth. They reached record levels in 2023, 
comprising 37% of openings and signings 
combined, thanks to our work to increase 
the breadth of our portfolio and strengthen 
our enterprise for owners looking for fast 
access to our scale and systems.

To further accelerate our growth, we 
launched our new Essentials midscale 
conversion brand, Garner, to complement 
our new-build avid hotels brand in the space. 
Garner gives guests one-of-a-kind trusted 
stays at a lower price point and serves 
demand from hotel owners to convert to an 
IHG brand and quickly benefit from access 
to our enterprise platform, including our 
revenue-generating systems, distribution 
channels and loyalty programme that 
support performance, increase efficiencies 
and drive returns. Since becoming 
franchise-ready in the US in September, 
Garner rapidly achieved its first seven 
signings and two openings by the end of 
the year. The brand will also head to other 
markets in 2024, including Mexico and 
Japan. We expect Garner to reach an estate 
of over 500 hotels over the next 10 years 
and 1,000 hotels over the next 20 years.

What we achieved in 2023

With strong demand around the world 
pushing RevPAR 16% ahead of 2022 levels 
and almost 11% up on 2019, we are greeting 
guests with fresh experiences, enhanced 
service and the latest technology to meet

Our IHG One Rewards programme plays 
a key role in capturing guest demand. 
Since transforming our loyalty offer in 2022, 
we have scaled its benefits, making Food 
& Beverage Rewards redeemable at more 
than 5,900 hotels globally and increasing 
Reward Nights by around 40% since 2019. 
The programme continues to gain notable 
industry recognition, too, including winning 
seven Freddie Awards in 2023, the most

enhancements, including the upsell of unique 
room attributes, where guests can seamlessly 
select add-ons and tailor their stays.

Our technology continues to improve 
customer service, with innovations being 
made through artificial intelligence (AI) 
that are providing a more intuitive guest 
experience for our Digital Concierge chatbot 
service. Speech AI is dealing with reservation 
conversations, we continue to roll out IHG 
Voice to automatically handle calls in hotels 
to reduce the burden on busy teams and our 
24/7 asynchronous service is enabling guests 
to resolve their queries with reservations and 
customer care agents via chat. With the 
growth in AI capabilities and IHG’s scale 
investment, we have already increased 
end-to-end AI-led customer self-service by 
53% in 2023 compared with a year earlier, 
with the potential for this to continue growing 
and driving additional cost-efficiency and 
effectiveness for our owners, as well as 
further increases in guest satisfaction.

We have also introduced further 
enhancements on property. This includes a 
next-generation payments system speeding 
up check-in and reducing fees for owners 
at more than 3,800 hotels in the US and 
Canada and the rollout of IHG Wi-Fi Auto 
Connect to connect IHG One Rewards 
members to hotel wi-fi automatically. 

Key updates to our brands included an 
upgraded breakfast for Holiday Inn in the 
US and Canada with streamlined labour 
costs, a vibrant new service culture for 
InterContinental to drive performance and 
growth, and improved breakfast and design 
for Holiday Inn Express in Greater China. 

The work we are doing in collaboration 
with our owners and hotel teams is making 
a difference for guests, with our Guest 
Satisfaction Index, which measures our 
outperformance against peers, continuing 
to maintain a four-year high.

For corporate guests, we are supporting 
organisations in how they are bringing their 
teams together in today’s hybrid world. 
We launched Meeting for Good to provide 
more sustainable meetings and events 
and a new programme for Crowne Plaza in 
Greater China that blends social areas and 
work spaces to meet demand for combined 
business and leisure travel. 

For our hotel owners, we remain focused on 
providing the operational and commercial 
support they need to strengthen performance 
and capture demand. IHG One Rewards is 
playing a central role, having grown to more 

voco Brussels City North, Belgium

than 130 million members in 2023. Supporting 
it in attracting consumer attention and driving 
revenue to our hotels is our masterbrand 
strategy, which is putting IHG Hotels & 
Resorts in more places, more often, to lift 
awareness and brand favourability measures. 
At the heart of this approach is our Guest 
How You Guest global marketing campaign, 
which extended its reach across markets, 
channels and events to increase IHG’s 
appeal with key demographics, supported 
by targeted regional promotions and brand 
marketing campaigns – including our largest 
ever for Hotel Indigo. 

We continue to engage closely with our 
hotel teams and owners on how we can 
best drive performance – connecting with 
General Managers on regular calls and at 
regional conferences, and with owners 
through webinars, meetings and our 
first-ever IHG Americas Premium Investors 
& Leadership Conference in 2023. 

During the year, we introduced more 
efficient design prototypes for renovations 
and new-builds across several of our brands 
and expanded our procurement solutions 
to create more resilient supply chains that 
benefit from IHG’s scale. This includes the 
rollout of our new Hotel Purchasing Services 
programme for our Essentials and Suites 
brands in the Americas and select markets 
throughout EMEAA, providing end-to-end 
support to speed up renovations and 
openings. Our Group Purchasing Organization 
agreements now cover more than 100,000 
items and our Procure-to-Pay platform in 
Europe, Greater China and the Middle East 
also allows hotels to purchase products 
collectively to reduce costs. 

Developing sustainable solutions is crucial 
to the long-term success of IHG, our owners’ 
businesses and the industry, and this year we 
have made progress while at the same time 
strengthening owner returns. For example, 
we have expanded our Community Solar

corporate clients to increase bookings and 
drive revenue.

The quality and consistency of the guest 
experience also remains a key focus – from 
loyalty recognition to property condition 
– and we will deliver training, data insights

IHG  |  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Investments in our loyalty programme, 

technology platforms, data and analytics, 
and partnerships are raising the bar on the 
guest experience and driving commercial 
performance for IHG. Every solution and 
tool we are developing is firmly focused 
on gaining competitive advantage for our 
brands, business and owners.

What we achieved in 2023

Illustrating the success of our commercial 
engine across our technology platforms, 
sales and distribution channels, in 2023 
we saw enterprise contribution from 
IHG-managed channels and sources reach 
almost 80%, up from 72% three years ago. 
Our ability to provide hotel owners with 
higher-value customers at a lower cost 
of customer acquisition in this way is key 
to the attractiveness and proven success 
of our entire enterprise.

Our transformed loyalty programme is 
playing an important role in our progress. 
Members spend approximately 20% more 
in hotels than non-members and are around 
10 times more likely to book direct. In 2023, 
we achieved a record year for enrolments, 
which were up 50% on 2022 and 24% ahead 
of 2019, taking us to more than 130 million 
members. Loyalty penetration also increased, 
with members responsible for over 55% of 
room nights globally during the year. 

We know that recognised members are also 
20% more likely to return to a property, so 
we are working closely with our hotel teams 
to embed a culture of loyalty. This includes 
setting up a taskforce providing materials, 
job aids and training for colleagues, and 

i

that incorporates leading data science 
and forecasting tools to deliver advanced 
insights and recommendations to owners as 
part of our enhanced revenue management 
services. Already in pilot, the rollout is 
targeting approximately 4,000 hotels 
in 2024. 

Work will also begin on our next-generation 
property management system to create 
greater value for owners – where a single 
cloud-based view across properties will 
enable us to deploy fast, efficient 
enhancements at scale. 

We will continue to integrate the Iberostar 
Beachfront Resorts brand into our systems 
and booking channels. This strengthens 
our all-inclusive and resort offer and lays 
the foundation for growing our Exclusive 
Partners collection by underlining the value 
of our commercial engine.

Building on the success of our relaunched 
co-brand credit cards, we will focus on the 
continued growth of our existing programmes 
and explore opportunities globally to better 
serve our growing loyalty base in key markets.

introducing incentives like Food & Beverage 
Rewards for guests to drive repeat bookings 
in a way that minimises impact on the 
bottom line for owners.

cross-sell of guest stay extras, such as F&B 
credits, lounge access, additional in-room 
welcome amenities and parking, as part of 
the redesigned booking flow.

What’s to come

We will continue to accelerate the impact 
of IHG One Rewards by scaling benefits 
and improving the on-property experience. 
This will involve data-driven marketing 
across our booking channels, while in our 
hotels we will provide further training and 
use innovative approaches to inspire 
colleagues to deliver even more consistent 
guest experiences. This includes IHG Climb 
– a new interactive gaming-based platform 
that engages hotel teams to help drive and 
enhance performance towards their hotel 
loyalty metrics. So far, it has been rolled 
out across the US and parts of Canada, 
where we are already seeing high levels of 
engagement and improved performance.

Continuing our focus on providing best-in-
class platforms, IHG’s revenue management 
system employs a new cloud-based platform 

Following the update of US co-brand credit 
cards alongside the relaunch of our loyalty 
programme, the number of new accounts 
have continued to increase very strongly 
and, in 2023, were up more than 60% 
year-on-year and over 80% on 2019 levels. 
There has also been continued growth in 
average card spend, both on a year-on-year 
basis and vs 2019.

Further deepening our relationships with 
guests and driving more business to our 
hotels, we have expanded our strategic 
partnerships to enable IHG One Rewards 
members to redeem points in exchange for 
more unique experiences at sporting events 
and music festivals, as well as exclusive 
member privileges with other leading brands. 

As the gateway to IHG One Rewards, our 
mobile app is also playing an integral role 
in driving loyalty contribution, direct 
bookings and incremental spend during 
stays. Since relaunching it in 2022, we have 
made thousands of enhancements to further 
improve the guest experience and drive 
revenue to our hotels. It has achieved strong 
user ratings in the App and Google Play 
stores and the IHG mobile app and other 
mobile channels now account for 58% of all 
digital bookings. The number of downloads 
were up 60% year-on-year, too, with revenue 
driven by the app increasing 38%.

In Greater China, we continue to enhance 
our capabilities on WeChat – the region’s 
popular messaging, social media and mobile 
payment app. Updates to the IHG WeChat 
channel contributed to an 8% increase in 
booking conversion rates year-on-year and 
it generated nearly twice as much revenue.

Our mobile app is part of a wider 
transformation of the booking journey. 
By the end of 2023, refreshed brand 
websites covering 92% of open hotels had 
been redesigned and relaunched. Linked to 
this, the upsell of unique room attributes on 
IHG’s Guest Reservation System (GRS) is 
now available in over 6,000 hotels, enabling 
guests to seamlessly select add-ons when 
making reservations, and owners to 
generate maximum value from their hotel’s 
unique attributes. Guests who select an 
upsell on our digital booking channels drive 
an average nightly room revenue increase of 
$18 across our Essentials and Suites brands, 
and $40 for Luxury & Lifestyle. Our GRS 
capabilities also enable more effective

We recognise that profit and 

growth are intrinsically linked 
to doing the right thing and 
caring for our people, the communities 
in which we operate, and the world around 
us has been at the heart of our business 
for many years. 

Guiding our actions is Journey to Tomorrow, 
our responsible business plan consisting of 
a series of commitments to 2030. This is 
underpinned by our strategic priority to care 
for our people, communities and planet, and 
aligned with the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals and IHG’s purpose of providing True 
Hospitality for Good.

Progress against our commitments, which 
include creating a more inclusive workplace, 
supporting our communities and reducing 
our carbon, waste and water usage, are 
monitored and measured by the Board’s 
Responsible Business Committee. 

Not only are our actions crucial to the world 
around us, they are increasingly important 
to our guests, owners and investors, too, 
and are therefore critical for our reputation 
and growth. Reflecting a changing world, 
each commitment focuses on areas where 
we can make the biggest impact, so that 
IHG continues to grow responsibly.

Committee Report on pages 112 and 113.

People

Champion a diverse culture 
where everyone can thrive

Our 2030 commitments
•  Drive gender balance and a doubling 
of under-represented groups across 
our leadership.

•  Cultivate an inclusive culture for our 
colleagues, owners and suppliers.

•  Support all colleagues to prioritise their 
wellbeing and the wellbeing of others.

•  Drive respect for and advance 

human rights.

Our people are fundamental to IHG achieving 
its purpose and strategic goals. IHG’s business 
model means that we do not employ all 
colleagues. We directly employ individuals 
in our corporate offices, certain reservation 
centres, and managed, owned, leased and 
managed lease hotels. However, not all 
individuals in managed, owned, leased and 
managed lease hotels are directly employed 
and, in general, we do not employ any 
individuals in franchised hotels (nor do we 
control their day-to-day operations, policies 
or procedures).

What we achieved in 2023

People engagement
We have numerous forums available for 
employees to share their thoughts, including 
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), a 
designated Non-Executive Director for 
workforce engagement, and Colleague 
HeartBeat, our employee engagement 
survey, which allows people to express their 
views on key aspects of working at IHG. 

In our 2023 survey, our overall employee 
engagement stood at 87%, a 1%pt 
improvement on last year, which once again 
saw IHG accredited as a Kincentric Global 
Best Employer. The survey also highlighted 
areas that we can strengthen further, including 
enabling infrastructure, rapid and high-
quality decision making, and rewarding and 
recognising strong performers. Ensuring 
consistent experiences across all aspects 
of work was identified as a key driver for 
future performance. Actions taken during 
2023 on talent and staffing saw a significant 
improvement in perceptions in these areas. 

Developing and retaining talent 
To achieve our growth ambitions, we invest 
in attracting and retaining a diverse and 
talented workforce through our employer 
brand, which includes our promise to 
support employees throughout their career 
by giving them Room to Belong, Room to 
Grow and Room to Make a Difference. 

Each promise is supported by programmes 
designed to enable employees to thrive both 
within the workplace and outside. 

For example, this year we piloted a new 
corporate onboarding programme in the 
US, UK, India and the Philippines aimed 
at embedding IHG’s culture with new 
employees. We celebrated each of our 
employer brand promises with a week of 
learning events. This enabled the business 
to spend time focusing on creating an 
inclusive culture where everyone can thrive, 
supporting employees in developing their 
careers and helping make a difference to 
the world around them. 

We provide learning programmes, 
masterclasses, resources and toolkits 
to ensure colleagues have the capability to 
support IHG’s performance and development 
processes. Particular focus is placed on 
having meaningful career conversations and 
helping managers and employees support 
career development.

Managers have continued to hold quarterly 
check-ins with their teams as part of our 
performance management process, 
providing feedback and guidance on goals, 
behaviours and development to ensure 
everyone is focused on the right priorities. 

Our 10-year responsible business plan

Our goal is to help shape the future of responsible travel together with those who stay, work and 
partner with us. We will support our people and make a positive difference to local communities, 
while preserving our planet’s beauty and diversity… not just today but long into the future.

Care for our people, communities and planet continued

IHG’s reward strategy aims to attract, 
retain, motivate and engage top talent. It is 
supported by a robust governance approach 
that ensures our reward and recognition 
practices are fair and consistent across 
our employee and colleague population, 
regardless of gender and other aspects of 
diversity, and there is alignment between 
the wider direct workforce and executive 
remuneration. Further details between the 
alignment of the wider workforce and executive 
remuneration can be found in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 116 to 140.

For our hotels, Journey to GM (our General 
Manager talent acceleration programme) 
continues to build a pipeline of talent to 
meet both our growth ambitions as a business 
and the aspirations of employees seeking 
rewarding careers at IHG. Following our 
first cohort in 2021, we have seen 65% of 
participants either move into their first GM 
role or receive a substantial promotion in 
our EMEAA and Americas regions. For our 
Luxury & Lifestyle GMs, we delivered brand 
immersion sessions to bring each of our 
brands to life. We also continued to develop 
our hotel talent management practices 
during 2023 so we can see critical gaps 
we need to fill. 

Investing in HR technology and 
Global Learning
In 2023, we continued to evolve our HR 
system by adding a new helpdesk and digital 
assistant, in-sourcing our HR Shared Service 
team and enhancing our support section 
within Our People Tools HR platform. 
We have transitioned from legacy payroll 
systems within the UK and US. 

Our Global Learning strategy is designed 
to ensure that we all have the tools and 
resources we need to perform at our best, 
meet the needs of our stakeholders and 
develop personally as part of our Room to 
Grow commitment. 

This year, our learning platform provided 
345,000 users across our corporate offices, 
franchised and managed hotels with access 
to flexible training so they could personalise 
their learning experience to address specific 
needs and strengthen opportunities for 
career development. 

A key element of our offer is IHG University, 
which was launched in 2023. There are four 
schools to support corporate employees, 
frontline colleagues in our hotels, GMs and 
hotel department leaders, and owners. 
The university champions individual 
learning, career development, talent 
acceleration and best practices. 

IHG University received the Brandon Hall 
Group Bronze award for excellence within 
the category of Best Advance in Custom 
Content, as well as awards for Digital 
Learning Best Practice and Best Digital 
Learning Team by Online-Edu. 

Attracting talent
To help attract the talent we need to fulfil 
our growth ambitions, we have invested 
in a comprehensive suite of channels and 
platforms. Our IHG careers website had over 
2.46 million visitors in 2023, while there has 
also been a 51% rise in visitors to our new 
digital channels, which include Instagram, 
YouTube and TikTok. This has generated 
9.32 million views of our employer brand 
content globally over the past year, which 
we are boosting with paid sponsorship of 
key job opportunities to drive thousands of 
applications for frontline roles in our hotels. 

To help tackle the industry shortage of 
talented and experienced Luxury & Lifestyle 
GMs, our dedicated Luxury & Lifestyle team 
has implemented a specialised recruitment 
strategy to address this gap and build 
further trust with our owners. 

We also continue to invest in tools and 
guides to ensure a transparent, equitable, 
inclusive and efficient hiring process to 
elevate the recruitment experience for the 
corporate and hotel candidates who apply 
to IHG each year.

Recognising the importance of attracting 
and developing talent whatever their 
backgrounds, circumstances, or abilities, 
we expanded the number of organisations 
we’re working with in the US to attract 
students to our 10-week paid internships. 
This will enable us to further diversify our 
early careers pipeline. Our work continues 
with Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities in the US, and the Leonard 
Cheshire and 10,000 Black Interns Foundation 
charities in the UK. While in Greater China, 
we have established partnerships with five 
special education schools to nurture talent 
among people with disabilities. 

Championing a diverse culture where 
everyone can thrive 
A cornerstone of our culture is our passion 
for inclusion, and our Global DE&I Board and 
regional DE&I councils help shape actions 
across our markets that are aligned to our 
Journey to Tomorrow commitments.

   Our commitment is emphasised through, 
and is backed up by our 2023 DE&I Progress 
Report, which you can find on our website: 
ihgplc.com/en/responsible-business/people

Driving gender balance across 
our leadership
Globally, 35% of our leaders working at VP 
level and above are female (vs an ambition 
of 39% by 2025), and we are one of the 
few large global organisations to have a 
gender-balanced employee population, 
of which 52% is female. 

A key focus is attracting more women into 
functions that have been historically less 
gender-balanced, such as Commercial, 
Operations, Technology and Development. 
We’re also identifying and removing barriers 
to increase the number of female GMs across 
our estate, including establishing an alumni 
network for graduates of our Rise mentoring 
programme, which empowers our female 
colleagues in our hotels. Overall, more 
than 200 women have graduated from the 
programme so far, and this year we welcomed 
an additional 162 participants. We were 
delighted to see Forbes recognise IHG as 
one of the world’s top companies for women, 
and proud to be officially certified in the US 
as a Great Place to Work for parents, as well 
as featuring in the 100 Best Places to Work 
for Women.

Doubling under-represented groups 
among our leaders
We remain committed to having leaders 
who represent the diverse global nature of 
our business. Thanks to the self-disclosure 
of employees, we know that 22% of our 
global leaders working at VP level and above 
are racially or ethnically diverse and represent 
16 nationalities. 

We have identified the UK and US – where 
we have our largest populations of corporate 
colleagues – as markets in which we want 
to increase ethnic representation. We have 
set targets for the percentage of leaders 
working at VP level and above that are 
ethnically diverse in each market – 26% by 
2025 in the US and 20% by 2027 in the UK, 
with an overall global target of 26% by 2025.

on strengthening our approach to talent

talent programmes (Ascend in the US and 
The Network of Networks’ (TNON) Ethnically

Travel & Leisure’s (WiHTL) Ethnic Future

Creating a culture of inclusion for our 
colleagues, owners and suppliers 
All EC members have a DE&I-related goal 
and, having rolled out conscious inclusion 
training for GMs and corporate employees 
in key markets in 2021, this year we made 
the training available to more than 16,000 
colleagues in our franchised hotels.

Insights from our Inclusion Index are also 
among the ways we are tracking progress. 
In 2023, the Index showed that nine out of 
10 employees considered IHG to have an 
inclusive culture. We were proud to have 
been ranked second out of 850 companies 
on the Financial Times Europe’s Diversity 
Leaders 2024 list. 

InterContinental Marseille – Hotel Dieu, France

InterContinental Fujairah Resort, UAE

This year, we have seen significant growth 
of our ERGs and now have 4,000 members 
across 29 chapters. Playing a key role in 
underlining the value of inclusion, they 
brought employees together for moments 
such as the International Day of Persons with 
Disabilities, International Women’s Day and 
Pride Month.

We are also continuing to drive inclusion 
within our hotel owner communities in the 
US and Canada by introducing IHG LIFT 
– an owner growth programme focused on 
creating more hotel development support 
for historically under-represented groups 
within the industry.

To help drive inclusion in our supply chain, 
our Engaging Partnerships through Inclusion 
and Collaboration (EPIC) supplier diversity 
programme expanded to the UK during the 
year, representing the first international 
market outside North America. We also 
recognised the diversity programmes run 
by our key suppliers, and through our EPIC 
Allies initiative they are now working with us 
to identify diverse suppliers in their respective 
supply chains. We launched our Supplier 
Diversity Tier 2 programme, too, inviting 
key suppliers who share our values to report 
their diverse spend, so that IHG can influence 
further how our supply chain creates value 
for communities across the globe. 

Working with advocacy groups is critical to 
our success in diversifying our supply chain. 
Collaborating in this way offers a bridge 
between IHG and diverse businesses to 
support our supply chain inclusion, market 
capability influence and economic 
impact goals. 

As a result of collective action in 2023, 
IHG’s total spend among diverse suppliers 
was $111 million across North America, the 
UK and Tier 2 reporting.

Supporting colleagues to prioritise their 
wellbeing and that of others
In 2023, we achieved a 2%pt increase in our 
Wellbeing Index score (to 89%) for our hotel 
colleagues. Supporting our overall approach 
to colleague wellbeing, we also launched 
a UK network of mental health first-aiders, 
helping to ensure the right support is in 
place for everyone to feel at their best, 
and we made enhancements to our UK 
healthcare plan.

Our 2030 commitments
•  Drive economic and social change 

through skills training and innovation.

•  Support our communities when natural

•  Collaborate to aid those facing 

food poverty.

With more than 6,300 hotels spanning over 
100 countries, we are proud to be at the 
heart of thousands of communities around 
the world, as we strive to make a difference 
every day by delivering our purpose of True 
Hospitality for Good. Through providing 
skills training, supporting relief efforts 
following natural disasters, and fighting 
food poverty, we aim to improve the lives of 
30 million people. In addition to direct funding 
and working with expert organisations, our 
colleagues contribute their time, skills and

their communities.

To ensure that we measure our impact and 
maintain focus on areas where we can make 
the greatest difference, we adhere to the 
global standard for managing corporate 
community impact as members of Business 
for Societal Impact (B4SI).

What we achieved in 2023

Skills training and innovation
Our IHG Academy programme is aimed 
at increasing social mobility and building 
hospitality skills for the future. In 2023, 
our IHG Academy offerings saw more 
than 30,000 participants gain valuable 
employment and life skills, as the programme 
has grown to provide work experience, 
internships, apprenticeships and free online 
learning through our IHG Skills Academy 
to users all around the world. This year, we 
expanded our offer to include cognitive 
assessments, which enabled users to 
complete personality profiles and skills 
mapping assessments to help them identify 
their ideal roles. 

   To learn more about the impact of our 
IHG Academy programmes, see our 2023 
Responsible Business Report. 

Colleagues from our Shanghai office volunteered their time at a coffee shop, which employs individuals 
with disabilities

Egypt and providing meals to low-income 
hospital patients in Mexico. More than 
270 projects focused on protecting the 
planet too, from beach and city clean-ups 
to replanting green spaces. This year, we 
also launched a tracker to help us better 
understand and celebrate the way hotels 
support their communities year-round.

Supporting our communities when 
disasters strike
We are proud of being there for our 
communities in times of need and continued 
working with a range of humanitarian aid 
organisations around the world to assist 
in their critical relief and recovery efforts. 

In 2023, we supported 15 global relief efforts, 
which included responding to several natural 
disasters, from the earthquake in Turkey and 
Syria to the hurricanes in Mexico, working 
closely with charity relief experts CARE 
International and the American Red Cross. 

We also activated the IHG Colleague Disaster 
Relief Assistance Fund on several occasions 
to support colleagues with immediate relief, 
including those affected by typhoon Mawar 
on the island of Guam.

Local action and Giving for Good month
We recognise that being in the heart of 
our communities, our hotels are best placed 
to assess local needs and provide tailored 
support where it is needed most, so we 
encourage the development of local 
collaborations in line with our policy and 
strategy for community impact. 

Each year we come together as a company 
during September for IHG’s Giving for Good 
month, which sees colleagues volunteer 
and make a positive difference in their 
communities. In 2023, we worked with 
over 1,400 charities across events spanning 
nearly 80 countries. Colleagues collectively 
contributed more than 89,000 volunteering 
hours to communities, causes and charities, 
adding to a total of more than 121,000 
volunteering hours during the year. Efforts 
throughout the month made a positive 
difference to the lives of over 248,000 
people globally. Activities included giving 
clothes to housing shelters in Canada, 
raising money to provide clean water in

Reduce our energy use and 
carbon emissions in line with 
climate science

Our 2030 commitments
•  Implement a 2030 science-based 
target that delivers 46% absolute 
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions 
from our franchised, managed, owned, 
leased and managed lease hotels.

•  Target 100% new-build hotels to operate 

at very low/zero carbon emissions 
by 2030.

•  Maximise/optimise the role of 

renewable energy.

Working closely with our hotel owners, 
we aim to help them reduce costs while 
decarbonising and future-proofing 
their assets. 

We have set a target to reach a 46% 
absolute reduction in GHG emissions from 
our franchised, managed, owned, leased 
and managed lease hotels, from a 2019 
baseline. This target has received validation 
from the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi), aligning with climate science and 
the UN Paris Agreement.

While there was an increase in year-on-year 
emissions in 2023 due to the recovery in 
occupancy and growth in the size of the 
estate, we continued to drive energy 
efficiency with a 3.8% reduction in carbon 
emissions per occupied room from 2019, 
and a 1.9% absolute reduction against 
the baseline. 

Given our business model and the 
dependencies for achieving our ambitious 
target, we have worked closely with our 
colleagues, owners and partners to devise 
a decarbonisation strategy focused on three 
key areas: decarbonising existing hotels, 
sourcing renewable energy, and developing 
new-build hotels that operate at very low/
zero carbon emissions. 

In 2023, we moved to a more regionalised 
approach to ensure the measures we 
introduce at hotels take into account varying 
regional factors and still provide a good 
return on investment for our hotel owners.

We continued to update our brand 
standards and are integrating various Energy 
Conservation Measures (ECMs) into the 
expectations of hotels that work with us. 
All ECMs integrated into hotel brand standards 
are carefully considered, taking into account 
costs and impact. In 2022, we established 
our first set of energy efficiency global 
brand standards, and this year introduced 
further ECMs into our new-build hotel brand 
standards globally, as well as for our existing 
Essentials & Suites estate in the Americas. 
Standards include measures for lighting 
controls, occupancy-sensing thermostats 
and heat pumps. We will continue working 
on implementing additional brand standards 
tailored to each region and segment.

These ECMs will further drive energy 
reduction across our hotels and form part of 
our new ESG measure for the 2023/25 cycle 
of the Long Term Incentive Plan for Executive 
Directors and other senior leaders.

Collaborating to aid those facing 
food poverty
Our commitment to supporting local 
charities across various markets is a vital 
means of addressing food security for those 
in need. This year, we expanded our work 
with local organisations, including Windsor 
Foodshare near our Global Headquarters, 
as well as KiwiHarvest and UK Harvest. 
This expansion helps support society’s 
most vulnerable and reduce food waste. 

Our existing collaborations continued to 
thrive. We’re now in our fifth year of working 
with OzHarvest, a food rescue organisation 
in Australia, and we continue to build our 
relationship with JapanHarvest and 
VietHarvest. We also supported the Global 
FoodBanking Network, which operates in 
nearly 50 countries. This included expanding 
our work with Green Food Bank, the official 
branch of the network in China. 

Our guests are also given the opportunity 
to show their support, and in 2023, nearly 
35 million points redeemed by our IHG One 
Rewards members were donated to benefit 
the efforts of the global charities we 
work alongside.

Planet

The actions we take to deliver our Journey 
to Tomorrow plan help protect our planet 
and support the ongoing creation of more 
sustainable guest stays. We provide tools 
and information as well as work across the 
industry to help set standards to enable our 
hotels to reduce carbon emissions, manage 
waste and conserve natural resources. 
To do this, we continue to collaborate with 
hotel owners, suppliers, industry peers 
and governments.

Committee Report and GHG emissions

Waste

Pioneer the transformation to 
a minimal waste hospitality 
industry

Our 2030 commitments
•  Eliminate single-use items, or move 

to reusable or recyclable alternatives 
across the guest stay.

•  Minimise food going to waste through 

a ‘prevent, donate, divert’ plan.

•  Collaborate to achieve circular solutions 

for major hotel commodity items.

Our overarching objective is to embrace 
circularity by encouraging reuse or recycling 
of resources. This involves initiatives such 
as integrating recycled materials into new 
product manufacturing or ensuring that 
items at the end of hotel use find meaningful 
applications elsewhere. We also have 
processes and tools in place to assess the 
environmental sustainability of our suppliers 
and advise our hotels accordingly (refer to 
page 41 for updates on our responsible 
procurement progress).

In 2019, we became the first global hotel 
group to commit to replacing bathroom 
miniatures with full-size amenities, which 
has been implemented into brand standards 
across all our hotels globally. We have also 
committed to eliminating single-use items, 
transitioning to reusable or recyclable 
alternatives throughout the guest stay 
by 2030.

To further assist our hotels, we have 
developed a bespoke Single Use Items 
Toolkit for our hotel operators. Initially 
launched in EMEAA, in 2023 we made it 
available globally. It provides hotels with 
additional support and best-practice 
approach to reducing, reusing, replacing 
and recycling single-use items. Our updated 
sustainability credentials for our guest 
supplies, encompassing items like 
toothbrushes and razors, have been 
successfully implemented by many 
of our hotels this year in EMEAA.

Food waste is a key issue for the hospitality 
industry and we use a ‘prevent, donate, 
divert’ plan to minimise landfill contributions. 
At the industry level, we collaborate with 
peers to ensure a unified approach to 
collecting, measuring and reporting waste. 
All our hotels have access to food waste 
training as part of the GM training programme, 
which encourages hotels to track food waste 
and take action. Since its launch in 2022, 
the training has been accessed by more 
than 1,600 hotels and over 37,000 courses 
have been completed by managed and 
franchised colleagues. 

We also use a range of technology to 
address the challenge – whether that’s an 
app that connects hotels with customers or 
communities when they have unsold surplus 
food or analytics to pinpoint areas of waste 
and provide chefs with real-time information. 

Being part of IHG ensures hotel owners 
receive the support, knowledge and 
resources necessary to help reduce their 
energy consumption and carbon emissions. 
One key example of this is our Hotel Energy 
Reduction Opportunities (HERO) tool, which 
guides hotels on effective actions tailored to 
specific buildings. It provides indicative 
capital costs, energy savings and payback 
periods based on the hotel’s facilities, climate 
and energy use. In addition, we are actively 
working to ensure that owners can access 
government incentives for sustainability 
measures requiring greater investment. 

We are developing plans for hotels that 
operate with very low/zero carbon emissions. 
This includes a low-carbon hotel programme, 
focused primarily on the operational aspects 
of new-build hotels, to support delivery of 
our carbon and energy goals. We expect 
to launch this programme in 2024.

With the majority of our hotels operating 
through franchise agreements, we cannot 
directly procure renewable energy for most 
of the properties in our estate. However, we 
seek to help all our owners secure access to 
renewable energy, and have been exploring 
which options would be suitable for scaling 
across our estate. 

One example of how we have been able to 
support our hotels is through our Community 
Solar programme, which is available in 
select markets across the US and requires 
no capital expenditure. It is currently active 
for IHG hotels across four states, with more 
to follow soon, where legislation supports 
the initiative and there is available capacity. 
Our commitment also extends to procuring 
renewable electricity for six of our global 
offices, including our Global Headquarters 
in Windsor in the UK and our Americas 
Headquarters in Atlanta in the US, as well as 
more than a quarter of our managed estate 
in Europe.

Water

Conserve water and help 
secure water access in those 
areas at greatest risk

Our 2030 commitments
•  Implement tools to reduce the water 

footprint of our hotels.

•  Mitigate water risk through stakeholder 

collaboration to deliver water 
stewardship at basin level.

•  Collaborate to ensure adequate water, 

sanitation and hygiene (WASH) 
conditions for our operating communities.

With insufficient global water resources to 
meet everyone’s needs compounded by the 
escalating frequency of extreme weather 
events and droughts, it is important that 
we identify hotels in areas of high or very 
high water stress. This insight is crucial for 
tailoring our business strategy effectively, 
providing targeted support to these hotels, 
and implementing water-saving measures.

We have been part of the United Nations 
(UN) CEO Water Mandate since 2019, which 
represents a pledge to six core commitments 
that mobilise business leaders on water, 
sanitation and the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). We are also 
members of the Water Resilience Coalition, 
which aims to raise global water stress to the 
top of the corporate agenda and preserve 
the world’s freshwater resources through 
collective action and ambitious, quantifiable 
commitments. Our membership has helped 
to inform our work to identify and manage 
water supply, so that we can build on the six 
water stewardship pilot projects we have 
carried out in recent years.

Acknowledging the challenges in sustaining 
a reduction in water use in the coming years, 
we mandate reporting on water usage in our 
hotels through the IHG Green Engage™ 
system and have integrated water reduction 
measures into our brand standards globally. 
These standards require hotels to implement 
high-efficiency, low-flow aerated shower 
heads and taps by the end of 2025. 

On average, these initiatives reduce water 
consumption by 11 litres per minute and 
three litres per minute respectively. 

Collaborating with water specialists is crucial 
when aiming to maximise impact and bring 
about positive change in water-related issues. 
When a devastating earthquake struck Turkey 
and Syria in 2023, IHG donated to CARE 
International to help it deliver essential WASH 
items to those seeking refuge. The hygiene 
kits provided included items that are crucial 
to improving sanitation for vulnerable 
communities and preventing disease, 
such as soap and towels.

What’s to come

People 

Communities 

Planet 

We will continue to support our employees 
throughout their career journey, providing 
tools and resources to ensure everyone 
has Room to Grow, Belong and Make a 
Difference. We will focus on building line 
manager capability and enabling a 
high-performance culture.

We will continue to invest in talent 
management to enhance our approach 
to recruitment, alongside building on our 
successful 2022 campaign to strengthen 
our General Manager pipeline in support 
of our growth aspirations, particularly in 
the Luxury & Lifestyle segment. We will also 
enhance our learning curriculum for this 
population, centred around the key luxury 
capabilities we know we need to build for 
the future.

We are committed to ongoing 
collaboration with expert charities to 
assist those in greatest need globally. 
We will actively seek new opportunities 
within our communities to further 
strengthen our collective impact and 
engage our guests, employees 
and colleagues. 

To ensure our hotels make the biggest 
possible positive impact within their 
communities, we will support them in 
establishing local collaborations to help 
those who need it most. To encourage 
further engagement, we will use our new 
Community Tracker to measure the 
impact of actions and celebrate success 
by continuing a monthly recognition 
programme.

We will continue embedding our inclusive 
culture and working towards clear 
commitments to make IHG a place where 
everyone can thrive at all levels within 
the business.

We will continue to expand our IHG 
Academy, including providing more work 
experience opportunities in our hotels 
and more learning resources on the IHG 
Skills Academy virtual learning platform. 

Work has begun upgrading our IHG 
Green Engage system so that it is more 
user-friendly and makes greater use of 
analytics to provide hotels with even richer 
insights across energy, water and waste. 
Pilots were completed during the year, 
resulting in positive feedback from hotel 
teams, and our improved environmental 
management platform will be launched 
in 2024. 

To support the delivery of our carbon and 
energy goals, we will also be launching 
a low-carbon hotel programme, which 
is primarily focused on new-build hotels 
that operate with a very low/zero 
carbon footprint.

Collaboration remains crucial to meeting 
our goals, and we will continue to use our 
scale and standing when engaging with 
peers, trade bodies and governments to 
help shape policy relating to our owners 
and the sector more broadly, as well as 
secure government incentives for 
introducing sustainability measures.

Our stakeholders

Stakeholder engagement at all levels of the business is of the 

utmost importance to IHG. Various methods of engagement 
are used based on experience and developing best practice, 

including face-to-face meetings, feedback and performance 
reviews, employee forums and training. We adjust our engagement 
methods as required to ensure they remain effective for all our 
stakeholders and IHG.

IHG measures the effectiveness of our engagement methods 
through a range of metrics, including our KPIs (such as signings and 
pipeline), performance, ability to attract and retain talent, employee 
engagement survey results, adherence to the policies covered by 
our Code of Conduct and AGM results. The views and interests of 
other stakeholders, such as regulators and industry bodies, are also 
taken into consideration. They help provide a framework against 
which we measure ourselves, protect our reputation and develop 
our commercial and social awareness.

IHG  |  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

The long-term success of IHG 

is shaped by a number of 
interdependent factors, including 

our purpose, the effectiveness of our 
strategy and the resilience of our business 
model. Underlying all of these is our strong 
workplace culture, which is aligned with 
our reputation as a trusted and ethical 
company that is well governed.

Our culture is driven by our approach 
to business, including our structure and 
governance, risk appetite, controls and 
systems, workplace environment, behaviours, 
values and policies (including our Code 
of Conduct). Therefore, understanding 
these aspects of our business is critical 
to understanding how we deliver on our 
strategic priorities, risk management 
and KPIs.

Our structure and governance
The overall responsibility for ensuring that 
our culture and ways of working are aligned 
with our purpose and strategy sits with the 
IHG Board. Throughout the year, the Board 
and its Committees receive updates and 
presentations, and review metrics, reports 
and scorecards, on the delivery of our 
strategic priorities, all with the appropriate 
governance lens and in the context of our 
culture. The Board challenges and supports 
the Group’s senior leaders, particularly 
where there is a need to adopt or amend 
policies and initiatives to ensure the continued 
alignment of strategy and culture.

The Board delegates day-to-day 
responsibility for setting and embedding 
Company culture to the CEO who, together 
with the Executive Committee (EC), sets the 
tone from the top in relation to attitudes and 
behaviours to create an open and honest 
workplace environment, empowering 
employees to give feedback and freely ask 
questions about matters that concern them. 
The EC is responsible for executing the 
Group’s strategy, and keeping the Board 
informed of the Group’s operations and 
workplace culture.

IHG’s hotel development and operations 
are organised on a regional basis (Americas, 
EMEAA and Greater China) and are 
supported by global functions in the key 
areas of Marketing, Commercial & 
Technology, Finance, Human Resources, 
Corporate Affairs, and Business Reputation 
and Responsibility.

Management of the regional and global 
teams is organised into leadership teams, 
who are responsible for executing IHG’s 
strategic priorities in a manner that aligns 
with the Group’s culture and values. 
Decisions on hotel developments and 
capital expenditure go through the 
appropriate deal approval and expenditure 
committees in line with the Group’s Global 
Delegation of Authority Policy (DOA).

The DOA sets out financial commitment and 
expenditure approval controls. For those 
commitments over specified thresholds or 
for certain types of proposals, approval is 
required from the Group’s Capital Committee, 
which reports into the Executive Committee.

The Group’s corporate legal structure is 
comprised of around 370 subsidiaries 
worldwide. These entities provide the legal 
framework required to support the Group 
in making individual contracts and 
commitments.

   Information on the Board’s monitoring and 
assessment of our culture is included on 
page 103.

Risk appetite, controls and systems
Although our strategy does not consciously 
expose the business to inappropriately 
heightened risk, our risk appetite and 
tolerance are continuously reviewed by the 
Board in relation to the Group’s pursuit of 
our strategic and operational objectives and 
the expectations of our stakeholders. The 
Board reviews the portfolio of uncertainties 
that we inherently face as a fast-moving 
business, operating in a highly competitive 
market, and considers whether the choices 
we make achieve an appropriate and 
balanced response overall to opportunities 
and threats. As part of its review, the Board 
considers the impact of macro-external 
factors, including, but not limited to, 
ongoing geopolitical tensions and conflicts 
and macro-economic pressures such as 
inflation, as well as increasing expectations 
from stakeholders on our response to ESG 
issues such as climate change. 

Our risk appetite is cascaded through 
our values and behaviours, our Code of 
Conduct, DOA and other global policies, 
and how we set our goals and targets, and 
is further reinforced by frequent leadership 
communications to guide decisions and set 
priorities, including the EC’s recent refresh 
of our strategic ambitions and behaviours.

We are committed to a framework of 
monitoring and assurance processes in 
relation to our initiatives and policies, 
reviewing whether they have operated 
within acceptable risk tolerances where 
priorities have shifted or additional actions 
were required. Board and Committee 
agenda topics allow the Board to identify 
and discuss the nature and extent of 
principal (and emerging) risks, and how risk 
management arrangements have been 
adapted where required.

office spaces and the latest technology to 
bring colleagues together for global learning 
events, town halls and workshops while also 
continuing to support our teams in finding a 
balance between remote and office working. 

In 2023 we delivered cybersecurity 
awareness training to hotel colleagues 
and corporate employees, emphasising the 
importance of staying vigilant to protect 
our company against evolving cyber threats. 
Topics ranged from social engineering 
awareness and phishing prevention best 
practices, to the ways that generative AI 
introduces new information security risks 
to IHG. While we continue to implement 
measures to safeguard the integrity, 
confidentiality and availability of IHG data, 
our employees remain the most important 
layer in our control framework.

   See our people disclosures on pages 28 to 31, 
and key matters discussed by the Board on 
page 102.

Human rights
An integral part of our global approach to 
responsible business is to drive respect for 
and advance human rights in accordance 
with internationally recognised standards. 

Our Human Rights Policy sets out our 
commitment to respect the human rights 
of all individuals impacted by our business 
activities – our guests, our colleagues, 
workers in our supply chain and the 
communities in which we operate – and our 
expectation that those with whom we do 
business – including our suppliers, owners, 
and franchisees – uphold similar standards. 
We seek to advance human rights by working 
with others to strengthen our practices and 
address common industry challenges.

IHG is a member of the United Nations 
Global Compact (UNGC) and is committed 
to aligning IHG’s operations, culture, and 
strategies with the UNGC’s 10 universally 
accepted principles in relation to human rights, 
labour, environment and anti-corruption. 

To continue to enhance our human rights 
programme, a global human rights risk 
assessment was conducted this year to 
update our understanding of salient issues 
and how they are being addressed. Teams 
across our business are working together 
to develop and implement action plans in 
response to findings from this assessment. 

In 2023, we remained focused on 
addressing risks related to migrant workers 
by further embedding our Responsible 
Labour Requirements across our managed, 
owned, leased and managed lease estate. 

Workplace environment
As part of our employer brand commitment 
to provide employees with Room to Belong, 
we have taken steps to create more flexible 
workspaces that bring to life the benefits of 
hybrid working. We have leveraged modern 

This year we also strengthened our 
approach to human rights due diligence 
in the supply chain, commencing with a 
review of policies and our approach to risk 
assessment when contracting with 
new suppliers. 

   For further details on our human rights 
progress, please see pages 20 and 21 of 
our Responsible Business Report and our 
Modern Slavery Statement. 

Our behaviours
By demonstrating our growth behaviours, 
our leaders and employees create an 
environment that encourages high 
performance, while operating responsibly 
in a way that helps us achieve our strategic 
priorities and purpose. Our policies, 
communications, learning programmes 
and performance management processes 
reflect these behaviours, ensuring they act 
as a compass for how we do things and help 
us create an inclusive culture for all.

Code of Conduct and related policies
IHG’s Code of Conduct (Code) sets the 
standard for how we do business at IHG, 
and underpins our commitment to providing 
True Hospitality for Good. 

The Code seeks to enable colleagues to make 
the right decisions, in compliance with the 
law and IHG’s expectations about conduct. 

The Board, EC and all colleagues working in 
IHG corporate offices, reservation centres, 
managed, owned, leased and managed 
lease hotels must comply with the Code. 
We expect those we do business with, 
including our franchisees, to uphold similar 
principles and standards.

The Code is reviewed and approved by the 
Board on an annual basis, and is supported 
by annual e-learning requirements. We 
continue to enhance our engagement and 
measurement approaches. We monitor and 
assess how our values are being embedded 
into our culture through a variety of methods, 
such as through direct engagement, 
employee engagement surveys, tracking of 
e-learning completion and our confidential 
reporting hotline.

The Code contains an overview of our values 
and Group-level policies, including those 
relating to human rights, respect in the 
workplace, DE&I and equal opportunities, 
accurate reporting, information security, 
anti-bribery and corruption and the 
environment. It also provides guidance on 
how colleagues can raise concerns or seek 
further help.

Additional detail regarding other areas of the 
Code, such as our DE&I, human rights and 
modern slavery commitments, are outlined 
on pages 30 and 39. Initiatives to respond 
to legal, regulatory, ethical and compliance 
risks are on page 47.

  IHG’s Code of Conduct is available in 
14 languages on the Company’s intranet 
and at ihgplc.com/en/investors/corporate-

Strategic Report

Our culture – how we  
operate responsibly continued

Speaking up
A core component of our people culture 
is respect in the workplace. IHG has zero 
tolerance to any form of discrimination, 
harassment or bullying, in line with our 
Respect in the Workplace Policy. While we 
uphold our responsibility to behave ethically 
and protect IHG’s reputation, it is possible 
that in limited instances, a colleague may 
act in a way that conflicts with the principles 
set out in the Code. Guidance is given to 
report concerns directly to line managers, 
supervisors or local HR representatives. 
A confidential reporting hotline and online 
reporting facility are available and globally 
advertised. Concerns can also be reported 
to the Head of Risk and Assurance or the 
General Counsel and Company Secretary. 
The Board routinely reviews summaries of 
reported concerns and ensures processes 
are in place for investigations and follow-up.

Safety and security
IHG is committed to providing a safe, secure 
and healthy environment for all colleagues, 
guests and visitors. All operations must comply 
with all applicable health, safety and security 
laws. Beyond compliance with the law, IHG 
works to identify further improvements to the 
way safety and security risks are managed, 
and has mandatory Brand Safety Standards 
in place for all hotels globally to drive 
consistency in this area. Initiatives to respond 
to safety and security risks are on page 48.

Bribery and corruption
IHG is committed to operating with integrity. 
Colleagues are not permitted to engage 
in bribery or any form of financial crime, 
including fraud, money laundering, violations 
or circumvention of economic and trade 
sanctions and tax evasion or the facilitation 
of tax evasion. This standard also applies 
to agents, consultants and other service 
providers who do work on our behalf.

Our Anti-Bribery Policy sets out our zero 
tolerance approach and is applicable to all 
Directors, Executive Committee members, 
employees and colleagues in managed, 
owned, leased and managed lease hotels. 
It is accompanied by anti-bribery content in 
our mandatory Code of Conduct e-learning 
module. Our Gifts and Entertainment Policy 
and guidance further support our approach 
in this area. 

   Initiatives to respond to legal, regulatory, 
ethical and compliance risks are more broadly 
discussed on page 47.

IHG is a member of Transparency 
International UK’s Business Integrity 
Forum and participates in its Corporate 
Anti-Corruption Benchmark. The results 
from this benchmark help to measure 
the effectiveness of our anti-bribery and 
corruption programme and identify 
areas for continuous improvement.

Handling information responsibly
We are committed to ensuring that guests, 
loyalty programme members, colleagues, 
shareholders, owners and other stakeholders 
trust the way we manage data. As part of 
our privacy and information security 
programmes, we have standards, policies 
and procedures in place to manage how 
personal data can be used and should 
be protected. Our e-learning training 
for employees on handling information 
responsibly is a mandatory annual 
requirement and covers topics such as 
password and email security, using personal 
data in accordance with our policies and 
privacy commitments, how to work with 
vendors and transferring data securely.

In addition to the cybersecurity awareness 
training mentioned on the previous page, 
this year we held tabletop exercises to 
practise our ability to detect and respond to 
potential security events, such as ransomware 
attacks. We continue to develop our privacy 
and security programmes to address 
evolving requirements and take account 
of developing best practice. The Board 
regards cybersecurity as a critical business 
discipline and it regularly receives updates 
on the Group’s cybersecurity risk 
management and control arrangements.

relating to data and information usage, storage, 
security and transfer and cybersecurity on

Growing our business innovatively 

and sustainably, while working 
to the highest standards of 

business conduct, plays a crucial role 
in our supplier selection processes and 
in how we continue to work with our 
existing suppliers. We are committed to 
working with suppliers who not only meet 
our minimum ethical standards but also 
share the values of our responsible 
business plan – Journey to Tomorrow.

What we do already
Our supply chains are split between hotel 
and corporate spend. Hotel procurement 
predominantly occurs at the local level 
because our hotels are primarily owned 
by independent third-party franchisees 
responsible for managing their own 
supply chains. In some key markets, 
the IHG Procurement team has created 
procurement programmes for certain 
goods and services related to building, 
opening, renovating and operating a hotel, 
which hotels and owners can leverage. 
Our corporate supply chain covers 
expenditure areas such as technology, 
office buildings and facilities management, 
marketing and professional services. 

To help manage and monitor our 
corporate supply chain, an enterprise-wide 
procurement system is in place to govern 
and oversee third-party corporate 
expenditure. We are also continuing to 
roll out procure-to-pay systems to support 
managed hotels. Several global technology 
and outsourcing providers have been 
identified as strategic supplier relationships 
given the nature of their services. IHG 
engages with these suppliers to harness 
innovation, provide customer service, 
manage risk, and promote value realisation. 
We annually review this list of strategic 
suppliers and their delivery of our 
business objectives.

We continue to integrate ESG pre-contract 
criteria in our supply chain due diligence 
activities. To ensure that suppliers operate 
with the same integrity and respect as we 
do, IHG requires new corporate suppliers 
to confirm their acceptance of the IHG 
Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code) 
at the onboarding stage or demonstrate 
that they have equivalent policies in place. 
It is also a contractual requirement for 
centrally-negotiated programmes from 
which our hotels can purchase. 
Recommended guidance is additionally 
provided to managed and franchised 
hotels when purchasing locally. At the 
end of 2023, 100% of new suppliers had 
signed the Supplier Code. 

Our spend intelligence tool is enriched 
with additional data feeds to provide a 
broader view of the supplier, including 
better visibility of IHG’s focus areas such 
as labour practices, supplier diversity, 
sustainability (including emissions), 
and financial risks. 

IHG continues to comply with the statutory 
reporting duties on payment practices 
and performance. 

Corporate and hotel supply activities 
are driven by our Procurement 
strategy and guided by our 
responsible business agenda, with 
oversight from IHG’s Responsible 
Business Committee and Audit 
Committee. In 2023, we continued 
to build our risk programmes with 
further resourcing and refreshed 
risk profiles based on IHG’s material 
supply chain risks. Recognising that 
global supply chain risks go beyond 
Procurement, we continue cross-
functional collaboration through the 
Supply Chain Risk Council.

What we achieved in 2023
In 2023, we revised our Procurement 
Policy. Key updates included expanding 
its scope to cover above-property hotel 
deals, revised criteria on when to engage 
Procurement, supplier due diligence 
checks required in support of our Journey 
to Tomorrow ambition, and updated our 
standard payment terms. 

Informed by a benchmarking exercise, 
we also revised our Supplier Code and 
translated it into 11 new languages. 
Some of the most significant evolutions 
were a refresh to environmental criteria, 
reflecting IHG’s Journey to Tomorrow 
commitments, and strengthening 
alignment with international human rights 
standards. With the additional translations 
of the Supplier Code, we have increased 
our ability to introduce it further across 
our supply chains. 

Following the 2022 introduction of 
EcoVadis, a supply chain due diligence tool, 
in 2023 IHG became a founding member 
of the Hospitality Alliance for Responsible 
Procurement (HARP). The Alliance aims to 
improve supplier sustainability by fostering 
close collaboration with trading partners 
to build transparency and scale positive 
impact across the industry’s value chains 
while operating with the appropriate 
governance and compliance controls.

To date, we have requested 123 suppliers 
globally to participate in the EcoVadis ESG 
risk assessment and, where applicable, 
it has become part of our new supplier 
selection processes in 2023. Insights from 
the scorecards are used to understand 
supplier performance, identify ESG risks 
in our supply chain and work with suppliers 
to improve their sustainability performance. 

With the use of a new digital solution, we 
made the first step towards segmenting 
our suppliers based on carbon emissions 
profiles. By mapping our carbon emissions 
from Purchased Goods and Services 
where we have data available, we gained 
visibility of the highest emitting categories. 

Textiles are a substantial supply chain 
commodity in the hospitality industry and 
are integral to the operation of a hotel. 
In 2021, we partnered with CARE 
International UK and a key textile supplier 
to complete a workplace gender analysis. 
This year, CARE hosted two workshops to 
understand the supplier’s gender equality 
priorities, developed a gender action plan, 
and supported this with implementation 
guidance. Looking ahead, we will monitor 
all progress made by the supplier and 
provide support if required. 

What’s to come 
We will continue our goal to increase the 
consideration of sustainable, diverse and 
resilient suppliers and explore how EcoVadis 
can be further incorporated into our due 
diligence processes. Throughout 2024, 
the ongoing deployment of integrated 
procure-to-pay systems in managed 
hotels across various regions will enhance 
responsible procurement oversight. 
This will be achieved through group-
configured systems, data management, 
streamlined processes, and enhanced 
controls. Working in partnership with our 
key suppliers, we will continue our supply 
chain mapping activities next year. 

We will also continue to support the 
implementation of sustainable solutions 
to advance the progress of our Journey 
to Tomorrow commitments and build 
hotel supply chain solutions for energy 
conservation measures. Additionally, 
as part of our supplier decarbonisation 
initiative, we will begin to monitor and 
collaborate with key suppliers to minimise 
carbon emissions associated with the 
goods and services we procure.

Our risk management

The Board’s role – constantly evolving 
our resilience in a volatile environment
The Board is ultimately accountable for 
establishing a framework of prudent and 
effective controls, that enable risk to be 
assessed and managed. It is supported in 
this by the Audit Committee, the Executive 
Committee and delegated committees. 
Our governance framework and committee 
agendas enable Board members to request 
and receive information on risk from the 
Executive Committee and senior leaders, 
together with other internal and external 
sources. New Board members are fully briefed 
on risk discussions as part of their induction.

The delivery of IHG’s refreshed individual 
strategic objectives and overall ambition 
requires us to continuously balance 
opportunities for strategic advantage or 
efficiency with the need to remain resilient 
and agile in the short and longer term. The 
Board considers and defines its risk appetite 
and tolerance as an active part of determining 
our strategic priorities. We describe the 
Board’s approach to risk appetite on page 39, 
and management teams have also considered 
their attitudes to risk during 2023. We 
recognise the trade-offs inevitably required 
to achieve our growth ambitions between 
responding to individual uncertainties and 
the need to balance interests of multiple 
stakeholders. We have again faced 
significant individual and accumulated 

uncertainties during the year from external 
events and IHG initiatives, which 
management has reacted to accordingly and 
built in to management processes. In order 
to enhance our risk management processes, 
we routinely look to apply learnings to 
continuously enhance our future resilience.

The description of the 2023 focus areas and 
activities for the Board and its delegated 
committees (see pages 90 to 142)
demonstrates active ongoing consideration 
of emerging and evolving uncertainties 
across a wide range of topics and timeframes. 
The Audit Committee reviews the principal 
risks and the appropriateness of our risk 
management system, and considers risk 
and control implications of strategic topics, 
for example, supply chain risk management 
and future assurance requirements for ESG 
targets. Across the year, this discussion of 
risk, supported by the Risk and Assurance 
team, allows for review of the overall level 
of risk within the business, our resilience to 
individual and aggregated uncertainties and 
implications for strategic decision-making.

Further detail on formal risk appetite 
and tolerance is provided in this report. 
For example, our appetite for financial risk 
is described in note 24 to the Group 
Financial Statements. 

  See pages 199 to 203 and our approach 
to taxation on page 67. 

How we think about and anticipate risk 
in relation to our strategic objectives 
Like many companies, we continue to face a 
hugely dynamic and uncertain environment 
in 2024, which includes multiple realities 
from outside IHG and other inherent 
execution risks relating to our own internal 
initiatives (for example, the delivery of 
complex technology innovation, such as 
the evolution of our revenue management 
solutions and property management systems 
– see page 23 – and integrating Iberostar 
within our portfolio of brands and commercial 
platforms – see page 27). In this context, 
during 2023, we continued to keep the focus 
and balance of our principal risk profile under 
review with management teams to further 
reinforce ownership and enhance discussion 
of attitudes to risk and uncertainty within 
key decisions. The uncertainties we articulate 
as our principal risks often present both 
opportunity and threat at the same time 
and require considered decision-making 
to achieve the best overall outcome for our 
various stakeholders. The graphic below 
illustrates the relationship between these 
realities and our principal risks.

The headlines for our principal risks are 
materially unchanged, other than further 
clarifying the contributing factors and key 
elements of resilience. These were discussed 
with management teams during the year and 
when reviewing the rearticulated strategy with 

Realities for 2024-26…
We are monitoring a range of external and internal factors that 
affect the level of uncertainty we face in relation to our 
principal risks:

•  Macroeconomic pressures – recessionary, inflationary 

and interest rate dynamics, energy and other 
cost-of-living pressures

•  Geopolitical tension and conflict, heightening cyber threats 

and supply chain disruption

•  Uncertain central bank policies and increasing development 

or financing costs for owners

•  Complex IHG initiatives or investments, including 

dependency on technology

•  Onerous and increasing legal, ethical or regulatory and 

compliance developments

•  Evolving third-party relationships and exclusive partnerships 

(for example, Iberostar Beachfront Resorts)

•  The volume and pace of growth efforts, including new 

territories and through new brands 

•  Aggressive brand, loyalty and partnership strategies from 

existing and new competitors

•  Pace of digitalisation, including Generative AI developments

•  Labour and talent scarcity and costs, including expectations 

for compensation

•  Pressure on colleague wellbeing and labour relations in 

certain markets

•  Operational efficiency and effectiveness opportunities

•  Increasing ESG regulation and stakeholder expectations 

relating to climate

How we consider emerging risks
Our business model and the long term 
nature of our relationships with our hotel 
owners mean that we must remain vigilant 
to emerging risks capable of impacting the 
achievement of our strategic priorities and 
also our longer-term growth, competitiveness, 
viability and sustainability. 

a Generative AI steering committee. 
We also have an ongoing focus on the 
risks of climate change through our TCFD 
governance structures, including the 
development of scenarios to help model 
and plan for future resilience. 

  See also pages 14 to 15 for more detailed 
discussion of trends impacting our industry.

teams in late 2023. Delivering our strategic 
objectives actively creates highly dynamic 
uncertainties with potentially fast impact. We 
continue to review trends carefully to evaluate 
the current behaviour of these risks relative to 
each other, and to discuss with management 
teams whether these trends create a need for a 
specific individual or portfolio-level response, 
including how leadership teams allocate their 
attention and the level of reporting visibility 
and assurance that may be required in 2024. 

To extend our insight on how risks are 
evolving, we also completed a survey of key 
expert contributors to risk profiles across 
IHG. They were asked to evaluate potential 
trends for each risk as we move from 2023 
into 2024, with the desired outcome to drive 
discussion by management on potential 
responses. Each Principal Risk scored an 
above-average risk rating, which suggests 
they are all trending upwards in the view 
of the survey participants. 

All principal risks are considered material 
in absolute terms. The graphic below 
shows an assessment of risk trending 
into 2024-26. We consider trending of 
inherent uncertainty levels (impact and/
or likelihood) and velocity (potential 
speed of effect on IHG’s objectives). 
Further detail for each risk is provided 
on the following pages.

We think about emerging risks as:

•  new risks, or existing risks in a new context, 
when the nature and value of the impact 
is not yet fully known or understood; and

•  factors with an increasing impact and 
probability over a longer time horizon. 

As in previous years, there are emerging 
elements in many of our principal risks. 
These include continuing shifts in 
international and domestic real estate 
ownership, the increasing reach of 
regulations, consumer travel patterns and 
evolving demands, including the use of data 
and technology across all areas of the guest 
journey and the workplace implications of 
advances in Generative AI. 

As part of our annual senior leaders meeting, 
IHG management review emerging and 
evolving megatrends with potential future 
relevance for IHG’s strategic ambitions, 
including society, technology and economic 
factors. Groups have been established to 
focus on key emerging topics, including

How we identify, discuss and escalate 
risks, including emerging factors
Management teams across IHG are aware of 
the challenges our current industry context 
creates, and that our ambition and strategic 
priorities inevitably expose us to uncertainty 
in the short, medium and longer term. 

Our confidence in achieving our priorities 
is reviewed regularly:

•  at the Executive Committee (see pages 
97 to 100 for more detail of their remit);

•  by first-line management teams with 

day-to-day responsibility for identifying 
and managing risk within key decisions, 
programmes and transactions and 
escalating where appropriate; and

•  by second-line management functions, 

which provide specialist expertise, 
support, monitoring and challenges to 
decision-makers on risk-related matters. 

The Risk and Assurance team works with 
first- and second-line teams to maintain and 
evolve risk profiles. During 2023, we observed 
extended discussions of existing and known 
risks, certain trends that are growing in 
focus and emerging risk factors that may 
impact us over the next 3-5+ years and 
which are being considered by various

Our risk management continued

The external Auditors and the Risk and 
Assurance team continue to monitor and 
engage the Audit Committee in relation 
to corporate governance developments. 
The Audit Committee will continue to 
consider its approach to sourcing assurance, 
for example, from direct reporting or 
attestations provided by first- and second-
line management teams on risk and control 
matters. The third-line Internal Audit plan 
identifies where independent assurance 
may be valuable, taking into account the 

maturity of management’s own reporting, 
and acceptable risk tolerances. Internal 
Audit also monitors the confidential 
disclosure channel to identify any emerging 
trends requiring management and/or 
Board intervention.

assurance roadmap has been developed for 
carbon data, including where assurance can 
be obtained internally on controls and when 
external independent input may be necessary 
in the coming years. 

The Audit Committee considers future 
assurance needs within the Internal Audit 
planning process, and has also debated 
potential assurance considerations for 
non-financial data disclosures, with 

  This section should be read together with the 
rest of the Strategic Report, Governance on 
pages 90 to 142, the going concern statement 
on page 241 and Risk Factors on pages 243 
to 247.

How we think about our risk management ‘system’

The risk management system remains fully 
integrated with the way we run the business, 
including how the Executive Committee 
reinforces key principles of culture and 
leadership (including ‘tone from the top’), 
how we adapt key processes and controls, 
and how monitoring and reporting is used to 
update on status and inform decision-making. 

Overall management have not made any 
material changes or repositioning of risk 
management and controls strategies, although 
several teams have reprioritised or bolstered 

activities in response to complexities of current 
work (for example, integration of partners 
and response to data regulation and geopolitical 
factors), and fast-paced technology initiatives 
(including HR and Finance system changes). 

During 2023, we also commissioned an external 
review of the maturity of IHG’s enterprise risk 
management arrangements, which has enabled us 
to identify opportunities to further enhance the 
design and consistent application of risk 
management activities in the coming years.

The identified areas of focus in the graphic 
below provide mitigation for many of the risks 
shown on the following pages. 

These should be read in conjunction with detail 
elsewhere in the Strategic Report, which helps 
to position IHG to respond to future opportunities 
and risks in delivering our ambitions, including 
strengthening our organisation through key 
strategic investments (pages 16 to 35), engaging 
proactively with stakeholders (pages 36 and 
37) and by reinforcing our strong workplace 
culture (pages 38 to 40). 

Culture  
and leadership

We made adjustments and clarifications to several policies which articulate risk appetite and tolerance. 
Changes were made to delegated authority levels, supplier code of conduct, procurement, information 
security, anti-bribery, sanctions and gifts and entertainment policies. 

Our annual Code of Conduct training was relaunched and new corporate onboarding and executive 
leadership training introduced. All corporate colleagues received communications on topics such 
as human rights, handling information responsibly (including phishing training), DE&I, wellbeing 
and sustainability.

Several teams evolved governance accountabilities and arrangements, including for supply chain risk 
oversight, fraud risk management and regional decarbonisation plans.

Risk 
Management 
‘System’ 
components

Processes  
and controls

We keep our processes and controls under review and in 2023, we undertook risk assessments for 
several targeted topics. This included initial privacy impacts within projects to leverage customer data 
for enhanced personalisation, human rights due diligence and the maturity of our fraud risk 
management framework in advance of upcoming UK legislation. 

Teams have implemented specific enhancements to process and control arrangements in relation to 
new country entry protocols for development teams, threat management for physical security risks, 
formalising and documenting privacy risk assessment processes and reviewing protocols for 
investigations arising from our confidential reporting hotline.

Monitoring  
and reporting

The use of data and technology to enable risk management and control is a key focus. 

Several teams have evolved and enhanced monitoring and reporting arrangements (including cyber, 
safety, supply chain, loyalty, privacy, channels teams), for example, presenting refreshed key risk indicators.

We have also developed technology tools and capabilities to support management of privacy, supply 
chain risk monitoring, human rights, financial governance, resilience and climate change risks.

While risk management and internal control 
arrangements are designed to provide 
appropriate response to the risks we face, 
we also need to be prepared for fast-moving 
disruptions and crises. We do not need to be fully 
prepared for every ‘unknown’, but we need to 
harness our collective knowledge and insights 

to deliver an appropriate IHG response overall. 
We have continued to maintain our overall incident 
and crisis management framework, reviewing 
learnings from our response to the war in Ukraine 
and the unauthorised systems access experienced 
in 2022, and applying these to management 
teams’ response to conflict in the Middle East. 

Risk and Assurance and Commercial & 
Technology leadership have collaborated to 
conduct tabletop exercises for cyber incidents 
and to undertake business impact analysis of 
processes and dependencies for key booking 
channels and develop playbooks in relation to 
evolving data legislation.

Why these uncertainties are important to the achievement 
of our strategic objectives over the next 2-3 years

How senior management and the Board obtained 
assurance in our risk management and resilience in 2023

In a highly competitive industry with increasing demands for 
personalisation, we must at all times anticipate and respond 
to evolving guest expectations, preferences and loyalty, while 
strengthening returns for the owners of our hotels through the 
services, technology platforms and experiences our brands 
provide, including ever increasing digitalisation of the 
guest journey. 

Our strategic objectives and ambition mean we actively pursue 
opportunities for effective investment to support our new brands, 
our loyalty programme, new exclusive partners, our Luxury & Lifestyle 
ambitions and our digital platforms. We also aim to carefully deliver 
on fundamental expectations of our individual and corporate 
guests, underpinning their trust in, and loyalty for, our brands, for 
example, for cleanliness and safety, or in relation to our response 
to climate change and our brands’ impact on the environment. 

We are very conscious that the macroeconomic environment 
remains highly uncertain and that customer sensitivity to price 
also remains heightened. There are also inherent uncertainties 
due to the way our business model operates and is evolving. As our 
franchised hotels operate as independent businesses, we are limited 
in our ability to control delivery on the ground in these properties 
and must introduce and implement guest experience initiatives 
effectively to support our owners. 

If we are unable to manage this uncertainty effectively it could impact 
our competitive positioning, our growth ambitions and our guests’ 
and owners’ trust in and preference for our brands.

Our growth ambitions require us to take calculated risks to attract 
owners while continuing to drive returns for our existing and potential 
owners. Our owners’ choice to work with IHG is dependent on our 
ability to build a portfolio of loved and trusted brands with a track 
record in delivering returns, while also continuing to invest in our 
commercial engine, brands guests and owners love, and care for 
our people, communities and planet.

Continuing macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation create 
significant pressures on owners’ financial capacity that must be 
considered carefully as we pursue opportunities to drive brand 
preference and focus on relentless growth. Our owners have 
increasing choices in how they invest in a highly competitive market, 
and we need to move fast to pursue opportunities in relation to 
hotel building, hotel conversions, renovations and hotel opening 
projects, while evolving and enhancing our brand portfolio and 
continuing to drive loyalty delivery across our open hotels. 

These opportunities need to be balanced with the risks associated 
with increasingly complex deal structures with owners and other 
possibilities for new strategic relationships, uncertainties as we 
expand into new markets and a need to risk our own capital to 
pursue inorganic growth or to incentivise deals in key locations for 
key brands. We also recognise our responsibilities as a franchisor 
or manager of our brands (including our role in hotel safety and 
security, ethical and social matters, and increasing expectations 
in relation to decarbonisation).

If we fail to respond effectively to this risk, we will lose competitiveness 
and may not realise the opportunities to grow our brand footprint.

The Board considers reporting and insight from 
management, including on:

•  individual and brand category, loyalty and responsible 

business strategies and investments;

•  discussions led by regional CEOs of operational and 

strategic plans, including identified risks;

•  new brand projects and potential opportunities 
to pursue exclusive partners and adjacencies; 

•  global sales strategies; and

•  analysis of competitor activities.

External insight is obtained where valuable (for example, 
on responsible business strategies).

The Executive Committee also reviews these areas 
frequently, including analysis of specific trends (for 
example, business travel and commercial platforms) 
and has obtained insights on key brand strategies and 
performance and loyalty. The Executive Committee also 
remains focused on regional quality mechanisms to 
support guest experience and how we update standards. 
A global Guest Experience team and programme provides 
oversight of specific initiatives including Luxury & Lifestyle.

The Internal Audit plan also provides independent 
assurance on the execution of key initiatives (including 
loyalty, brand integration and responsible business), guest 
survey data integrity and hotel compliance management.

The Board considers reporting and insight from 
management on:

•  individual and brand category performance and market 

prioritisation strategies;

•  opportunities for new brands, exclusive partners and 
adjacencies and analysis of the competitor landscape;

•  performance of existing exclusive partners and 

commercial agreements; 

•  responsible business strategies and investments;

•  impacts of macro events (including conflicts in the 

Middle East) and impacts on specific markets;

•  performance and prospects for key areas of capital 

investment, including controls over growth decision-
making and post-project reviews of investment 
effectiveness; and

•  external insight where valuable (for example, 

on investor perceptions).

The Executive Committee also reviews these areas 
frequently and obtains reports on loyalty and brand 
performance and initiatives, including implementation 
of owner-facing technology and revenue management 
systems, and specific market strategic considerations.

The Internal Audit plan provides independent assurance 
on initiatives supporting owner returns, for example key 
owner-facing systems, initiatives such as loyalty programme 
enhancement and key processes including talent 
management for Luxury & Lifestyle GMs.

Why these uncertainties are important to the achievement 
of our strategic objectives over the next 2-3 years

How senior management and the Board obtained 
assurance in our risk management and resilience in 2023

Our growth ambitions are dependent on high-quality talent across 
our hotels, reservations offices and corporate functions. We continue 
to face a competitive market and uncertainties in relation to the 
availability, recruitment and retention of sufficient quality, quantity 
and diversity of talent, for example, next-generation hotel GMs to 
support our Luxury & Lifestyle growth and a robust pipeline of 
leadership succession talent.

Our priority to care for our people, communities and planet also 
means that we need to balance short- and longer-term growth 
risks and opportunities with our broader responsibilities and 
commitments. This requires us to enable colleague development 
and growth, to look out for our colleagues’ wellbeing during the 
current cost of living crisis in many locations we operate within, 
and to maintain productivity, collaboration and appropriate labour 
relations. This also necessitates continued adaptation and innovation 
of our operational procedures and remuneration structures to be 
agile to the changing interests of our stakeholders.

IHG has the ability to manage talent and retention risks directly 
in relation to IHG employees but relies on owners and third-party 
suppliers to manage these risks within their businesses. 
Our Procurement, Legal and Risk teams also consider indirect 
workforce risks.

If we do not anticipate and respond appropriately to this 
uncertainty, it could impact our ability to operate and grow hotels, 
the effectiveness and efficiency of our key corporate functions and 
executive leadership, and it could heighten risks of exposure to 
non-compliance or litigation.

By its nature, our business involves the management of large 
volumes of data globally and our stakeholders (including guests, 
loyalty members, colleagues, owners and external authorities) 
expect that this will be done safely and responsibly. 

Our strategic objectives continue to transform how we use our 
commercial and marketing data to improve and personalise the 
customer experience, grow loyalty and empower our owners to 
make better decisions. This involves a roadmap engaging many 
IHG teams in many initiatives, including increasing use of 
cloud-based applications, storage and partnering with third-party 
specialists, as well as exploiting technology advancements and 
innovation, involving the use of personal data and artificial 
intelligence. Our growth strategies, including new business 
partnerships, also increase the complexity of data flows. 

The opportunities presented by this ambition are consciously 
balanced with the inherent exposures our digital footprint 
presents to data, information security and privacy-related threats, 
including threat actors (e.g. criminals, third parties and inherent 
colleague risk), and the need to demonstrate to stakeholders that 
we are using data appropriately. This includes an evolving global 
and local regulatory environment and requirements for localisation 
of data in certain territories. Our ability to deliver our strategies 
confidently is based on investments in recent years in cybersecurity 
and information governance and the maturing of our risk 
management system. 

If we fail to respond to this risk effectively, we face operational, 
financial and reputational impacts to the range of high-value assets 
we are responsible for, or we may miss chances to capitalise on the 
opportunities that effective use of data can bring, including to our 
guests, owners and loyalty members. In addition, if the data we use 
is not accurate, this may impair decision-making and/or lead to lack 
of trust or satisfaction by our guests, loyalty members or owners.

The Board considers reporting and insight from 
management, including on:

•  overall HR and talent strategy;

•  remuneration and incentive strategy and policy, 

including directors and executive management and 
wider structures for all colleagues, supported by 
external advisers;

•  specific talent and succession planning;

•  DE&I updates; and

•  direct employee feedback via the Voice of the 

Employee programme. 

The Executive Committee directly reviews talent 
(both as a group and through individual talent reviews 
with the CEO) and receives regular updates on colleague 
engagement and broader culture and behaviours. The HR 
team also has a dedicated Talent & Leadership steering 
committee. Regular all-employee calls are held with the 
Chief Executive Officer, and there are ongoing leadership 
communications and virtual team meetings at regional 
and functional levels.

The 2023 Internal Audit plan has provided independent 
assurance on employee relations management, 
recruitment of critical GM talent and implementation 
and data integrity checks within a strategic HR 
system transformation.

The Board considers reporting and insight from 
management, including:

•  governance over developments in cross-border data 

transfer arrangements to respond to evolving 
regulation;

•  direct presentations from the Chief Information 

Security Officer, including third-party expertise on risk 
assessments, progress on the information security 
roadmap and advice on specific topics;

•  within the wider roadmap, specific lessons learned and 
initiatives to further enhance security posture following 
the criminal unauthorised system access event in 2022 
and to respond to the ongoing dynamic cybersecurity 
threat environment;

•  information on emerging risks and opportunities of 
generative artificial intelligence, how management 
teams are considering these risks and how they relate 
to the broader assessment of principal risks;

•  updates on the cyber insurance renewal strategy;

•  second-line reporting on our privacy programme and 

policies for handling information responsibly; and

•  updates on metric integrity, including review of ESG 
data principles and future assurance arrangements, 
supported by third-party experts.

The Executive Committee reviews specific areas of digital 
strategy, for example in relation to Greater China, and 
receives briefings from the Chief Information Security 
Officer on emerging risks during the year.

The Internal Audit plan includes independent focus 
on governance of both cybersecurity and data and 
information, assurance on foundational controls at both 
corporate and hotel levels and, for example, in relation to 
data transfers within our loyalty programme, third parties 
and cloud environments.

Why these uncertainties are important to the achievement

How senior management and the Board obtained 
assurance in our risk management and resilience in 2023

As IHG operates in more than 100 countries and continues to 
explore new opportunities for growth, we are continually exposed 
to evolving expectations from our stakeholders in relation to ethical 
and responsible business conduct, extending beyond compliance 
with laws. We are committed to monitoring, reinforcing and 
communicating the continued effectiveness of our human rights 
approach, our social responsibility and environmental performance, 
and recognise that expectations are increasing for us to manage 
and drive ethical and responsible business through our supply 
chains and across our wider business, which involves extensive 
engagement with our franchisees around the world. 

Our stated priority to care for our people, communities and planet 
creates risks and opportunities in relation to our growth ambitions, 
including how we build brands which guests and owners love while 
also considering our wider stakeholder responsibilities, including to 
our colleagues, guests, workers in our supply chains and our local 
communities in a challenging operating environment in many markets. 
We manage these risks carefully so as to operate responsibly and 
with integrity, and to guide decision-making across IHG’s corporate 
and hotel operations.

The Board considers reporting and insight from 
management, including:

•  requests for Board approval of the Code of Conduct, 

the Supplier Code of Conduct, the Communities Policy 
and the Human Rights Policy; 

•  second-line reports on ethics and compliance strategy, 
including external benchmarking where appropriate 
(e.g. Transparency International UK’s Corporate 
Anti-Corruption Benchmark);

•  reports from Internal Audit on confidential reporting 
arrangements and updates from our Voice of the 
Employee programme;

•  updates provided and awareness raising from the 

external Auditor on ESG and climate-related reporting 
and from external specialist advisers; and

•  further second-line function reports on our 
communities, human rights and responsible 
procurement programmes and key disclosures 
including the Modern Slavery Statement.

If we fail to effectively respond to this risk, it has the potential 
to impact our performance and growth in key markets as well 
as cause reputational damage with respect to key stakeholder 
and investor expectations.

Legal and regulatory 
complexity or 
litigation trends

Executive Risk Sponsor: 
Executive Vice President 
General Counsel 
and Company Secretary

Link to strategy:

The global business regulatory and contractual environment 
continues to evolve rapidly, with ongoing legislative changes in 
many jurisdictions that will affect the way in which we operate our 
existing business and where we target growth or digital innovation. 
This includes the nature of our franchise relationships with hotel 
owners, our interactions with our suppliers, and our responsibilities 
to consumers and to colleagues. We consider such exposures 
carefully as part of our decision-making, drawing on an extensive 
network of legal advisers.

These changing laws and regulations continue to add complexity 
and uncertainty to compliance, particularly where there are 
diverging standards between territories (for example, in relation to 
increasing protections and conditions on cross-border data transfer). 
The ongoing use of sanctions and countermeasures as foreign 
policy tools also continues to present operational challenges and 
associated legal and regulatory exposures. 

We recognise that failing to address this risk effectively, and 
non-compliance and/or inadequate compliance, could expose us 
to regulatory breaches, significant monetary and non-monetary 
penalties, adverse litigation and associated reputational harm 
which could impact confidence in the IHG brand and our ability 
to perform in key markets.

The Executive Committee monitors our ambition and 
commitments to our people, communities and planet, 
including the progress of set initiatives and how these 
objectives interrelate to our growth strategy. 

The Internal Audit plan includes independent focus 
on ethics and compliance, including consideration 
of management and external assessments of maturity, 
controls relating to marketing and commercial 
campaigns, due diligence controls and broader 
ESG-related programme governance.

The Board considers reporting and insight from 
management, including on:

•  corporate governance and regulatory developments 
from the General Counsel and the external Auditor;

•  relevant corporate affairs topics, including briefings 

from external advisers;

•  material litigation matters and serious operational safety 

and security incidents and threats;

•  second-line updates on specific regulatory matters, 

including tax, as well as fraud risk management 
controls, supported by external insight and 
benchmarking where appropriate;

•  regional trends within Regional CEO updates; and

•  management strategies to procure appropriate 

insurance coverage, including for casualty, property, 
cyber and directors’ and officers’ liability risks.

The Executive Committee also actively monitors the 
management of key regulatory and/or litigation risks, 
including developments in cross-border data 
transfer regulation.

The Internal Audit plan considers regulatory management 
and provides independent assurance on the 
proportionality of controls: for example, due diligence 
protocols for vendors and owners, third-party guest data 
management and broader contract management.

Why these uncertainties are important to the achievement 
of our strategic objectives over the next 2-3 years

How senior management and the Board obtained 
assurance in our risk management and resilience in 2023

In an increasingly interconnected world, our strategic ambitions 
require us to expand our interdependencies with third parties to 
access capabilities and innovation and to source cost-efficient 
products or services from available markets to support our owners. 
We need to balance these opportunities with early identification 
and resilience planning for anticipated and unanticipated 
emerging risks. 

The Board considers reporting and insight from 
management, including:

•  presentations by second-line functional leaders on 
supply chain risk management to the Responsible 
Business and Audit Committees, including wider 
third-party risk management and internal control 
arrangements; and

Macroeconomic uncertainties, including geopolitical tensions, 
commodity price shifts and labour disputes, continue to impact 
supply chains, which may increase costs and limit availability of 
materials, including to open and operate hotels. Our ability to 
respond to these uncertainties presents both a threat and a 
competitive opportunity, and may occasionally require us to 
consciously expose ourselves to increased risk to secure and 
safeguard supply chains for our owners. 

As we pursue our ambitions as a responsible company, we recognise 
that the regulatory environment continues to evolve, with increasing 
demands for transparency across global supply chains, requiring us 
to scan the horizon for emerging risks to IHG’s objectives. We also 
need to remain vigilant to threats to information security as we work 
with an increasing range of third-party suppliers.

If we fail to effectively address the uncertainties that this risk 
presents, including through closer alignment with our suppliers and 
across supply chains to enhance our resiliency, this may impact the 
design, opening and operation of hotels, the ongoing effectiveness 
of our commercial channels and margins for our owners, as well as 
fees to IHG.

The high growth, fast pace and increasingly complex nature of 
our global business and our growth ambitions exposes us to a 
growing range of inherent operational risks and places ever greater 
importance on the overall resilience of key processes, applications 
and relationships that we depend upon. We aim to avoid harm to, 
and enhance the reputation of, IHG and our brands, and to support 
our people and communities wherever possible. 

We recognise that we need to prepare for predictable and 
unpredictable uncertainties, from macro external to internal 
disruptions. This preparation includes considering fire, life safety 
and security threats including from geopolitical volatility, 
health-related concerns and natural disasters impacting our hotels 
and corporate locations. We need to be able to respond to disruption 
to technology and information security from external threats and 
operational breakdown. We also need to anticipate the potential 
for breakdowns in our financial management and control systems, 
including the risk of fraudulent behaviour, which may be 
heightened in the current challenging economic environment. 

The complexity of our evolving global and regional business model 
and the introduction of different commercial arrangements and 
adjacencies also include inherent uncertainties, for example, in 
relation to our ability to control and influence day-to-day operations 
in our franchised estate, or in our ability to balance ongoing 
robustness of controls while we actively pursue opportunities 
for efficiency. 

Building resilience not only supports IHG’s long-term viability but 
also enables us to take advantage of opportunities to drive growth 
and strengthen returns for our owners. However, if we fail to respond 
effectively to this risk it could impact IHG’s reputation, lead to 
financial loss and claims against IHG and undermine our 
stakeholders’ confidence in our brands. 

•  clarifications of risk management arrangements within 
presentations on new business models and relationships.

The Executive Committee reviews our operational risk 
posture in relation to key digital initiatives, including the 
transformation of hotel technology arrangements, and 
has approved a refreshed Procurement policy during 2023.

The Executive Risk Sponsors receive updates from the 
Chief Procurement Officer on supply chain strategy and 
risks, supported by a Supply Chain Risk Council, which 
draws on external insight where appropriate. 

The Internal Audit plan provides independent review 
of third-party and contract risk management as well as 
control arrangements, for example, relating to technology 
resilience and data governance, and in relation to due 
diligence relating to responsible and ethical 
vendor sourcing.

The Board considers reporting and insight from 
management, including:

•  second-line reporting to the Audit Committee on 
operational safety and security arrangements and 
reported serious incidents and threats;

•  ongoing review of incident handling (including ad hoc 
updates as required and within a broader review of our 
risk management system), describing how management 
teams are coordinating efforts;

•  reports to Audit Committee from the second-line 

financial governance team, including control 
implications for managed hotels and major technology 
and process changes; 

•  an annual review by Risk and Assurance of fraud risk 

management activities; and

•  an independent assurance by PwC of SOC1 control 
reports provided for the benefit of hotel owners.

The Executive Committee is closely involved with 
emerging incidents to consider the appropriateness of 
management action plans to deal with disruption. There is 
also an established Financial Control Steering Committee, 
which brings together various functions and discusses 
risks to financial controls, including fraud risk management.

Internal Audit provided an independent review of key 
functional resilience capabilities, including scenario 
planning, third-party technology resilience and reports 
on the governance of service organisation controls.

or indirectly), and to respond to ever-changing stakeholder needs 
and preferences, which may evolve rapidly in an environment of 
macroeconomic uncertainty and significant cost and 
labour pressures. 

This context will require us to generate value by defining and 
implementing new technology-based products or services or by 
approaching existing products, services or processes in new ways 
that generate revenue or reduce costs for our owners. We will need 
to maintain the right balance between disruptive, sustaining and 
incremental innovation and, in doing this, we will often consciously 
expose ourselves to uncertainty. 

We are pursuing a high paced, multi-year roadmap of significant 
investments to enhance the performance of our technology, 
developing our own talent and working with a wide range of 
suppliers, partners and academic institutions to leverage their 
insights, while the pace of innovation and competition in digital 
behaviours in the hospitality industry and wider society continues 
to accelerate rapidly. This involves leveraging Generative AI to 
improve guest experiences, generate personalised marketing, 
expand analytics capabilities and improve effectiveness and 
efficiency, including in-hotel operations.

If we fail to address this risk, we may not capitalise on opportunities 
to maintain or increase guest and owner preferences for IHG and its 
brands and/or reduce our resilience on ageing channel management 
and technology platforms (including those of third parties, on 
which we rely directly or indirectly). 

As a global business with a portfolio of brands in over 100 countries, 
IHG faces fast-evolving stakeholder expectations and uncertainties 
relating to our ability to continue to operate and grow in an 
environment impacted by physical and transition risks relating 
to climate change. 

Our business model means that we share these threats and 
opportunities with our owners, including our dependency on their 
capacity to invest in the short- and long term. We will continue to 
set ambitious targets, to assess the aggregate impact of climate 
change and to capitalise on opportunities that the low-carbon 
transition will bring for the hospitality industry by responding to 
evolving guest and colleague preferences. 

Our TCFD assessment considers both physical and transition risks 
to IHG, and we will continue to assess the aggregate impact of 
climate change on our wider stakeholders including our third-party 
hotel owners.

The potential impact of climate change-related uncertainties is 
evaluated as an integral part of other principal risks; however, if we 
fail to react to physical and transition risks effectively overall, then 
this has the potential to impact IHG’s reputation, performance and 
growth in key markets. Our management of these risks is also 
subject to scrutiny from a wide range of stakeholders, including 
regulators and investor groups, corporate clients, guests 
and colleagues.

The Board considers reporting and insight from 
management, including on:

•  our China digital strategy and the integration of our 
commercial and technology platforms within our 
Iberostar Beachfront Resorts partnership;

•  options for technology to support more effective and 
efficient collation of ESG data across our global estate;

•  budget allocation, including funding of key technology 
products and post-project reviews by finance teams of 
major capital investments; and

•  information security strategy and risk profile.

The Executive Committee considers the pace of innovation 
and delivery of key technology initiatives relating to mobile, 
loyalty and booking transformation and hotel technology. 
This involves identifying critical enablers and prioritising 
investments. The Global Marketing and Commercial & 
Technology teams coordinate a joint technology roadmap, 
and a dedicated Generative AI steering committee monitors 
opportunities across various IHG processes and teams.

The 2023 Internal Audit plan included focus on 
programme governance and the effectiveness of controls 
over expenditure and benefit delivery for various critical 
functional and guest and owner-facing technology 
initiatives. This has provided independent assurance in 
relation to overall programme management, tracking and 
financial governance controls, and delivery of initiatives 
at high pace across the hotel estate and within the loyalty 
transformation programme. The team also continues to 
support and advise several programme teams in real time, 
including on HR system changes.

The Board considers reporting and insight from 
management, including:

•  reporting from corporate responsibility on TCFD 

disclosures and the embedding of climate considerations 
into strategy, governance, risk management and 
performance management, supported by external 
subject matter expertise; and

•  updates from various second-line teams on approaches 

to ESG data disclosure and future strategies for 
assurance (including to comply with changing 
regulatory requirements).

The CEO, CFO, General Counsel and EVP Global Corporate 
Affairs have executive oversight of our TCFD reporting 
and the embedding of climate considerations into our 
wider business growth strategy. Oversight of the Journey 
to Tomorrow programme is provided by the Executive 
Responsible Business Governance Committee.

The Head of Internal Audit supports the TCFD programme 
efforts, including advising on the approach to data 
collection and data assurance. This group is also advised 
by external experts. Internal Audit has also reviewed 
broader ESG programme governance.

Viability statement

Trading in 2023 remained strong, 

with RevPAR and profitability 
exceeding pre-pandemic highs. 

Our efficient operating model resulted in 
Group adjusted free cash flowa of $819m 
during 2023 and net debta increased by 
$421m, after $1,035m of ordinary dividends 
and the share buyback. The Group’s 
business model is discussed in more 
detail on pages 10 to 13.

Looking forward, the Directors have 
determined that the three-year period to 
31 December 2026 is an appropriate period 
to be covered by the viability statement. 
The Group’s annual financial planning process 
builds a three-year plan. This detailed plan 
takes into consideration the principal risks, 
the Group’s strategy and current and 
emerging market conditions. The plan then 
forms the basis for strategic actions taken 
across the business and is used as the 
basis for longer-range planning. The plan 
is reviewed annually by the Directors. 
Once approved, the plan is then cascaded 
to the business and used to set performance 
metrics and objectives. Performance against 
those metrics and objectives is regularly 
reviewed by the Directors. 

Principal risks 
The relative strength and resilience of the 
IHG business model to severe shocks has 
been proven by performance through the 
Covid-19 pandemic, with positive cash flows 
being generated through one of the most 
challenging periods of trading in the history 
of the industry. In assessing the viability of 
the Group, the Directors have considered 
the impact of the principal risks as outlined 
on pages 42 to 49. The discussion on those 
pages includes a description of why these 
risks are important to the achievement of 
our objectives and how the Group manages 
these risks.

We have considered which principal risks 
could have the most significant and direct 
impact to the viability of the Group during 
the three-year period of assessment and 
they are shown below, alongside the 
scenario that is used to model those risks. 

There are a range of possible planning 
scenarios over the three-year period 
considered in this review due to macro 
uncertainties and geopolitical risks affecting 
markets in each of our regions. In the US and 
Europe, an uncertain trajectory for interest 
rates and inflation links to concerns over the 
strength of consumer spending and broader 
economic growth and potential impact on 
travel demand. In Greater China, challenges 
in the property sector means it is more 
difficult to accurately predict the pace of 
further recovery of domestic demand and 
also international travel of Chinese consumers. 
In assessing the viability of the Group, the 
Directors have reviewed a number of 
scenarios, weighting downside risks that 
would threaten the business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity of the 
Group more heavily than opportunities. 

Viability scenarios and assumptions
In performing the viability analysis, 
the Directors have considered a ‘Base 
Case’ which assumes global RevPAR in 
2024 to 2026 continues to grow in line 
with market expectations in each of 
our regions. The assumptions applied 
in the viability assessment are 
consistent with those used for Group 
planning purposes, the going concern 
assessment, for impairment testing 
and for reviewing recoverability of 
deferred tax assets (see further detail 
on page 161).

The Directors have also reviewed a 
‘Severe Downside Case’ which is based 
on a severe but plausible scenario 
equivalent to the market conditions 
experienced through the 2008-09 
global financial crisis. This assumes 
that the performance during 2024 
starts to worsen and then RevPAR 
decreases significantly by 17% in 2025 
and increases by 5% in 2026.

Viability assessment 
At 31 December 2023 the Group had cash 
and cash equivalents of $1,322m plus an 
undrawn bank facility of $1,350m.

Under the Base Case and Severe 
Downside Case the Group is forecast to 
generate positive free cash flow over the 
2024-26 period and the bank facility is 
undrawn. The principal risks that could 
be applicable have been considered and 
are able to be absorbed within the 
covenant requirements. 

Under the Severe Downside scenario, 
there is also headroom to the covenants 
over the 2024-26 period to absorb 
multiple additional risks; for example, 
additional RevPAR impacts and a 
widespread cybersecurity incident. 
The bank facility would remain undrawn. 

The Directors reviewed a number of 
actions that could be taken if required 
to reduce discretionary spend, creating 
substantial additional headroom to 
the covenants. 

The Directors reviewed a reverse stress 
test scenario to determine what decrease 
in RevPAR would create a breach of the 
covenants and the cash reserves that 
would be available to the Group at that 
time. The Directors concluded that it 
was very unlikely that a single risk or 
combination of the risks considered 
could create the sustained RevPAR 
impact required to breach the covenants, 
except for a significant global event. 

None of the scenarios modelled indicates 
that a covenant amendment would be 
required but, in the event that it was, 
the Directors believe it is reasonable to 
expect that such an amendment could 
be obtained based on experience of 
negotiating the waivers and amendments 
during 2020. The Group also has 
alternative options to manage this risk, 
including raising additional funding in 
the capital markets. We continue to plan 
to maintain an investment-grade credit 
rating which provides good access to the 
debt capital markets.

  See also our business model on pages 10 to 13, 
the going concern assessment on page 161, 
and the impact of the principal risks on 
pages 42 to 49.

Conclusion
The Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over the three-year period to 
31 December 2026, taking account of the 
Group’s current position, the Group’s 
strategy and the principal risks documented 
in the Strategic Report. Based on this 
assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to 
31 December 2026.

We have considered the potential impact 
of the severe downside scenario on our net 
system size growth. We do not believe a 
change in system size growth would have 
a material impact on the Group during the 
period under review. 

We have also considered the principal risks 
that may impact the viability of the Group 
over a longer period; for example, the impact 
of climate change on hospitality. The physical 
and transition climate risks to which IHG is 
most exposed are discussed in the TCFD 
statement on pages 52 to 59. Physical risks 
are not considered material to the long-term 
viability of the Group, and transition risks 
present both opportunities and risks. Whilst 
some transition risks have been assessed as 
being potentially material to the Group over 
the next one to five years under a 1.5°C 
scenario, this scenario is not considered 
a likely outcome leading to the probability 
of a material impact on the Group’s viability 
assessment through 31 December 2026 
as low.

Funding
The Group’s $1,350m revolving credit facility 
was extended by one year in 2023 and now 
matures in 2028 (‘the bank facility’). 

There are two financial covenants in the 
bank facility – interest cover and leverage 
ratio. The interest cover covenant requires 
a ratio of Covenant EBITDA to Covenant 
interest payable above 3.5:1 and the leverage 
ratio requires Covenant net debt to Covenant 
EBITDA below 4.0:1. In the event a covenant 
test was failed whilst the bank facility was 
undrawn, the facility could be cancelled by 
the lenders but would not trigger a repayment 
demand on the bonds which threatened the 
viability of the Group. See note 24 in the 
Group Financial Statements for further details. 

In November 2023 the Group issued a six-year 
€600m bond. During the assessment period 
there is a €500m bond maturing in October 
2024, a £300m bond maturing in August 
2025 and a £350m maturity in August 2026. 
It has been assumed that the bond maturing 
in 2024 will be repaid from cash reserves 
and the 2025 and 2026 bonds will be 
refinanced up to one year before maturity.

Executive Committee, with execution at the 
operational level overseen by the TCFD 
Steering Committee and the Regional 
Decarbonisation Steering Committees 
(see diagram below).

The TCFD Steering Committee has 
responsibilities for identifying and reviewing 
potential impacts of climate-related risks and 
opportunities, measuring their impact and 
integrating climate scenario analysis into our 
business strategy. We introduced Regional 
Steering Committees in 2023 to oversee 
development as well as implementation 
of regional decarbonisation strategies, 
reflecting the need for approaches tailored 
to different geographies. 

The Chief Sustainability Officer is responsible 
for monitoring progress against our carbon

the Responsible Business Committee.

Stakeholder engagement 
The relationships we build with our 
stakeholders are critical to informing our 
business decisions and delivering on our 
purpose of providing True Hospitality for 
Good. Understanding and balancing the 
interests of our stakeholders is intrinsic to 
good governance. It provides a foundation 
against which we measure ourselves, to 
protect our reputation and develop our 
commercial and social awareness. 

To guide our work and ensure that we can 
plan and prioritise our impact, we regularly 
conduct materiality assessments of ESG 
issues, which helps us to focus on issues 
that are the most relevant to society, our 
industry and the long-term success of IHG.

  See pages 36 and 37 for our approach 
to stakeholder engagement. 

  See pages 13 to 15 of our 2023 Responsible 
Business Report for more details of our 
materiality assessment and climate-related 
stakeholder engagement.

Strategy 

The Executive Committee and Board 
regularly assess the impact of climate 
change on IHG within their decision-making 
processes. It is acknowledged not only as 
one of our 10 principal risks but also as an 
integral component of our business strategy, 
aligning with our fourth strategic priority, 
‘Care for our people, communities 
and planet’.

We address climate-related risks through 
this priority and our Journey to Tomorrow 
programme, which includes critical elements 
relating to carbon and energy that form the 
basis of our transition plan. 

This section describes our key climate-
related risks and opportunities, their potential 
impact on our business, and its resilience 
to such impacts, which has been assessed 
using scenario analysis. 

  See page 19 for an overview of IHG’s four 
strategic priorities, including ‘Care for our 
people, communities and planet’.

Identifying and assessing IHG’s 
climate-related risks and opportunities 
While our principal risks outline uncertainties 
that might threaten the ability to achieve 
our objectives throughout our business plan, 
climate change has the potential to impact 
IHG’s prospects over a range of future 
temperature scenarios and time horizons. 

With the support of external experts, 
we have undertaken scenario analysis to 
identify and assess which climate-related 
risks and opportunities are most relevant 
and potentially impactful for IHG over the 
short, medium and long term. Our analysis 
focused on the assessment of both 
transition and physical climate change 
uncertainties across all hotels in our three 
regions (Americas, EMEAA and Greater 
China) under three different temperature 
scenarios and timeframes, as outlined in 
the adjacent tables. 

Our climate scenario analysis identifies 
risks as having a ‘potential impact’ on IHG 
if they could directly impact revenue, 
costs or IHG’s reputation without mitigation. 
Our qualitative assessment of climate 
impacts on IHG’s financial performance 
considered future revenue growth from 
our 10-year business plan and aligns with 
long-term market growth rates projected 
to 2050. 

While scenario analysis is not designed to 
deliver precise forecasts, we are actively 
enhancing and refining our data and 
assumptions to evolve the transparency 
of our TCFD disclosure to cover both 
quantitative and qualitative impacts in 
future. We will look to determine the 
materiality of climate-related risks and 
opportunities following the same criteria 
used to determine the significance of 
other information in our financial filings.

  See the forward-looking statement 
on page 263.

Our initial analysis was conducted during 
a period of pronounced variability in the 
recovery of the hospitality industry following 
the Covid-19 pandemic. This situation led 
to limited visibility in forecasting. Our 
assessment is now based on an assumption 
of reduced volatility in the medium- and 
longer-term outlook.

We prioritise climate-related uncertainties 
that we feel could be most significant to 
IHG and our stakeholders, building our 
business’s resilience to climate change by 
embedding operational decision-making 
and business processes that appropriately 
consider and address climate-related risks. 
Since our 2022 report, we have evolved 
the framing of our identified climate-related 
risks and opportunities to consider potential 
qualitative impacts across all relevant risk 
categories. We have also begun to assess 
chronic physical risks in addition to acute 

ones, and we will review how these and the 
wider impacts considered on pages 55 and 
56 can be factored into future quantification. 

continue to evolve, and these will be 
assessed against the Group’s judgements 
and estimates.

Determining the significance of climate-
related risks and opportunities to IHG 
In preparing our 2023 Annual Report, the 
potential impacts of climate change have 
been considered. There are no climate-
related estimates and assumptions that have 
a material impact on asset values in the 
Group Financial Statements (see page 172). 
While there is currently no material medium-
term impact expected from climate change, 
the risks attached to climate change 

We acknowledge the interconnectedness 
of the specific risks outlined on pages 55 
and 56 and the overarching risk posed by 
climate change to both our hotel owners 
and IHG. The cumulative impact of climate-
related risks has the potential to influence 
the overall appeal of investments in the 
industry at a broader scale. In the future, 
we will assess the aggregate impact on 
our wider stakeholders, including our 
hotel owners.

Stronger policy action 
The world takes immediate 
and substantial action to 
reduce GHG emissions in line 
with the UN Paris Agreement, 
with higher use of renewable 
energy and widespread 
carbon capture and systematic 
change, influenced by policies 
such as carbon taxes. Lower 
likelihood of significant acute 
and chronic physical 
climate risks.

Lower policy action
The world takes limited to 
no action to reduce GHG 
emissions, with continued high 
use of fossil fuels. Increased 
likelihood and intensity of 
significant acute and chronic 
physical climate risks.

Climate risk time horizons  How IHG defines/reasoning

Short  
(1–5 years)

Medium  
(6–15 years)

Long  
(16–30 years)

Our short-term time horizon incorporates our financial going concern 
and viability statement assessments, along with our budget-setting 
timeline. Our hotel energy performance targets are also aligned to 
this timeframe. 

Our medium-term time horizon reflects our 10-year responsible 
business plan, Journey to Tomorrow, and our climate-related targets. 
It also reflects our time horizon from a strategic planning perspective. 

A long-term time horizon of up to 30 years aligns with national 
government policy and regulatory timeframes: for example, the UK’s 
2050 net-zero target and the Paris Agreement. It also reflects the 
longer-term nature of the contracts we sign with our owners. 

a  To assess potential physical impacts, we have aligned the temperature rise scenarios in our analysis with the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C aligned Representative Concentration 
Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. 

b  To assess potential transition impacts, we have based our analysis on the International Institute for Applied Systems 

Analysis’ (IIASA) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to capture how societal, economic and technological trends 
could evolve over time and under three selected temperature rise scenarios.

and all other IHG stakeholders. We can 
enhance the IHG Hotels & Resorts 
masterbrand by reducing our environmental 

impact and supporting our hotel owners 
to manage increasing operational costs, 
secure supply chains and reduce exposure 
to increasing climate risks, regulation 
and taxes.

Summary of IHG’s most significant climate-related risks and opportunities 

Risk/opportunity descriptiona

Unmitigated potential risks and opportunities

IHG’s risk management and strategic response 
to build business resilience

Transition risks and opportunitiesb

IHG’s ability to decarbonise in line 
with stakeholder expectations

Potential short term (1-5 years) 
impact under a 1.5°C scenario, 
if unmitigated

Our key stakeholders have 
increasing expectations for 
businesses to influence positive 
change and deliver on their 
environmental commitments. 
This includes increasing 
questions from corporate clients 
and regulatory intervention 
by governments.

Decarbonising our business in 
line with expectations presents 
a potential opportunity for IHG to 
enhance its brand, by supporting 
owners to decarbonise and 
capture a greater share of guests 
seeking more sustainable hotels. 
Failure to meet expectations could 
cause reputational damage. 

Reputational: 
In scenarios projecting global temperature increases of 1.5°C, 
2°C and 4°C, our analysis showed a potential reputational 
impact of IHG not decarbonising in line with stakeholder 
expectations in the short-term, if unmitigated. Under a 1.5°C 
scenario, this impact would remain a potential impact in the 
medium to long term if IHG fell further behind competitors 
and peers in meeting its carbon target. Alternatively, IHG may 
outperform peers and enhance the sustainable reputation 
of the IHG brand. Under a 4°C scenario, the longer-term 
reputational risk will be lower as most companies and 
governments will fail to meet their own targets. 

Market: 
If investors’ expectations for businesses to demonstrate 
a shift towards low-carbon increase, this may influence 
decision-making and disadvantage companies unable to 
evidence sufficient progress and advantage those that are. 

Should the expectations of hotel owners not align with IHG’s 
decarbonisation plans, potential challenges and conflicts may 
arise that inhibit IHG’s ability to influence and deliver on its 
commitments.

Policy and legal: 
The speed at which governments align their policies and plans 
to their climate change commitments will impact the rate at 
which IHG can decarbonise. 

Changing consumer preferences 
towards sustainable travel

Potential short term (1-5 years) 
impact under a 1.5°C scenario, 
if unmitigated

Increasing appetite to travel 
sustainably could have a direct 
positive or negative impact on 
IHG’s financial performance, 
depending on IHG’s response 
and ability to adapt to changing 
consumer preferences for 
sustainable travel.

Market: 
Under 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C scenarios, our analysis identified a 
potential financial impact in the short-term. This impact could 
be negative if IHG fails to adapt to a potential shift in customer 
demand favouring sustainable stays. Alternatively, IHG could 
capitalise on this trend and secure a substantial share of the 
growing market. 

We continue to receive sustainability-related questions 
from corporate customers, particularly when they seek 
accommodation providers that can support them with their 
own ESG ambitions. To enhance our understanding of this risk, 
we monitor ESG-related questions from corporate customers 
submitting Requests For Proposals (RFPs). In 2023, we saw 
more than 70% of customer accounts include ESG questions 
in RFPs, including requests for environmental data about 
our hotels. We have also conducted an internal analysis and 
found that nearly all top strategic global customers’ accounts 
have their own carbon targets.

Our work on decarbonisation supports our 
overarching corporate aim of ‘Care for our people, 
communities and planet’ – one of IHG’s four strategic 
priorities. Our decarbonisation strategy and 
Transition Plan can be found on page 57. 

  See details of the actions we are taking to 
make progress towards our commitment and 
to maximise the opportunities associated with 
decarbonising in our Responsible Business Report 
on pages 28 to 32. 

The dependencies associated with our decarbonisation 
strategy are outlined on page 58 and the metrics and 
targets we have developed to measure this risk are 
detailed on page 59. 

Additionally, our approach to stakeholder engagement 
supports the management of this potential risk or 
opportunity. This includes developing partnerships 
and working with governments, trade associations 
and industry peers to influence policy positively 
and to present opportunities for IHG hotel owners 
to decarbonise. 

  See more on our stakeholder engagement relating 
to climate change on pages 13 to 15 of our 2023 
Responsible Business Report.

  See IHG’s business strategy on pages 18 to 35.

  See page 58 for further details on the key external 
factors that influence IHG’s decarbonisation. 

We support our hotels in reducing the impact of 
their operations and improving their sustainable 
credentials through the provision of training, tools, 
and resources, as well as cross-industry collaboration 
and partnerships that enable hotels to innovate. 

Whether our guests are travelling for business 
or leisure, we see a real opportunity to help them 
have a more sustainable stay as part of the IHG 
guest experience. In 2023, we continued to promote 
our Greener Stay initiative, as well as facilitating 
hotels’ access to leading third-party sustainability 
certification programmes and launching IHG’s 
Meeting for Good sustainable meetings programme, 
which helps hotels to respond to the growing demand 
for sustainable meeting offerings, post-pandemic.

See last year’s Annual Report for previous wording.

b  In our 2022 Annual Report, we identified a decline in aviation as a priority transition risk, however, external forecasts show that aviation is set to increase in the future and leisure and 
business travel has returned to pre-Covid-19 levels. As a result, we have transferred this risk from one that we actively mitigate and report on, to monitoring as part of our sustainable 
travel risk.

Risk/opportunity descriptiona

Unmitigated potential risks and opportunities

IHG’s risk management and strategic response 
to build business resilience

Physical risks – acute and chronic

Increased frequency and severity 
of extreme weather events

Potential long term (13-30 years) 
impact under a 2°C and 4°C 
scenario, if unmitigated

Rising temperatures and in turn 
increasing likelihood and severity 
of acute or extreme weather 
events creates an inherent risk of 
disruption to IHG hotel operations. 
Such disruptions could impact 
revenues and the fee income 
received by IHG, potentially 
diminishing the appeal of the 
hotel industry to owners in 
specific locations. 

IHG also faces potential 
reputational consequences if 
it fails to effectively respond to 
extreme events and provide 
appropriate support to owners 
and affected communities.

Significant changes in long-term 
weather patterns

Impact to be determined

As temperatures rise, chronic 
physical risks are expected to 
intensify. Responding to these risks 
may lead to heightened operating 
costs for hotel owners, alterations 
in customer travel patterns and 
impacts on hotel resource 
availability due to population 
migration and supply chain 
disruption. These may impact 
IHG’s financial performance and 
ability to grow in certain markets.

Under 2°C and 4°C temperature scenarios, our initial analysis 
found that acute physical risks could have a potential financial 
impact to IHG, if unmitigated. However, our tracking of the 
current impact of natural disasters on IHG’s revenue has shown 
this is not the case. To date, our asset-light franchise business 
model and geographical spread have helped to protect IHG’s 
revenue exposure. 

However, we recognise the need to support our hotel teams, 
guests and the communities in which we operate, and in 2023, 
we conducted additional analysis on acute physical risks at the 
hotel level to assess our existing and pipeline hotels’ current 
and future exposure to 2030 and 2050. 

Analysis found the most prominent risks, where we have a 
significant hotel presence, to be drought risk in countries such 
as the US, UAE and Saudi Arabia, and severe storms, tropical 
storms and cyclones in countries such as the US, China, 
Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. Countries with the overall 
highest exposure to acute risks included China, the Caribbean 
nations, the Philippines and Oman. Acute risks are shown to 
increase over time, with significant increases in heatwave 
duration and drought length by 2050 across our existing and 
pipeline hotel locations.

In 2023, we conducted analysis with third-party experts to 
identify geographical locations with high chronic physical risk. 
This analysis found that IHG’s hotel locations are more exposed 
to long-term persistent chronic climate risks than to short-term 
acute shocks, and has therefore informed our decision to 
transition chronic physical risks from an uncertainty that we 
monitor to one that we report on and begin to actively manage.

The existing risks found to be most prominent are heat stress in 
countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, UAE, China and 
India and water stress in the US, China, Australia, Mexico, India 
and Saudi Arabia. Extreme temperature, heatwave duration and 
heavy rainfall are also expected to rise significantly under 4°C 
scenario (RCP 8.5) to 2030 and 2050. 

Our focus has been on the identification and 
mapping of our acute physical risks, understanding 
and monitoring the impact on hotels, and assessing 
whether this is significant for IHG at the Group level. 
We are refining our understanding of this risk by 
continuing to develop our financial modelling. 
The analysis conducted in 2023, focusing on the 
physical risk at both existing and pipeline hotel, will 
help us identify the hotels most exposed. We will take 
into account their climate adaptive capacity and 
support hotels in developing mitigation strategies 
where needed.

We will also use our analysis to further integrate 
physical climate risks into our business decision-
making processes and will explore where IHG 
mitigation and adaptation strategies might be needed.

At present, we provide support to our hotels and 
surrounding communities following natural disasters 
through our humanitarian aid partners, as well as 
through access to IHG colleague assistance funds 
and natural disaster guides.

  See page 26 of our 2023 Responsible Business 
Report for the disaster response support we 
provide to hotels and our partners.

IHG will conduct scenario analysis to consider the 
potential impact of the chronic risks identified to 
IHG’s financial prospects and performance and seek 
to update business decision-making processes to 
consider physical climate risks, where needed.

We will establish which hotels are most exposed, with 
consideration to the local infrastructure and individual 
hotels’ capacity to adapt, as well as understanding 
how hotels are currently being affected by changing 
weather and what support we can provide 
moving forward. 

  See pages 37 and 38 of our 2023 Responsible 
Business Report for more detail on our Journey 
to Tomorrow water commitments and 
performance monitoring.

a  The terminology used for our climate uncertainties has been adjusted to better align with IHG’s risk management framework: however, the scenario analysis remains unchanged. 

See last year’s Annual Report for previous wording.

b  In our 2022 Annual Report, we identified a decline in aviation as a priority transition risk, however, external forecasts show that aviation is set to increase in the future and leisure and 
business travel has returned strongly to pre-Covid-19 levels. As a result, we have transferred this risk from one that we actively mitigate and report on, to monitoring as part of our 
sustainable travel risk.

Transition plan

We are targeting a 46% absolute reduction 
in our GHG emissions by 2030 from a 2019 
base year (Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 
Scope 3 from fuel and energy-related 
activities and franchised hotels energy). 
The SBTi has validated this target, confirming 
its alignment with climate science and the 
Paris Agreement. This validation ensures that 
the target is designed to prevent the worst 
impacts of climate change.

Our decarbonisation strategy has a strong 
governance structure to support our 
progress towards our ambitions. Regional 
Steering Committees now help to account 
for geographical differences and are 
responsible for developing and executing 
regional decarbonisation plans which target 
actions that are most impactful within each 

region, alongside resource requirements. 
Refer to page 53 for our climate 
governance structure.

  See pages 28 to 32 of our 2023 Responsible 
Business Report for more details on the 
decarbonisation actions we are taking to 
deliver our transition plan.

IHG values the Transition Plan Taskforce’s 
(TPT) guidance on best practice reporting, 
and actively participated in the consultation 
period as members of the TPT Sandbox 
coalition. While awaiting additional sectoral 
guidance and updates to the regulatory 
framework, we will work towards alignment 
with the TPT framework. 

We will also look at how we might align our 
future biodiversity and natural capital work 
with the Taskforce for Nature Related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD) to enhance

How we plan to drive towards our 
2030 SBT
To make progress towards our 
decarbonisation target while continuing 
to grow our business, we are acting across 
three principal levers: decarbonising our 
existing hotels; supporting our hotels to 
access renewable energy; and developing 
new-build hotels that operate at very low/
zero carbon. 

Our decarbonisation model enables 
us to analyse various scenarios of grid 
decarbonisation, energy conservation 
measure implementation and renewable 
procurement across different periods, 
geographies and hotel archetypes. Estimated 
emission reduction potential, costs and return 
on investment (ROI) for energy reduction 
initiatives guides decarbonisation efforts. Our 
modelling also incorporates projected growth 
across our portfolio in our decarbonisation 

estimates, incorporating our long-range 
plan for system size growth to 2030. 

Our plan does not include the use of carbon 
offsets. Instead, we are focused on the 
absolute reduction of emissions, aligned 
with SBTi guidance. Our carbon footprint 
is reported as one of IHG’s KPIs (see page 63). 
Our transition plan (below) outlines our 
actions across each of our decarbonisation 
levers over the short and medium term.

Transition plan dependencies 
Given IHG has a predominantly asset-light 
business model, with the majority of hotels 
owned by third parties, we’re working 
closely with our owners and teams across 
our entire estate in relation to our 
climate targets. 

reduction programmes. While we can 
provide guidelines and support, the 
decentralised nature of the franchise 
system requires a collaborative approach, 
incentivisation and effective communication 
to drive sustainability initiatives across the 
entire network. 

Unlike company-owned properties, 
franchised and managed hotels have 
independent ownership, including decisions 
related to infrastructure, utilities and carbon 

There are a number of additional external 
factors that impact the rate at which IHG 
hotel owners can decarbonise. Some of 
these key external dependencies are 

outlined below, and the impacts of these 
dependencies are considered in how we 
progress towards our SBT. 

We recognise that our role in collaborating 
with governments, peers and trade bodies 
will be crucial to supporting owners and the 
industry in decarbonising successfully. 

  See further details of how we engage with 
stakeholders on pages 13 to 15 of our 2023 
Responsible Business Report.

Description

Response

Further government financial incentives are needed to encourage and support hotel owners to drive efficiency measures

  See pages 13 to 15 of 
our 2023 Responsible 
Business Report for 
our stakeholder 
engagement and 
pages 28 to 32 for our 
carbon and energy 
reduction progress.

  See page 31 of our 
2023 Responsible 
Business Report for 
progress on sourcing 
renewable energy.

The combination of high capital investment costs and longer payback periods for many ECMs is a barrier to 
reducing hotel energy consumption. Further government financial incentives (for example, tax relief) would 
support IHG hotel owners to prioritise the investment needed to improve the efficiency of their hotels and 
therefore drive accelerated decarbonisation across hotels operating under IHG brands.

Ability of our third-party owned hotels to move away from fossil fuel use is dependent on several factors

IHG predominantly franchises and manages hotels in more than 100 countries around the world, including 
many where electricity grids are heavily dependent on fossil fuels. In 2023, managed and franchised hotels 
consumed over 8 million MWh of electricity, which equates to 76% of our total reported GHG emissions. 
We anticipate this electricity percentage to grow as hotel owners look to electrify their hotels to reduce their 
reliance on fossil fuels. In order for these actions to translate into meaningfully lower carbon emissions, 
there are several inter-related dependencies:

Electricity grids decarbonising in line with the Paris Agreement 
We are reliant on governments implementing policies and plans that decarbonise electricity grids in line 
with a 1.5°C trajectory. Government inaction in this area would significantly impact IHG’s ability to meet 
its targets.

Owners’ ability to access scalable, cost-effective renewable energy 
A crucial element of our transition plan is to support our franchised and managed hotels (which bear the 
costs of energy) to access renewable energy at scale. While IHG can influence renewable energy adoption, 
for example, by negotiating renewable energy tariffs or setting up contracts with approved suppliers for our 
community solar programme, we have a limited ability to enforce adoption. Large-scale solutions such as 
virtual Power Purchase Agreements (vPPAs) present unknown long-term financial exposure for IHG due to 
market price uncertainty, while potential changes to GHG accounting of renewable energy creates further 
barriers to adoption.

Additionally, the geographic spread of our hotel portfolio means that by 2030, over half of our emissions 
will be from regulated energy markets such as China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. IHG is therefore dependent 
on those markets deregulating and the availability of solutions to enable cost-effective renewable energy 
to be procured at scale. 

The business case for switching from gas to electricity needs to become more financially compelling 
for hotel owners 
The price disparity between electricity and gas (in Western and Middle Eastern markets) presents a 
significant challenge to transitioning energy use to renewable sources. Rebalancing of electricity and gas 
prices would improve the rate of decarbonisation that could be achieved by hotel electrification.

Decarbonisation is heavily reliant on a sustained change in mindset and behaviour in day-to-day operations by hotel owners, teams 
and guests

Meeting our SBT requires new operational behaviours and mindset shifts to adapt to low-energy products 
and services. Guests’ expectations will need to evolve to align with more sustainable practices: for example, 
electrification will require a move away from speciality cooking techniques associated with fossil-fuel-based 
cooking, such as gas or charcoal – an industry-wide consideration. In addition, operational efficiencies can 
significantly reduce energy consumption at a hotel level; however, in an environment of high employee 
turnover across the hospitality industry, ongoing training and industry-wide initiatives are required to 
embed and sustain new practices. 

  See page 31 of our 
2023 Responsible 
Business Report for 
progress on sourcing 
renewable energy.

Risk management 

Identification, assessment, management 
and integration of climate-related risks
At IHG, we assess the connections between 
climate-related risks and opportunities and 
other key principal risks to ensure climate 
change is embedded in our risk management 
processes and addressed through our 
business strategy. We consider climate 
change to be a major uncertainty affecting 
our industry, reflecting this as a principal risk 
and indicating that it may affect other core 
areas of our business, including guest and 
owner preference for our brands. Our 
business model means that we share threats 
and opportunities with our owners, including 
our dependency on their capacity to invest, 
uphold our brand standards and achieve 
our commitments. 

The Audit Committee provides oversight of 
the effectiveness of IHG’s risk management 
and internal control processes, including 
those relating to climate. To enable our risks 
to inform business decisions effectively, 
our risk reviews are conducted by the Board, 
Executive Committee and management 
teams to align with the business decision-
making cycle. Our Risk and Assurance team 
conducts regular meetings with IHG leaders 
and teams responsible for assessing and 
managing risks. These conversations consider 
a range of uncertainties, such as the effect 
of climate change on hospitality, and the 
steps being taken to reduce IHG’s exposure, 
which may be relevant to the delivery of 
teams’ objectives and IHG’s success.

Enhancing awareness and improving 
understanding of IHG’s principal risks 
across the business, particularly around 
the complexities of climate change, helps 
ensure the consideration of risk factors 
within decision-making. IHG’s Corporate 
Responsibility team has developed climate 
training and tools for our corporate and 
hotel colleagues, and conducts regular 
workshops with key business functions to 
engage them on our decarbonisation and 
our Journey to Tomorrow programme. 

   Refer to pages 42 to 49 for more information on 
our approach to risk governance, management 
and IHG’s principal risks. 

   See pages 55 to 56 for information on our most 
significant climate-related risks and 
opportunities. 

   See page 32 of our 2023 Responsible Business 
Report for information on climate training, 
tools and resources.

Metrics and targets 

To help us manage our climate-related risks 
and opportunities, we are developing 
metrics and targets in line with TCFD 
recommended disclosures. Where metrics 
and targets are still in progress or we do not 
consider the category to be relevant to IHG, 
we have provided details below.

GHG emissions and progress against SBT 
Our GHG emissions are measured by our 
performance against our SBT commitment 
to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 
Scope 3 emissions from our franchised 
estate energy and FERA by 46% by 2030, 
from a 2019 base year. Our target is 
approved by the SBTi and our methodology 
to calculate our GHG emissions follows the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard methodology. 
The Scope 3 emissions included within our 
SBT are material to IHG in accordance with 
the SBTi criteria and include Category 14 
– Franchises and Category 3 – FERA. 
Other Scope 3 categories are not included 
in our 2030 SBT, as they were not deemed 
material for inclusion under IHG’s Science-
based target scope, as per the SBTi criteria.

We use our carbon footprint as a metric to 
track progress against our decarbonisation 
strategy and we report this within the KPI 
section on page 63. We also track our 
year-on-year absolute GHG emissions 
against our 2019 baseline. 

   A breakdown of our GHG emissions, intensity 
metrics and methodology can be found on 
pages 238 to 240 in our Streamlined Energy 
and Carbon Reporting (SECR). 

   See pages 46 to 49 of our 2023 Responsible 
Business Report pages for further details of 
our GHG methodology and data.

Remuneration
To support our decarbonisation strategy and 
transition opportunities, we have embedded 
ESG metrics into executive remuneration 
under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
The 2023/25 LTIP cycle includes targets 
relating to the integration of ECMs into brand 
standards across new-build and existing 
hotels and the adoption of specific ECMs by 
owned, leased, managed lease and managed 
hotels. We track these measures during the 
cycle and will report on achievement in our 
Directors’ Remuneration Report at the end 
of the LTIP cycle. New measures will also be 
included in future LTIP cycles.

   For more details of our Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy see ihgplc.com/investors/corporate-
governance/directors-remuneration-policy

   See pages 116 to 140 for more on our Director’s 
Remuneration Report and 2024/26 LTIP cycle.

Capital deployment 
Given the asset-light nature of our business 
model, we do not consider capital deployment 
to be a significant lever for managing our 
climate-related risks and opportunities, or 
for implementing our transition plan. We may 
incur operational costs associated with 
initiatives, such as new software systems, 
and any capital that is required is included 
within our typical capital expenditure levels 
of up to $350m gross per annum. We do not 
monitor capital expenditure by third-party 
owners of our franchised hotels. 

Internal carbon pricing
Given that a significant portion of our 
emissions stems from our franchised estate, 
where our control is limited, we have 
determined that a conventional internal 
carbon price would not be the most 
impactful decarbonisation mechanism. 
Consequently, our efforts are directed 
toward more suitable mechanisms, as 
outlined in our transition plan on page 57.

External carbon price 
We analysed the IHG Group and individual 
hotel-level exposure to carbon pricing 
legislation by applying a projected carbon 
price to our GHG emissions under a 1.5°C 
temperature scenario. At the IHG Group 
level, analysis found that we are largely 
insulated by our revenue-based fee 
structure, which mitigates a substantial 
proportion of costs being passed through 
to the Group from our hotels. However, we 
acknowledge that exposure could increase 
the risk of hotels becoming less profitable 
or less desirable as an asset class in future. 
By supporting our hotels in decarbonising, 
we aim to reduce this risk. 

Transition risk and opportunities 
We track the year-on-year performance of 
our GHG emissions and other environmental 
indicators, including energy, renewables and 
water and waste data, to evaluate progress 
in mitigating transition risks and optimising 
opportunities. We use energy reduction 
metrics and targets, as well as our 
remuneration target, to drive the uptake 
of ECMs across our estate.

We will explore further potential metrics 
that may be relevant for IHG to monitor and 
manage our climate-related opportunities 
and will disclose these if and when 
appropriate. 

   See our environmental performance data 
on pages 47 to 51 of our 2023 Responsible 
Business Report.

   See pages 28 to 32 of our 2023 Responsible 
Business Report for more details on how IHG 
captures climate-related opportunities.

Physical risks
In 2023, we analysed the exposure of IHG’s 
existing and pipeline estate hotel locations 
to acute and chronic physical risks. We plan 
a deeper examination of this data set, 
conducting further analysis to understand 
the potential impacts on our hotels. 
Additionally, we aim to identify and establish 
metrics for consistently monitoring the most 
significant risks. The findings will be 
disclosed in future reporting. 

   See risk table on page 56 for details of the 
physical risks IHG is most exposed to.

Strategic Report

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Our KPIs are carefully selected to allow us to monitor 

the delivery of our strategy and long-term success. 
They are organised around our strategy, which 

articulates our purpose, ambition and priorities (see page 18). 
KPIs are reviewed annually by senior management to ensure 
continued alignment to our strategy and are included in internal 
reporting and regularly monitored. 

Measures included are those considered most relevant in assessing 
the performance of the business and relate to our growth agenda 
and commitment to our key stakeholders including owners, guests, 
employees, shareholders and the communities in which we work. 
KPIs should be read in conjunction with the other sections of the 
Strategic Report, and where applicable, references to specific 
relevant topics are noted against each KPI.

A guide to this KPI section

Link between KPIs and Director remuneration 
As we continue to focus on delivering 
high-quality growth as in prior years, Directors’ 
remuneration for 2023 was directly related 
to key aspects of our strategy. The following 
indicates which KPIs have impacted 
Directors’ remuneration: 

   For more information on Directors’ 
remuneration, see pages 116 to 140.

2023 status and 2024 priorities

2023 status
•  Strong trading in 2023 resulted in RevPAR improving year-on-year across all 
regions with levels exceeding pre-pandemic peaks in all quarters of the year. 
This was driven by continued strength in leisure and the further return of 
corporate and group bookings.

•  Throughout 2023 we have remained committed to supporting our owners 

to optimise returns as we:

 – Increased IHG One Rewards member enrolments and direct bookings 
following the investments made in our loyalty programme in the prior 
year, enabling our owners to benefit from strong member engagement. 

 – Further enhanced revenue management systems to quickly identify and 

act on revenue opportunities using business intelligence and data. 

 – Improved rate negotiations on behalf of our owners using IHG’s centralised 

RFP processes, with more than 3,000 hotels now using the service.

 – Continued to focus on quality, design and innovation to meet evolving 

needs of guests and drive guest satisfaction while optimising for 
owner returns.

 – Provided owners with end-to-end support to shorten the time taken for 

renovations and openings with our Hotel Purchasing Services, and 
achieved up to 30% savings across various goods and services 
categories.

 – Reduced owner costs through collective purchasing with our Group 

Purchasing Organization agreements across more than 100,000 items.

 – Utilised data-driven, targeted campaigns and offers to appeal to our 

largest, fastest-growing and highest-value segments.

•  Enterprise contribution improved to 79% in 2023, with increased adoption 
and performance of the IHG mobile app since its redesign in 2022. Online 
conversion rate continued to improve from investments in improving the 
online guest experience. GDS also increased as corporate demand 
continued to recover.

  76%

enabling data and forecasting insights to owners. 

•  Commence work on the next-generation Property Management System 

(PMS) offering owners a single platform across properties to enable 
efficient enhancements. 

KPIs

Global RevPAR growth
Revenue per available room: rooms 
revenue divided by the number of 
room nights that are available.

RevPAR growth indicates the 
increased value guests ascribe to our 
brands in the markets in which we 
operate and is a key measure widely 
used in our industry (see page 8). 
Definition of this key performance 
measure can be found on page 84.

Growth in underlying 
fee revenuesa,b 
Group revenue from reportable 
segments excluding revenue 
from insurance activities, revenue 
from owned, leased and managed 
lease hotels, significant liquidated 
damages and current year 
acquisitions, stated at 
constant currency.

Underlying fee revenue growth 
demonstrates the continued 
attractiveness to owners and guests 
of IHG’s franchised and managed 
business (see page 11). 

Total gross revenue from hotels 
in IHG’s System
Total rooms revenue from franchised 
hotels and total hotel revenue from 
managed, exclusive partner and 
owned, leased and managed lease 
hotels. Other than for owned, leased 
and managed lease hotels, it is not 
revenue wholly attributable to IHG, 
as it is mainly derived from hotels 
owned by third parties.

The growth in gross revenue from 
IHG’s System illustrates the value 
of our overall System to our owners 
(see page 11). Definition of this key 
performance measure can be found 
on page 84.

Enterprise contribution to revenue 
The percentage of room revenue 
booked through IHG managed 
channels and sources: direct via our 
websites, apps and call centres; 
through our interfaces with Global 
Distribution Systems (GDS) and 
agreements with Online Travel 
Agencies (OTAs); other distribution 
partners directly connected to our 
reservation system; and Global Sales 
Office business or IHG One Reward 
members that book directly at 
a hotel. 

Enterprise contribution is one 
indicator of IHG value-add and the 
success of our technology platforms 
and our marketing, sales and loyalty 
distribution channels (see page 26). 

a  Use of Non-GAAP measures: In addition to performance measures directly observable in the Group Financial Statements (IFRS measures), additional financial measures (described 

as Non-GAAP) are presented that are used internally by management as key measures to assess performance. Non-GAAP measures are either not defined under IFRS or are adjusted 
IFRS figures. Further explanation in relation to these measures can be found on pages 84 to 88, and reconciliations to IFRS figures, where they have been adjusted, are on pages 226 
to 231.

b  Re-presented to reflect the adoption of IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’. The 2019 and 2020 figures have not been restated and therefore the 2019, 2020 and 2021 growth figures are 

excluded from the comparison.

KPIs

Guest Love
IHG’s guest satisfaction 
measurement indicator.

Guest satisfaction is fundamental to 
our continued success and is a key 
measure to monitor our ability to 
deliver an experience that meets 
and exceeds guests’ expectations 
(see page 22 for details).

Fee margina,b
Operating profit as a percentage 
of revenue, excluding System Fund, 
reimbursement of costs, revenue 
and operating profit from owned, 
leased and managed lease hotels, 
significant liquidated damages, 
insurance activities and 
exceptional items.

Our fee margin progression indicates 
the profitability of our fee revenue 
growth and benefit of our asset-light 
business model (see page 10). 

Adjusted free cash flowa
Cash flow from operating activities 
excluding payments of contingent 
purchase consideration, less 
purchase of shares by employee 
share trusts, maintenance capital 
expenditure and lease payments.

Adjusted free cash flow provides 
funds to invest in the business, 
sustainably grow the dividend and 
return any surplus to shareholders 
(see page 12). It is a key component 
in measuring the ongoing viability 
of our business (see page 50).

IHG® Academy 
Number of people participating in 
one of our in person IHG Academy 
programmes and the number of 
registered users on the IHG Skills 
Academy platform.

Sustained participation indicates the 
strength of our progress in creating 
career building opportunities and 
engagement with the communities 
in which we operate (see page 12).

Absolute carbon footprint
Total GHG emissions (Tonnes 
of CO2e), calculated using the 
market-based methodology to 
take account of renewable energy. 
For more information on our 
carbon footprint methodology 
see page 239.

Our global target is to reduce 
absolute Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 
(FERA and franchised hotels energy) 
GHG emissions 46% by 2030 from 
a 2019 baseline year. 

This target has been validated by the 
SBTi as being consistent with climate 
science to limit global temperature 
rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels. To ensure progress against 
this target, we work with our hotels 
to drive energy efficiency and carbon 
reductions across our estate.

2023 status
•  While there was an increase year-on-year in 2023 due to the recovery in 
occupancy and growth in the size of the estate, we continued to drive 
energy efficiency with a 3.8% reduction in carbon emissions per occupied 
room from 2019 and a 1.9% absolute reduction against the baseline.

•  Continued rollout of ECMs across existing estate hotels and new-builds, 
focused on those measures with a ROI of less than 5 years, supported by 
brand standards and reflected in corporate remuneration targets.

•  Ongoing access to training, tools and resources to help hotels maximise 

their energy efficiency, including resources in the US for owners to identify 
tax and other financial incentives to help fund energy efficiency investments.

•  Expanded US owner access to renewable electricity through our community 

solar programme.

2024 priorities
•  Continue to rollout our decarbonisation roadmap focusing on 

energy-efficiency measures in the existing estate, transitioning to renewable 
energy and developing new-build hotels operating with very low/zero 
carbon emissions. See pages 56 to 58 for more information on our 
transition plan.

•  Developing a programme to accelerate the number of new-build hotels that 
are energy-efficient, have no fossil fuels combusted on-site and are fully 
powered by renewable energy where available.

Chief Financial Officer’s review

Robust trading 
drove RevPAR 
and profitability 
to exceed 
pre‑pandemic 
highs in 2023, 
demonstrating 
the strength of our 
business model.”

Our net debt:adjusted EBITDA ratio at 
the end of the year finished at 2.1x, beneath 
the 2.5-3.0x range we aim to maintain. 
At the year-end, the Group’s total liquidity 
was $2,572m. 

The Board has proposed a final dividend 
of 104.0¢, +10% vs 2022, taking the 
dividend for the year to 152.3¢. The Board 
has also approved a further share buyback 
programme to return an additional $800m 
to shareholders.

Our uses of cash remain unchanged: 
ensuring the business is appropriately 
invested in to optimise growth; funding 
a sustainably growing dividend; and then 
returning excess funds to shareholders. 

Future growth and 2024 priorities 
Looking to 2024, we are confident that travel 
demand will continue to trend ahead of 
pre-pandemic levels. 

We remain focused on our multi-year 
commitment to invest in our brand portfolio, 
loyalty programme and technology platforms. 
Our support to owners has continued through 
uplifts in revenue generation, targeted 
procurement solutions and the management 
of inflationary pressures through build and 
operational efficiencies. 

We are confident in our asset-light, fee-
based business model, combined with our 
track record of fee margin growth through 
focused cost management, which is proven 
to be highly cash-generative, enabling us 
to fund further investments and additional 
shareholder returns.

Michael Glover
Chief Financial Officer 

Conversions represented 37% of openings 
and signings combined, as our brand portfolio 
including our newly launched midscale 
conversion brand, Garner, enables us to more 
readily capture these opportunities that 
contribute to delivering our system growth.

Our continued focus on the quality of our 
estate resulted in a removals rate of 1.5% 
year-on-year, in line with our historical 
underlying average. Net system size 
increased by 3.8%. 

Operating profit 
Operating profit was $1,066m, an increase 
of $438m from the prior year. Operating 
profit from reportable segmentsa improved 
to $1,019m compared to $828m in 2022. 
The strong growth in revenue and our cost 
management resulted in a 3.4%pts 
improvement in fee margina to 59.3%. 

Our growth in operating profit was achieved 
alongside continued investment to support 
future growth, including in the expansion of 
our brand portfolio and investments in our 
enterprise platform. 

Cash generation and liquidity 
Demonstrating the highly cash-generative 
nature of our business, net cash from 
operating activities increased by $247m 
to $893m, and adjusted free cash flowa 
improved by $254m to $819m, compared 
to the prior year. During 2023, we returned 
$1.0bn to shareholders through a 
combination of ordinary dividends and 
share buybacks. 

Michael Glover
Chief Financial Officer

Trading strengthened through 

the year, with RevPAR exceeding 
pre-pandemic highs in each quarter. 

This, combined with growth in our 
well-invested brand portfolio and efficient 
cost base, drove higher profitability and 
fee margin. Our proven cash-generative 
business model resulted in $1.0bn returned 
to shareholders in 2023, while continuing 
to invest for future growth. 

Trading performance 
Following the investments made in our 
loyalty and technology platforms, guest 
enrolments and bookings increased through 
the year, and our owners were able to 
leverage our enterprise to capture demand 
as guests returned, yielding rate and 
occupancy gains.

Travel demand remained healthy, supported 
by strong leisure and continued recovery in 
business and groups, with RevPAR exceeding 
pre-pandemic highs in the year. 

The degree of RevPAR growth varied 
across the regions. Performance in the 
Americas and EMEAA continued to exceed 
pre-pandemic levels through 2023. Greater 
China rebounded significantly following the 
lifting of Covid-19 related restrictions in late 
2022, with the region also exceeding 2019 
levels by the third quarter. 

System growth 
During the year, gross system size increased 
by 5.3%, demonstrating the strength of our 
brand portfolio. 

a  Use of Non-GAAP measures: In addition to performance measures directly observable in the Group Financial Statements (IFRS measures), additional financial measures 

(described as Non-GAAP) are presented that are used internally by management as key measures to assess performance. Non-GAAP measures are either not defined under IFRS 
or are adjusted IFRS figures. Further explanation in relation to these measures can be found on pages 84 to 88, and reconciliations to IFRS figures, where they have been adjusted, 
are on pages 226 to 231.

The reported System Fund and reimbursable 
result improved to a $19m profit from a 
$105m loss, primarily due to the continued 
strength in travel demand on revenues, 
partially offset by increased investments in 
media as well as revenue-driving channels 
and activities. 

Operating exceptional items 
Exceptional items are identified by virtue 
of their size, nature or incidence and are 
excluded from the calculation of adjusted 
earnings per ordinary sharea as well as other 
Non-GAAP measures (see Use of Non-GAAP 
measures, pages 226 to 231) in order 
to allow a better understanding of the 
underlying trading performance and trends 
of the Group and its reportable segments. 
Examples of exceptional items can include, 
but are not restricted to, gains and losses on 
the disposal of assets, impairment charges 
and reversals, the costs of individually 
significant legal cases or commercial 
disputes and reorganisation costs. 

Operating exceptional items totalled $28m 
income, driven by the following items: 

•  share of profits from the InterContinental 
New York Barclay associate of $18m, due 
to an increase in the fair value of the hotel, 
which resulted in the reversal of an $18m 
liability recognised in 2022; and 

•  other operating income of $10m relating 
to amounts receivable from the Group’s 
insurer under its business interruption 
policy for certain owned, leased and 
managed lease hotels due to Covid-19. 

Further information on exceptional items 
can be found in note 6 to the Group 
Financial Statements.

profit measures can be found on pages 84 to 88. 
Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly 
comparable line items within the Group Financial 
Statements can be found on pages 226 to 231. 

Strategic Report

Performance continued
Group continued

Highlights for the year ended 
31 December 2023 
Trading improved significantly in the first 
quarter, as travel in the comparative period 
of 2022 was impacted by the Omicron 
variant of Covid-19. From April, the 
comparatives became subsequently 
tougher as government-mandated travel 
restrictions eased in the prior year. Leisure 
demand in the Americas and EMEAA saw 
continued strength, supported by improving 
corporate and group bookings. Greater 
China rebounded significantly, with RevPAR 
exceeding pre-pandemic levels in the third 
quarter. By the fourth quarter, average daily 
rate remained above pre-pandemic highs 
and occupancy had recovered to within 
1%pt of 2019 levels.

Revenue 
Group comparable RevPAR improved 
year-on-year by 33.0% in the first quarter, 
17.1% in the second quarter, 10.5% in the 
third quarter, 7.6% in the fourth quarter 
and 16.1% in the full year. When compared 
to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, Group 
comparable RevPAR increased 6.8% in the 
first quarter, 9.9% in the second quarter, 
12.8% in the third quarter, 12.7% in the fourth 
quarter and 10.9% in the full year. Overall, 
average daily rate exceeded 2019 levels by 
12.7% and occupancy was 1.1%pts lower. 

Our other key driver of revenue, net system 
size, increased by 3.8% year-on-year to 
946,203 rooms. 

Total revenue increased by $732m (18.8%) 
to $4,624m, including a $411m increase in 
System Fund and reimbursable revenue. 
Revenue from reportable segmentsa 
increased by $321m (17.4%) to $2,164m, 
driven by the improved trading conditions. 
Underlying revenuea increased by $347m 
to $2,164m, with underlying fee revenuea 
increasing by $249m. Owned, leased and 
managed lease revenue increased by $77m. 

Operating profit and margin 
Operating profit improved by $438m from 
$628m to $1,066m, including a $123m 
increase in operating exceptional items, 
from a $95m charge in 2022 to a $28m 
income in 2023, and a $124m increase in 
the reported System Fund and reimbursable 
result, from a $105m loss in 2022 to a $19m 
profit in 2023. 

Operating profit from reportable segmentsa 
increased by $191m (23.1%) to $1,019m, 
with fee business operating profit increasing 
by $187m (23.2%) to $992m, due to the 
improvement in trading which drove a 
$65m increase in incentive management 
fees to $168m. Owned, leased and managed 
lease operating profit improved from $19m 
to $29m. Underlying operating profita 
increased by $201m (24.6%) to $1,019m. 

Fee margina increased by 3.4%pts over 
the prior year to 59.3% benefitting from the 
improvement in trading. 

The impact of the movement in average USD 
exchange rates for 2022 compared to 2023 
netted to a $2m impact on operating profit 
from reportable segmentsa when calculated 
as restating 2022 figures at 2023 exchange 
rates, but negatively impacted operating 
profit from reportable segmentsa by $13m 
when applying 2022 rates to 2023 figures. 

If the average exchange rate during 
January 2024 had existed throughout 2023, 
the 2023 operating profit from reportable 
segmentsa would have been $4m lower. 

System Fund and reimbursable result 
The Group operates a System Fund to 
collect and administer cash assessments 
from hotel owners for specified purposes 
of use including marketing, reservations 
and the Group’s loyalty programme, IHG 
One Rewards. The System Fund also 
benefits from proceeds from the sale of 
loyalty points under third-party co-branding 
arrangements. The Fund is not managed to 
generate a surplus or deficit for IHG over 
the longer term, but is managed for the 
benefit of hotels in the IHG system with the 
objective of driving revenues for the hotels 
in the system.

The growth in the IHG One Rewards 
programme means that, although 
assessments are received from hotels up 
front when a member earns points, more 
revenue is deferred each year than is 
recognised in the System Fund. This can 
lead to accounting losses in the System 
Fund each year as the deferred revenue 
balance grows which do not necessarily 
reflect the Fund’s cash position and the 
Group’s capacity to invest. 

Reimbursable revenue represents 
reimbursements of expenses incurred 
on behalf of managed and franchised 
properties and relates, predominantly, 
to payroll costs at managed properties 
where we are the employer. As IHG record 
reimbursable expenses based upon costs 
incurred with no added mark-up, this 
revenue and related expenses have no 
impact on either operating profit or net 
profit for the year. 

In the year to 31 December 2023, System 
Fund and reimbursable revenues increased 
$411m (20.1%) to $2,460m, driven by the 
continued strength in travel demand, strong 
performance of the IHG One Rewards 
programme since the relaunch in the first 
half of last year.

Accounting principles
The Group results are prepared under 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as described on page 
161 of the Group Financial Statements. 
The application of IFRS requires 
management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions, and those 
considered critical to the preparation 
of the Group results are set out on 
page 162. 

The Group discloses certain financial 
information both including and excluding 
exceptional items. For comparability 
of the periods presented, some of 
the performance indicators in this 
performance review are calculated 
after eliminating these exceptional 
items. An analysis of exceptional items 
is included in note 6. 

Dividends and returns 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 
104.0¢ in respect of 2023, which is growth 
of 10% on 2022. With the interim dividend 
of 48.3¢ paid in October 2023, the total 
dividend for the year would therefore be 
152.3¢, representing an increase of 10%. 
The ex-dividend date is Thursday 4 April 
2024 and the Record Date is Friday 5 April 
2024. The corresponding dividend amount 
in Pence Sterling per ordinary share will be 
announced on Thursday 25 April 2024, 
calculated based on the average of the 
market exchange rates for the three working 
days commencing 22 April 2024. Subject to 
shareholder approval at the AGM on Friday 
3 May 2024, the dividend will be paid on 
Tuesday 14 May 2024.

The dividend payments in 2023 have 
returned close to $250m to IHG’s 
shareholders. An additional $750m of 
surplus capital was returned to shareholders 
through a share buyback programme 
that concluded in December 2023. 
This repurchased 10,643,334 shares at 
an average price of £55.88 per share and 
reduced the total number of voting rights 
in the Company by 6.1%.

The Board has approved a further share 
buyback programme to return an additional 
$800m to shareholders in 2024.

Share price and market capitalisation 
The IHG share price closed at £70.90 on 
Friday 29 December 2023, up 49.5% from 
£47.44 on 30 December 2022. The market 
capitalisation of the Group at the year-end 
was £11.7bn.

For discussion of 2022 results, and 
the changes compared to 2021, refer to 
the 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F. 
The impact of IFRS 17 adoption on 
those years was not material (see 
new accounting standards and other 
presentational changes on page 172)

   ihgplc.com/investors under Annual Report.

a  Definitions for Non-GAAP revenue and operating 
profit measures can be found on pages 84 to 88. 
Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly 
comparable line items within the Group Financial 
Statements can be found on pages 226 to 231. 

Net financial expenses
Net financial expenses decreased to $52m 
from $96m, including $35m in foreign 
exchange gains. Adjusted interesta, as 
reconciled on page 231, and which excludes 
exceptional finance expenses and foreign 
exchange gains/losses and adds back 
interest attributable to the System Fund, 
increased by $9m to an expense of $131m. 
The increase in adjusted interestb was 
primarily driven by an increase in interest 
attributable to the System Fund of $28m 
due to increased base rates, offset by an 
increase in financial income of $17m.

Financial expenses include $78m 
(2022: $82m) of total interest costs on public 
bonds, which are fixed rate debt. Interest 
expense on lease liabilities was $29m 
(2022: $29m).

Fair value gains and losses on contingent 
purchase consideration 
Contingent purchase consideration arose 
on the acquisition of Regent. The net loss of 
$4m (2022: $8m gain) is principally due to 
an unfavourable movement in observable 
US corporate bond rates. The total 
contingent purchase consideration liability 
at 31 December 2023 is $69m (31 December 
2022: $65m). 

Taxation 
The adjusted taxa rate for 2023 was 28% 
(2022: 27%). Taxation within exceptional 
items totalled a charge of $7m (2022: credit 
of $26m) and relates to the tax impacts of 
the operating exceptional items. Tax paid 
in 2023 totalled $243m (2022: $211m). 

IHG pursues an approach to tax that is 
consistent with its business strategy and 
its overall business conduct principles. 
The approach seeks to ensure full compliance 
with all tax filing, payment and reporting 
obligations on the basis of communicative 
and transparent relationships with tax 
authorities. The IHG Audit Committee 
reviews IHG’s approach to tax annually, 
including consideration of the Group’s 
current tax profile. Further information on 
tax can be found in note 8 to the Group 
Financial Statements.

  IHG’s Approach to Tax policy is available at 
ihgplc.com/responsible-business 
under policies.

Earnings per ordinary share 
The Group’s basic earnings per ordinary 
share is 443.8¢ (2022: 207.2¢). Adjusted 
earnings per ordinary sharea increased by 
93.4¢ to 375.7¢.

Cash flow from operations
For the year ended 31 December 2023, 
cash flow from operations was $1,219m, 
an increase of $258m on the previous year, 
primarily reflecting the increase in operating 
profit. Cash flow from operations is the 
principal source of cash used to fund interest 
and tax payments, capital expenditure, 
ordinary dividend payments and additional 
returns of capital of the Group. 

Adjusted free cash flowa 
Adjusted free cash flowa was an inflow of 
$819m, an increase of $254m on the prior 
year. Adjusted EBITDAa increased by $190m 
and the System Fund and reimbursable 
result improved by $124m due to stronger 
trading. Net interest paid decreased by 
$21m primarily due to an increase in interest 
received of $14m. These were partly offset 
by a $22m lower working capital and other 
adjustments cash inflow, an increase in 
contract acquisition (key money) costs net 
of repayments of $37m and $32m higher tax 
payments. Working capital and other 
adjustments includes $123m of cash inflow 
related to deferred revenue, driven primarily 
by the loyalty programme. Exceptional cash 
costs in the year of $29m includes payments 
relating to commercial litigation and disputes; 
in the prior year, the cost of ceasing 
operations in Russia was also included. 

Net and gross capital expenditure 
Net capital expenditurea was $157m 
(2022: $59m) and gross capital expenditurea 
was $253m (2022: $161m). Gross capital 
expenditurea comprised: $146m maintenance 
capex and key money; $61m gross recyclable 
investments; and $46m System Fund capital 
investments. Net capital expenditurea 
includes the offset from $8m proceeds 
from other financial assets, $7m key money 
repayments and $81m System Fund 
depreciation and amortisation. 

Net debta 
Net debta increased by $421m from $1,851m 
at 31 December 2022 to $2,272m at 
31 December 2023. There were $1,035m 
of payments related to ordinary dividends 
and the share buyback programmes during 
the year. The change in net debta includes 
adverse net foreign exchange impacts of 
$105m driven by translation of the Group’s 
sterling bond debt and $26m of other 
non-cash adjustments.

*  Including the impact of derivative financial instruments.

Cash and cash equivalents includes $30m 
(2022: $24m) that is not available for use by 
the Group due to local exchange controls, 
$14m (2022: $11m) which is restricted for 
use on capital expenditure under hotel lease 
agreements and $12m (2022: $12m) subject 
to contractual and regulatory restrictions.

  Information on the maturity profile and interest 
structure of borrowings is included in notes 22 
to 24 to the Group Financial Statements.

Borrowings included bank overdrafts of 
$44m (2022: $55m), which were matched 
by an equivalent amount of cash and cash 
equivalents under the Group’s cash pooling 
arrangements. Under these arrangements, 
each pool contains a number of bank 
accounts with the same financial institution, 
and the Group pays interest on net overdraft 
balances within each pool. Overseas 
subsidiaries are typically in a cash-positive 
position and the matching overdrafts are 
held by the Group’s central treasury 
company in the UK. 

   Information on the Group’s approach to 
allocation of capital resources can be found 
on pages 12 and 13.

Net liabilities
The Group had net liabilities of $1,946m 
at 31 December 2023 ($1,608m at 
31 December 2022). In accordance with 
accounting standards, the Group’s internally 
developed brands are not recorded on the 
Group’s balance sheet, and its asset-light 
business model means that most properties 
from which income is derived are not 
owned. This does not have an impact on the 
ability of the Group to raise external funding 
or the dividend capacity of the Group. 

Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill and other intangible assets of 
$1,099m decreased by $45m compared 
to the prior year driven by amortisation 
of software assets. Goodwill and brands 
have a total net book value of $775m as at 
31 December 2023 ($774m as at 31 December 
2022). Brands relate to the acquisitions of 
Kimpton, Regent and Six Senses. They are 
each considered to have an indefinite life 
given their strong brand awareness and 
reputation, and management’s commitment 
to continued investment in their growth. 
Goodwill and brands are allocated to cash 
generating units (CGUs), and they are tested 
annually for impairment, with no impairment 
recognised in 2023 given the recoverable 
amounts of the CGUs exceeded their carrying 
value. The movement in the year is due to 
exchange rates. 

The remaining balance of intangible assets 
primarily relates to software ($297m).

Working capital 
Trade receivables increased by $87m, from 
$493m at 31 December 2022 to $580m, 
primarily due to improved trading in the last 
quarter of 2023 compared to the last quarter 
of 2022. Current trade and other payables 
increased by $14m, primarily due to $13m 
deferred consideration moving from 
non-current payables in 2023. Deferred 
revenue increased by $124m, driven by an 
increase in the future redeemable points 
balance related to the loyalty programme.

Sources of liquidity
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had 
total liquidity of $2,572m (31 December 
2022: $2,224m), comprising $1,350m of 
undrawn bank facilities and $1,222m of cash 
and cash equivalents (net of overdrafts and 
restricted cash). The change in total liquidity 
from December 2022 of $348m is primarily 
due to a new bond issuance of $657m, 
offset by other net cash outflowsa of $318m.

In November 2023, the Group issued 
a €600m 4.375% bond repayable in 
November 2029. Currency swaps were 
transacted at the same time as the bond was 
issued in order to swap the proceeds and 
interest flows to US Dollars. The currency 
swaps fix the bond debt at $657m, with 
interest payable semi-annually at 5.97%.

The Group currently has $3,122m of sterling 
and euro bonds outstanding. The bonds 
mature in October 2024 (€500m), August 
2025 (£300m), August 2026 (£350m), 
May 2027 (€500m), October 2028 (£400m) 
and November 2029 (€600m). There are 
currency swaps in place on the euro bonds, 
fixing the October 2024 bond at £454m, 
the May 2027 bond at £436m and the 
November 2029 bond at $657m. The Group 
currently has senior unsecured long-term 
credit ratings of BBB from S&P and Baa2 
from Moody’s.

The Group is further financed by a $1.35bn 
syndicated bank revolving credit facility 
(RCF). A one-year extension option was 
exercised during the year and the facility 
now matures in 2028. There is a one-year 
extension option remaining at the lenders 
discretion. There are two financial covenants: 
interest cover and leverage ratio. Covenants 
are tested at half year and full year on a 
trailing 12-month basis. The interest cover 
covenant requires a ratio of Covenant 
EBITDA to Covenant interest payable above 
3.5:1 and the leverage ratio requires Covenant 
net debt to Covenant EBITDA below 4.0:1. 
At 31 December 2023 the leverage ratio was 
2.14 and the interest cover ratio was 12.34. 
See note 24 to the Financial Statements for 
further information. The RCF was undrawn 
at 31 December 2023.

The Group is in compliance with all of the 
applicable financial covenants in its loan 
documents, none of which are expected to 
present a material restriction on funding in 
the near future.

It is management’s opinion that the available 
facilities are sufficient for the Group’s 
present liquidity requirements.

Off-balance sheet arrangements 
At 31 December 2023, the Group had no 
off-balance sheet arrangements that have, 
or are reasonably likely to have, a current 
or future material effect on the Group’s 
financial condition, revenues or expenses, 
results of operations, liquidity, capital 
expenditures or capital resources.

Contingent liabilities 
Contingent liabilities include guarantees 
over loans made to facilitate third-party 
ownership of hotels of up to $50m and 
outstanding letters of credit of $68m. The 
Group may also be exposed to additional 
liabilities resulting from litigation and security 
incidents. See note 30 to the Group 
Financial Statements for further details.

Future cash requirements from 
contractual obligations 
The Group’s future cash flows arising 
from contractual commitments relating 
to long-term debt obligations (including 
interest payable), derivatives, lease liabilities 
and other financial liabilities are analysed in 
note 24 to the Group Financial Statements. 
Other cash requirements relate to future 
pension scheme contributions (see note 27 
to the Group Financial Statements) and 
capital commitments (see note 30 to the 
Group Financial Statements). 

The Group also has future commitments for 
key money payments which are contingent 
upon future events and may reverse.

Disaggregation of total gross revenueb in IHG’s System
Total gross revenue provides a measure of the overall strength of the Group’s brands. 
It comprises total rooms revenue from franchised hotels and total hotel revenue from 
managed hotels and owned, leased and managed lease hotels and excludes revenue from 
the System Fund and reimbursement of costs. Other than owned, leased and managed 
lease hotels, total gross revenue is not revenue attributable to IHG as it is derived from 
hotels owned by third parties. The definition of this key performance measure can be found 
on page 84.

We continued our growth 

momentum across our brand 
portfolio in 2023 by delivering 

industry-leading guest experiences, 
driving competitive owner returns and 
deepening owner relationships. Building 
on our midscale expertise, we launched 
Garner, our new conversion brand, and 
strengthened our Luxury & Lifestyle 
proposition, preparing us for further 
acceleration in years to come.

Industry performance in 2023
Industry RevPAR in the Americas increased 
by 14.5% year-on-year (increased by 31.7% 
against 2019) driven by both average daily 
rate and occupancy which increased by 
12.8% and 0.9%pts, respectively. Canada 
and Latin America drove RevPAR growth 
across the region, followed by the US upper 
upscale and upscale chain scales.

US lodging industry growth continued to 
normalise in 2023, with RevPAR increasing 
by 4.9% (increased 13.2% against 2019) 
and average daily rate increasing by 4.3%. 
Occupancy increased by 0.4%pts on the 
prior year, as strong recovery in urban 
locations and group activity was partially 
offset by increased outbound travel. Room 
supply increased by 0.3%, while conversion 
activity accelerated. RevPAR in the US upper 
midscale chain scale, where the Holiday Inn 
and Holiday Inn Express brands operate, 
increased by 4.2%. 

Industry RevPAR increased by 18.3% in 
Canada driven by both occupancy and 
average daily rate increases. RevPAR in 
Latin America increased by 38.0% and 
in Mexico RevPAR increased by 1.4%. 

IHG’s regional performance in 2023 
IHG’s comparable RevPAR in the Americas 
increased by 7.0% compared to 2022 
(increased by 13.0% against 2019), driven by 
a 1.5%pts increase in occupancy and a 4.6% 
increase in average daily rate. The region 
is predominantly represented by the US, 
where comparable RevPAR increased by 
5.4% compared to 2022 (increased by 11.1% 
against 2019), and where we are most 
weighted towards our upper midscale 
brands, Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express. 
US RevPAR for the Holiday Inn brand 
increased by 4.3%, while the Holiday Inn 
Express brand increased by 5.3%. 

Comparable RevPAR in Canada increased 
by 18.7%, while Mexico increased by 15.5%.

managed lease hotels.

Fee business revenuea increased by $78m 
(8.9%) to $957m. Fee business operating 
profita increased by $46m (6.2%) to $787m, 
driven by improved trading. Fee margina 
decreased to 82.2%, compared to 84.3% in 
2022, reflecting cost investment in growth 
initiatives, including Garner. There were 
$21m of incentive management fees earned 
(2022: $18m).

Owned, leased and managed lease 
revenue increased by $22m to $148m, 
with comparable RevPAR up 16.8% vs 2022 
leading to an increase in owned, leased and 
managed leased operating profit of $28m 
compared to $20m in the prior year.

Review of the year ended 
31 December 2023
With 519,594 rooms (4,414 hotels), the 
Americas represented 55% of the Group’s 
room count. The key profit-generating 
market is the US, and the Group is also 
represented in Latin America, Canada, 
Mexico and the Caribbean. 93% of rooms in 
the region are operated under the franchised 
business model, primarily under our brands 
in the upper midscale segment (including 
the Holiday Inn Brand Family). In the 
upscale market segment, Crowne Plaza is 
predominantly franchised, whereas, in the 
luxury market segment, InterContinental 
branded hotels are operated under both 
franchise and management agreements, 
while Kimpton is mainly managed. 17 of the 
Group’s 19 hotel brands are represented in 
the Americas.

Trading in the Americas was ahead of 
pre-pandemic levels throughout 2023 and 
travel demand remained strong. Double-
digit RevPAR growth in the first quarter 
reflected the prior year comparative period 
being impacted by localised restrictions; 
from April onwards, the comparatives 
strengthened, as government-mandated 
restrictions eased in 2022. 

Continued strength in leisure demand 
resulted in US RevPAR growth ahead of 
pre-pandemic levels. This was further 
supported by the return of corporate and 
group activity through the year.

In Q4, average daily rate increased by 
3.1% and occupancy reduced by 1.0%pts 
year-on-year. Across our US franchised 
estate, which is weighted to domestic 
demand in upper midscale hotels, RevPAR 
was broadly flat in the fourth quarter. The US 
managed estate, weighted to upper upscale 
and luxury hotels in urban locations, saw 
RevPAR increase by 1.8%.

We delivered a strong overall 

2023 by investing in long-term 
growth across our priority 
markets. This included opening iconic 
properties under Regent and Vignette 
Collection within Luxury & Lifestyle, and 
creating elevated guest experiences with 
greater consistency across our brands. 
We are in a stronger position than before 
to accelerate growth.

Industry performance in 2023
Industry RevPAR in EMEAA increased by 
26.0% year-on-year (increased by 26.4% 
against 2019), driven by an improvement in 
both occupancy and average daily rate by 
6.0%pts and 14.7%, respectively. In Europe, 
RevPAR increased by 19.3% (increased 28.4% 
against 2019) driven by both occupancy and 
average daily rate. In the UK, industry RevPAR 
increased by 14.5% compared to 2022 
(increased 25.9% against 2019), where UK 
room demand increased by 5.7% and supply 
increased by 0.4%. In Germany, RevPAR 
increased by 18.5% (increased 3.0% against 
2019). France saw RevPAR increase by 18.1%, 
driven by a 14.2% increase in average 
daily rate.

RevPAR increased by 37.4% (increased 
55.2% against 2019) in the Middle East, 
driven by average daily rate. 

Elsewhere in EMEAA, RevPAR in Australia 
increased 10.8% (increased 21.4% against 
2019), Japan increased by 66.0% (increased 
10.4% against 2019) and Thailand increased 
by 58.2% (increased 10.4% against 2019),

Review of the year ended 
31 December 2023 
Comprising 247,267 rooms (1,237 hotels) at 
the end of 2023, EMEAA represented 26% 
of the Group’s room count. Revenues are 
primarily generated from hotels in the UK 
and gateway cities in continental Europe, the 
Middle East and Asia. The largest proportion 
of rooms in the UK and continental Europe 
are operated under the franchised business 
model, primarily under our upper midscale 
brands (Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn 
Express). In the upscale market segment, 
Crowne Plaza is evenly proportioned 
between the franchised and managed 
operating models, whereas in the luxury 
market segment, the majority of 
InterContinental branded hotels are 
operated under management agreements. 
The majority of hotels in markets outside 
Europe are operated under the managed 
business model.

Through the year, the dispersion of RevPAR 
performance across the region narrowed 
as the easing of travel restrictions impacted 
trading in all markets. RevPAR rebounded 
significantly in the first half of the year when 
compared to 2022; with the pace of recovery 
in the second half reflecting performance in 
the comparable prior period. Leisure travel 
remained the strongest category, with 
corporate bookings and group activity 
continuing to improve as the year went on.

The UK, which saw one of the earlier easing 
of restrictions in the prior year, saw RevPAR 
up 13.7%. Continental Europe increased 
by 25.5%, Australia increased by 18.5% 
and South East Asia & Korea increased by 
41.5%. Elsewhere, RevPAR in the Middle East 
increased 11.7%, as Q4 in the prior year 
benefitted from the FIFA World Cup. RevPAR 
in Saudi Arabia increased by 21.2% and India 
increased by 27.3%. 

EMEAA comparable RevPAR increased 
64% in the first quarter, 27% in the second 
quarter, 16% in the third quarter, 7% in the 
fourth quarter and 24% in the full year, all 
compared to 2022. Compared to 2019, 
RevPAR increased 10% in the first quarter, 
15% in the second quarter, 17% in the third 
quarter, 19% in the fourth quarter and 15% 
in the full year. 

Revenue from the reportable segmenta 
increased by $125m (22.6%) to $677m. 
Operating profit increased by $113m to 
$216m, driven by improved trading, together 
with the non-recurrence of the $49m of 
operating exceptional charges in the prior 
year. Operating profit from the reportable 
segmenta increased by $63m to $215m 
profit. Incentive management fees earned 
improved to $101m (2022: $69m).

Revenue and operating profit from the 
reportable segmenta are further analysed 
by fee business and owned, leased and 
managed lease hotels.

Fee business revenuea increased by $70m 
(24.6%) to $354m. Fee business operating 
profita increased to $214m from $153m in 
the prior year, driven by the improvement 
in trading. Fee margina recovered to 60.5% 
in 2023, compared to 52.7% in 2022.

Owned, leased and managed lease 
revenue increased by $55m to $323m, 
with comparable RevPAR up 32% vs 2022. 
The easing of trading challenges on this 
largely urban-centred portfolio resulted 
in an owned, leased and managed lease 
operating profit of $1m, up from a $1m 
loss in 2022.

Review of the year ended 
31 December 2023 
Comprising 179,342 rooms (712 hotels) 
at 31 December 2023, Greater China 
represented approximately 20% of the 
Group’s room count. The majority of rooms 
in Greater China operate under the 
managed business model, although the 
franchised segment continues to grow, 
representing approximately one-third of 
the region’s open rooms.

Following the lifting of localised travel 
restrictions in December 2022, the trading 
conditions in Greater China rebounded 
significantly through 2023. Monthly RevPAR 
growth against the prior year peaked in the 
March to May period, lapping the travel 
restrictions in place in the comparable prior 
period, with RevPAR peaking in April, up 
more than 170% year-on-year; by July and 
August, RevPAR was up 40% and 38% 
respectively as leisure demand was strong in 
the prior summer period; the fourth quarter 
saw RevPAR improve to 72% year-on-year, 
as more restrictions were re-introduced in 
the prior year comparative period.

For the year, Tier 1 cities saw RevPAR up 97% 
as they lapped travel restrictions in place in 
the comparable period, and benefitted from 
increased domestic travel.

Tier 2-4 cities saw RevPAR increase 62% 
reflecting the lesser impact from Covid-19 
in 2022.

Compared to 2022, overall Greater China 
RevPAR increased 75% in the first quarter 
and 110% in the second quarter, as the 
comparable prior year trading was impacted 
by travel restrictions, before increasing 43% 
in the third quarter and 72% in the fourth 
quarter, with 72% in the full year. Compared 
to 2019, RevPAR declined 9% in the first 
quarter, declined 1% in the second quarter, 
increased 9% in the third quarter, before 
declining 1% in the fourth quarter, with the 
full year increasing 1%.

Review of the year ended 
31 December 2023 
Central revenue, which is mainly comprised 
of technology fee income and revenue from 
insurance activities, increased by $22m (11.1%) 
to $221m. Central revenue was primarily 
driven by the growth of IHG system size 
and the insurance programme. 

Gross costs increased by $21m (6.8%) 
year-on-year, driven by $12m increase in the 
insurance programme which was matched 
by associated revenues and by investment 
spend to support growth initiatives, 
including the integration of Iberostar 
Beachfront Resorts.

The resulting $107m operating loss was 
a decrease of $1m year-on-year.

Key performance measures and non-GAAP measures

Key performance measures and non-GAAP measures used by management
The Annual Report and Form 20-F presents certain financial measures when discussing the Group’s performance which are not measures 
of financial performance or liquidity under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In management’s view, these measures 
provide investors and other stakeholders with an enhanced understanding of IHG’s operating performance, profitability, financial strength 
and funding requirements. These measures do not have standardised meanings under IFRS, and companies do not necessarily calculate 
these in the same way. As these measures exclude certain items (for example, impairment and the costs of individually significant legal 
cases or commercial disputes), they may be materially different to the measures prescribed by IFRS and may result in a more favourable 
view of performance. Accordingly, they should be viewed as complementary to, and not as a substitute for, the measures prescribed by 
IFRS and as included in the Group Financial Statements (see pages 154 to 160).

Global revenue per available 
room (RevPAR) growth

RevPAR is the primary metric used by management to track hotel performance across regions and 
brands. RevPAR is also a commonly used performance measure in the hotel industry.

KPI

RevPAR, average daily rate 
and occupancy statistics are 
disclosed on pages 232 to 234.

Total gross revenue from hotels 
in IHG’s System

A

LT

KPI

Owned, leased and managed 
lease revenue as recorded in the 
Group Financial Statements is 
reconciled to total gross revenue 
on page 70.

RevPAR comprises IHG’s System (see Glossary, page 268) rooms revenue divided by the number of 
room nights available and can be derived from occupancy rate multiplied by the average daily rate 
(ADR). ADR is rooms revenue divided by the number of room nights sold.

References to RevPAR, occupancy and ADR are presented on a comparable basis, comprising groupings 
of hotels that have traded in all months in both the current and comparable year. The principal exclusions 
in deriving this measure are new hotels (including those acquired), hotels closed for major refurbishment 
and hotels sold in either of the comparable years. 

RevPAR and ADR are quoted at a constant US$ conversion rate, in order to allow a better understanding 
of the comparable year-on-year trading performance excluding distortions created by fluctuations in 
currency movements.

Total gross revenue is revenue not wholly attributable to IHG; however, management believes this 
measure is meaningful to investors and other stakeholders as it provides a measure of System 
performance, giving an indication of the strength of IHG’s brands and the combined impact of IHG’s 
growth strategy and RevPAR performance. 

Total gross revenue refers to revenue which IHG has a role in driving and from which IHG derives an 
income stream. IHG’s business model is described on pages 10 to 13. Total gross revenue comprises:

•  Total rooms revenue from franchised hotels;

•  Total hotel revenue from managed and exclusive partner hotels including food and beverage, 

meetings and other revenues, reflecting the value driven by IHG and the base upon which fees are 
typically earned; and 

•  Total hotel revenue from owned, leased and managed lease hotels.

Other than total hotel revenue from owned, leased and managed lease hotels, total gross revenue is not 
revenue attributable to IHG as these managed, franchised and exclusive partner hotels are owned by 
third parties.

Total gross revenue is used to describe this measure as it aligns with terms used in the Group’s 
management, franchise and exclusive partner agreements and, therefore, is well understood by owners 
and other stakeholders.

Revenue and operating 
profit measures
The reconciliation of the most 
directly comparable line item 
within the Group Financial 
Statements (i.e. total revenue 
and operating profit, 
accordingly) to the non-IFRS 
revenue and operating profit 
measures is included on 
pages 226 to 231.

Underlying revenue and 
underlying operating profit 

Revenue and operating profit from (1) fee business, (2) owned, leased and managed lease hotels, and 
(3) insurance activities are described as ‘revenue from reportable segments’ and ‘operating profit from 
reportable segments’, respectively, within note 2 to the Group Financial Statements. These measures 
are presented insofar as they relate to each of the Group’s regions and its Central functions.

Management believes revenue and operating profit from reportable segments are meaningful to 
investors and other stakeholders as they exclude the following elements and reflect how management 
monitors the business:

•  System Fund and reimbursables – the System Fund is not managed to generate a surplus or deficit for 
IHG over the longer term, it is managed for the benefit of the hotels within the IHG system. As described 
within the Group’s accounting policies (page 164), the System Fund is operated to collect and 
administer cash assessments from hotel owners for specific purposes of use including marketing, 
the Guest Reservation System and hotel loyalty programme. 

As described within the Group’s accounting policies (page 164), there is a cost equal to reimbursable 
revenues so there is no profit impact. Cost reimbursements are not applicable to all hotels, and growth 
in these revenues is not reflective of growth in the performance of the Group. As such, management 
does not include these revenues in their analysis of results.

•  Exceptional items – these are identified by virtue of either their size, nature or incidence with 

consideration given to consistency of treatment with prior years and between gains and losses. 
Exceptional items include, but are not restricted to, gains and losses on the disposal of assets, 
impairment charges and reversals, the costs of individually significant legal cases or commercial 
disputes and reorganisation costs. As each item is different in nature and scope, there will be little 
continuity in the detailed composition and size of the reported amounts which affect performance 
in successive periods. Separate disclosure of these amounts facilitates the understanding of 
performance including and excluding such items. The Group’s accounting policy for exceptional 
items and further detail of those items presented as such are included in the Group Financial 
Statements (see pages 165 and 179 to 180).

In further discussing the Group’s performance in respect of revenue and operating profit, additional 
non-IFRS measures are used and explained further below:

•  Underlying revenue;

•  Underlying operating profit;

•  Underlying fee revenue; and

•  Fee margin.

Operating profit measures are, by their nature, before interest and tax. The Group’s reported operating 
profit additionally excludes fair value changes in contingent purchase consideration, which relates to 
financing of acquisitions. Management believes such measures are useful for investors and other 
stakeholders when comparing performance across different companies as interest and tax can vary 
widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest 
expense can be highly dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. 
In addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage 
of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. 

Although management believes these measures are useful to investors and other stakeholders in 
assessing the Group’s ongoing financial performance and provide improved comparability between 
periods, there are limitations in their use as compared to measures of financial performance under 
IFRS. As such, they should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for IFRS measures. 
In addition, these measures may not necessarily be comparable to other similarly titled measures of 
other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation.

These measures adjust revenue from reportable segments and operating profit from reportable 
segments, respectively, to exclude revenue and operating profit generated by owned, leased and 
managed lease hotels which have been disposed, and significant liquidated damages, which are not 
comparable year-on-year and are not indicative of the Group’s ongoing profitability. The revenue and 
operating profit of current year acquisitions are also excluded as these obscure underlying business 
results and trends when comparing to the prior year. In addition, in order to remove the impact of 
fluctuations in foreign exchange, which would distort the comparability of the Group’s operating 
performance, prior year measures are restated at constant currency using current year exchange rates.

Management believes these are meaningful to investors and other stakeholders to better understand 
comparable year-on-year trading and enable assessment of the underlying trends in the Group’s 
financial performance.

Underlying fee revenue growth

KPI

Fee margin

A

KPI

Underlying fee revenue is used to calculate underlying fee revenue growth. Underlying fee revenue is 
calculated on the same basis as underlying revenue as described above but for the fee business only 
and to exclude revenue and operating profit from insurance activities, which are not a core part of the 
Group’s trading operations.

Management believes underlying fee revenue is meaningful to investors and other stakeholders as an 
indicator of IHG’s ability to grow the core fee-based business, aligned to IHG’s asset-light strategy. 

Fee margin is presented at actual exchange rates and is a measure of the profit arising from fee 
revenue. Fee margin is calculated by dividing ‘fee operating profit’ by ‘fee revenue’. Fee revenue and 
fee operating profit are calculated from revenue from reportable segments and operating profit from 
reportable segments, as defined above, adjusted to exclude revenue and operating profit from the 
Group’s owned, leased and managed lease hotels as well as from insurance activities and significant 
liquidated damages. 

Management believes fee margin is meaningful to investors and other stakeholders as an indicator 
of the sustainable long-term growth in the profitability of IHG’s core fee-based business, as the scale 
of IHG’s operations increases with growth in IHG’s system size.

Adjusted interest
Financial income and financial 
expenses as recorded in the 
Group Financial Statements is 
reconciled to adjusted interest 
on page 231.

Adjusted interest is presented before exceptional items and excludes foreign exchange gains/losses 
primarily related to the Group’s internal funding structure and the following items of interest which are 
recorded within the System Fund:

•  Interest income is recorded in the System Fund on the outstanding cash balance relating to the IHG 

loyalty programme. These interest payments are recognised as interest expense for IHG. 

•  Other components of System Fund interest income and expense, including capitalised interest, lease 

interest expense and interest income on overdue receivables.

Given results related to the System Fund are excluded from adjusted measures used by management, 
these are excluded from adjusted interest and adjusted earnings per ordinary share (see below). 

The exclusion of foreign exchange gains/losses provides greater comparability with covenant interest 
as calculated under the terms of the Group’s revolving credit facility. 

Management believes adjusted interest is a meaningful measure for investors and other stakeholders 
as it provides an indication of the comparable year-on-year expense associated with financing the 
business including the interest on any balance held on behalf of the System Fund.

Adjusted tax excludes the impact of foreign exchange gains/losses, exceptional items, System Fund 
and fair value gains/losses on contingent consideration.

Foreign exchange gains/losses vary year-on-year depending on the movement in exchange rates, and 
fair value gains/losses on contingent consideration and, as outlined above, exceptional items also vary 
year-on-year. These can impact the current year’s tax charge. The System Fund (including interest and 
tax) is not managed to a surplus or deficit for IHG over the longer term and is, in general, not subject 
to tax.

Management believes removing these from both profit and tax provides a better view of the Group’s 
underlying tax rate on ordinary operations and aids comparability year-on-year, thus providing a more 
meaningful understanding of the Group’s ongoing tax charge. 

The adjusted tax definition has been amended from 2023 to align to the adjustments made to adjusted 
earnings per share and ensure consistency between measures. The measure has been re-presented for 
prior years to show consistent presentation.

Adjusted earnings per ordinary share adjusts the profit available for equity holders used in the calculation 
of basic earnings per share to remove the System Fund and reimbursable result, interest attributable to 
the System Fund and foreign exchange gains/losses as excluded in adjusted interest (above), change in 
fair value of contingent purchase consideration, exceptional items, and the related tax impacts of such 
adjustments and exceptional tax.

Management believes that adjusted earnings per share is a meaningful measure for investors and other 
stakeholders as it provides a more comparable earnings per share measure aligned with how 
management monitors the business.

rate as recorded in the Group

holders is reconciled to adjusted

Net debt
Net debt is included in note 23

Statements.

Net debt is used in the monitoring of the Group’s liquidity and capital structure and is used by 
management in the calculation of the key ratios attached to the Group’s bank covenants and with the 
objective of maintaining an investment grade credit rating. Net debt is used by investors and other 
stakeholders to evaluate the financial strength of the business. 

Net debt comprises loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities, the principal amounts payable and 
receivable on maturity of derivatives swapping debt values, less cash and cash equivalents. A summary 
of the composition of net debt is included in note 23 to the Group Financial Statements.

Statements is reconciled to

Gross capital expenditure,  
net capital expenditure,  
adjusted free cash flow
The reconciliation of the Group’s 
statement of cash flows (i.e. net 
cash from investing activities, 
net cash from operating 
activities, accordingly) to the 
non-IFRS capital expenditure 
and cash flow measures is 
included on page 230.

Gross capital expenditure

Net capital expenditure

One of the key measures used by the Group in monitoring its debt and capital structure is the net debt: 
adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is managed with the objective of maintaining an investment grade credit 
rating. The Group has a stated aim of targeting this ratio at 2.5-3.0x. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as cash 
flow from operations, excluding cash flows relating to exceptional items, cash flows arising from the 
System Fund and reimbursable result, other non-cash adjustments to operating profit or loss, working 
capital and other adjustments, and contract acquisition costs (key money).

Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as an approximation of operational cash flow generation and is 
also relevant to the Group’s banking covenants, which use Covenant EBITDA in calculating the leverage 
ratio. Details of covenant levels and performance against these are provided in note 24 to the Group 
Financial Statements.

These measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement. 
They are not intended to represent IHG’s residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, nor 
do they reflect the Group’s future capital commitments. These measures are used by many companies, 
but there can be differences in how each company defines the terms, limiting their usefulness as a 
comparative measure. Therefore, it is important to view these measures only as a complement to the 
Group statement of cash flows.

Gross capital expenditure represents the consolidated capital expenditure of IHG inclusive of System 
Fund capital investments (see page 13 for a description of System Fund capital investments and 
recent examples). 

Gross capital expenditure is defined as net cash from investing activities, adjusted to include contract 
acquisition costs (key money). In order to demonstrate the capital outflow of the Group, cash flows 
arising from any disposals or distributions from associates and joint ventures are excluded. The measure 
also excludes any material investments made in acquiring businesses, including any subsequent 
payments of deferred or contingent purchase consideration included within investing activities, which 
represent ongoing payments for acquisitions.

Gross capital expenditure is reported as either maintenance, recyclable or System Fund. 
This disaggregation provides useful information as it enables users to distinguish between:

•  System Fund capital investments which are strategic investments to drive growth at hotel level; 

•  Recyclable investments (such as investments in associates and joint ventures and loans to facilitate 
third-party ownership of hotel assets), which are intended to be recoverable in the medium term 
and are to drive the growth of the Group’s brands and expansion in priority markets; and

•  Maintenance capital expenditure (including contract acquisition costs), which represents 

a permanent cash outflow. 

Management believes gross capital expenditure is a useful measure as it illustrates how the Group 
continues to invest in the business to drive growth. It also allows for comparison year-on-year.

Net capital expenditure provides an indicator of the capital intensity of IHG’s business model. Net 
capital expenditure is derived from net cash from investing activities, adjusted to include contract 
acquisition costs (net of repayments) and to exclude any material investments made in acquiring 
businesses, including any subsequent payments of deferred or contingent purchase consideration 
included within investing activities which are typically non-recurring in nature. Net capital expenditure 
includes the inflows arising from any disposal and loan repayment receipts, or distributions from 
associates and joint ventures.

In addition, System Fund depreciation and amortisation relating to property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets, respectively, is added back, reducing the overall cash outflow. This reflects the way 
in which System Funded capital investments are recovered from the System Fund, over the life of the 
asset (see page 13).

Management believes net capital expenditure is a useful measure as it illustrates the net capital 
investment by IHG, after taking into account capital recycling through asset disposal and the funding 
of strategic investments by the System Fund. It provides investors and other stakeholders with visibility 
of the cash flows which are allocated to long-term investments to drive the Group’s strategy.

KPI

Adjusted free cash flow is net cash from operating activities adjusted for: (1) the inclusion of the cash 
outflow arising from the purchase of shares by employee share trusts reflecting the requirement to 
satisfy incentive schemes which are linked to operating performance; (2) the inclusion of maintenance 
capital expenditure (excluding contract acquisition costs); (3) the inclusion of the principal element of 
lease payments; and (4) the exclusion of payments of deferred or contingent purchase consideration 
included within net cash from operating activities.

Management believes adjusted free cash flow is a useful measure for investors and other stakeholders 
as it represents the cash available to invest back into the business to drive future growth and pay the 
ordinary dividend, with any surplus being available for additional returns to shareholders.

Changes in definitions to the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts
The following definitions have been amended:

•  The definition and calculation of Total Gross Revenue has been amended to include revenue from exclusive partner hotels, as this revenue 
reflects the value that IHG generates for its exclusive partner hotels. The value of Total Gross Revenue is unchanged in comparative years.

•  Underlying fee revenue and operating profit measures have been amended to separate revenue and related costs from insurance 
activities from fee business revenue and costs. This change is due to the adoption of IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’, which requires 
insurance related revenue and costs to be disclosed separately from fee revenues. Underlying fee revenue and operating profit measures 
have also been amended. Comparative periods have been restated for this change.

•  The definition and reconciliation of fee margin has been amended to remove the exclusion of insurance revenues and costs, as insurance 
related revenues and costs are no longer included as part of fee business (see above). Where information is available, comparative periods 
have been re-presented for this change.

•  The adjusted tax definition has been amended to align to the adjustments made to adjusted earnings per share to ensure consistency 

between measures. Fair value gains/losses on contingent consideration and System Fund interest are therefore now excluded from the 
calculation of adjusted tax. The measure has been restated for prior years to show consistent presentation.

   The performance review should be read in conjunction with the Non-GAAP reconciliations on pages 226 to 231 and the Glossary on pages 267 to 268.

Governance

Chair’s overview

The Board seeks 
to ensure that 
IHG’s culture and 
governance promote 
the Group’s long-term 
success and deliver 
sustainable value for 
our shareholders.”

45%

Women on IHG’s Board

IHG Directors from a 
minority ethnic background

During 2023, the Board sought to build on the Group’s 

strong foundation and culture of governance and to gain 
a deeper understanding of the trends and factors affecting 
the long-term sustainable success, resilience and future prospects 
of the Group. 

The Board strives to enhance an environment of transparency 
and accountability, to ensure that reliable governance frameworks 
and processes are maintained, while encouraging an approach to 
decision-making that facilitates the Group’s strategic priorities in 
a constantly evolving geopolitical and regulatory environment. 

Across the year, the Board maintained a high level of engagement 
and interaction with the Group’s stakeholders. Extensive shareholder 
consultation was undertaken by the Board, particularly in relation 
to the approach to remuneration and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy approved during the year. 

The Board also enjoyed continued constructive engagement with 
owners and colleagues throughout the year. For example, I was 
pleased to spend time meeting with the CEO of the IHG Owners 
Association, which provided valuable insight into the perspectives 
of our owners on the Group’s strategic initiatives. I also enjoyed 
meeting and hearing directly from a number of colleagues as part 
of the Board’s Voice of the Employee engagement programme. 

Focus areas and activities 
The Board had another active year in 2023, and more information 
on its activities is given on pages 101 to 103. 

The Board oversaw the evolution of the Group’s strategy and 
endorsed the refinement of the Group’s ambition to focus on 
accelerating growth, as well as the enhancements to the strategic 
pillars and the new growth behaviours. 

The Board actively engaged with the Group’s growth agenda, 
supporting and approving the launch of the Garner brand. 

The Board was further pleased to support the Group’s creation 
of value for shareholders by approving the $750m share buyback 
programme announced and completed during the year as well as 
the regular dividend payments. 

Cybersecurity was again a significant area of focus for the Board. 
The Board discussed the broad nature of cyber risk with external 
specialists, including emerging risk areas, such as the rise of AI, 
and the approach to prioritising mitigating initiatives. The Board also 
monitored throughout the year the Group’s approach to cyber risk 
and the increased investment in security measures, as well as the 
culture of security awareness and the approach to training across 
the organisation. 

Board composition
During the year, we also saw the successful execution of Board 
succession planning with changes at both the Executive and 
Non-Executive levels. At the Executive level, Elie Maalouf and 
Michael Glover succeeded Keith Barr and Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson 
as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer respectively.

At the Non-Executive level, in the first half of the year, as previously 
announced, Graham Allan and Byron Grote transitioned to become 
Chair of the Responsible Business Committee and Chair of the Audit 
Committee respectively.

The execution of succession planning continued with Angie Risley 
joining the Board in September and succeeding Jo Harlow as Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee from 1 January 2024, following Jo’s 
retirement from the Board. We also announced the appointment of 
Ron Kalifa as Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 January 2024. 
Further information on Board appointments during the year can be 
found in the Nomination Committee Report on page 115.

I would again like to express my and the Board’s sincere gratitude 
to Keith, Paul and Jo for their contribution to IHG.

Compliance and our dual listing
IHG continues to operate as a dual-listed company with a premium 
listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the 
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Under the UK listing rules, we are 
obliged to make a statement as to how we have applied the principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). Under the NYSE 
listing rules, as a foreign private issuer, we are required to disclose 
any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices 
differ from those of US companies. To ensure consistency of 
information provided to both UK and US investors, we produce 
a combined Annual Report and Form 20-F. 

Our Statement of compliance with the Code is on pages 141 and 142. 
A summary outlining the differences between the Group’s UK 
corporate governance practices and those followed by US 
companies can be found on page 258. 

Looking forward
In 2024, the Board will focus on the outcomes of the external 
evaluation completed in 2023 and the delivery of the Group’s 
strategic objectives, while ensuring that the integrity of the 
Group’s governance framework is maintained.

Deanna Oppenheimer
Chair of the Board
19 February 2024

I am also proud to report that at the end of 2023, our Board 
continues to exceed the FTSE 100 Women Leaders Review target 
for women on a FTSE 100 Board. With regard to the Parker Review 
(the FTSE 350 Ethnic Diversity Submission), IHG continues to 
exceed the original target set by the Review of at least one director 
from an ethnically diverse background, with four ethnically diverse 
directors. Likewise, IHG has set targets for ethnic diversity in relation 
to senior management. Further detail and reporting on these targets 
can be found on pages 30 and 31. 

Committee activities
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to its Committees to 
assist in ensuring effective corporate governance across the business. 
During 2023: 

•  the Audit Committee focused on monitoring the Group’s risk 
management and internal controls systems (see its report on 
pages 107 to 111);

•  the Remuneration Committee focused on developments in relation 
to incentive plans, including approval of the Deferred Award Plan 
rules and the inclusion of ESG metrics in the Long Term Incentive 
Plan (see its report on pages 116 to 140);

•  the Responsible Business Committee focused on progress 

against the 2023 responsible business priorities, which support 
the Company’s Journey to Tomorrow responsible business plan 
(see its report on pages 112 and 113); and

•  the Nomination Committee focused on the execution of Board 
and Committee succession plans and the external evaluation 
(see its report on pages 114 and 115).

Further detail on the Group’s governance structure is given on 
page 100.

Board performance review 
During the year, an external review of the effectiveness of the Board 
and its Committees was undertaken. I am pleased to report that 
overall the review supported the positive conclusions of the Board 
and its Committees as to their effectiveness. Further details of the 
external evaluation can be found on pages 104 to 106. Individual 
director feedback assessments were also conducted, details of 
which can be found on page 106.

with suppliers, customers and others; its impact on the community and environment; the desirability of maintaining high standards of 
business conduct; and the need to act fairly between members of the company. The table below summarises some of the main matters 
dealt with by the Board during the year and how it took the Section 172 factors into account. The relevant Section 172 factors are identified

Annual Board strategy meeting

The 2023 Annual Board strategy meeting was held in Atlanta at the Group’s Americas region headquarters. The Board undertook a 
detailed review in respect of the following areas: 

•  the industry landscape and performance; 

•  the competitive context; 

•  IHG’s business model, financial model and strategy; and 

•  strategic choices to strengthen performance. 

The meeting also included an ‘outside-in’ perspective from an external adviser on the Group’s trajectory, further opportunities 
for growth and risks to delivery of the plan. 

Each Board member received a full briefing in advance of the Board strategy meeting, which enabled a productive and 
wide-ranging discussion with concrete outcomes, oriented around a relentless focus on growth, a strong commercial engine and 
a high-performance culture. Outcomes and action items were also addressed at subsequent Board meetings.

Board members also had the opportunity to engage informally with colleagues from our Atlanta office.

  See pages 36 and 37 for information about how we have engaged with our stakeholders in 2023. Further details of our regard for our people, communities 
and the planet are on page 3 and pages 28 to 35.

Our shareholders and investors

During 2023, IHG continued its open dialogue with shareholders 
and investors and conducted its annual programme of investor 
relations activities with support from its brokers and advisers. 
The Board received regular updates and considered feedback 
as outlined on page 101. In addition, our Registrar and American 
Depositary Receipts (ADR) programme custodians have supported 
shareholders and ADR holders with their queries. 

Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
The Board was pleased to meet shareholders in person at the 
2023 AGM.

Our 2024 AGM will be held on Friday 3 May 2024. The notice of 
meeting will be sent to shareholders and made available on our 
website in due course.

Committee Chairs and the Senior Independent Director are available 
for shareholders if they have concerns they wish to discuss.

and investors is included on page 36.

Director appointments and induction

Director appointments 
Details of the appointments to the Board made during 2023 are 
described in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 114 and 115. 

•  Arthur de Haast as a member of the Audit Committee 

of Chalet Hotels Limited.

•  Byron Grote as Interim Chair of Tesco PLC.

New Director inductions 
Upon appointment, all new Directors undergo a comprehensive and 
formal induction programme that is tailored to meet their individual 
needs and respective roles on the Board. We believe this is crucial 
to ensure our Directors have a full understanding of all aspects of 
our business and familiarity with the Group’s purpose, culture and 
values to ensure they can contribute effectively to the Board.

For Michael Glover, a bespoke induction plan focused on his transition 
to an Executive Director and Executive Committee role was prepared, 
with a particular focus on his responsibilities as CFO. His induction 
included meetings with key external advisers and stakeholders and 
an overview of corporate governance requirements in relation to his 
responsibilities as an Executive Director. 

Given Elie Maalouf’s longstanding role on the Board and Executive 
Committee, following his appointment as CEO, a targeted transition 
plan was put in place focusing on aspects specific to his role as 
CEO, with a particular emphasis on key investor, colleague, owner, 
media and industry relationships.

For Angie Risley and Ron Kalifa, tailored induction plans were prepared 
in advance of their appointment to the Board. Their plans broadly 
covered the following topics, while being tailored to their Committee 
appointments and roles, with a particular emphasis on understanding 
IHG’s business, long-term strategy, risks and opportunities within 
the business and governance processes and controls:

•  Jo Harlow as Senior Independent Director of Halma PLC.

•  Elie Maalouf as a member of the World Travel & Tourism Council’s 

Executive Committee.

In each case, the Board took into account other appointments, the 
time commitment required for each role and the context of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, including institutional investor and 
proxy adviser guidelines concerning over-boarding. It was concluded 
that the additional appointments should not adversely impact their 
performance but should enhance their ability to provide 
constructive challenge and strategic guidance. 

Ongoing Director training and development
We understand the importance of an ongoing training programme 
for Directors to enable them to fully understand the Group’s business 
and operations in the context of the rapidly developing environment 
in which it operates. The Chair regularly reviews the training and 
development needs with each Director and the Board is made aware 
of training opportunities.

Board and Committee meetings are regularly used to update 
Directors on developments in the environment in which the business 
operates and in-depth presentations are provided on key topical 
areas. In 2023, these sessions included updates on assurance and 
governance matters; perspectives in relation to corporate philanthropy 
and community investment; and market updates in relation to 
remuneration and pensions.

•  information on the Group’s purpose, culture, values and strategy, 
including its business model, brands and the markets in which 
it operates;

In addition, the Company Secretary provides regular updates on 
regulatory, corporate governance and legal matters, and Directors 
are able to meet individually with senior management if necessary.

•  key strategic initiatives;

•  our approach to internal controls and our risk management strategy; 

•  information on the Board, its Committees and IHG’s governance 

processes;

•  a reminder of the rules relating to maintaining the confidentiality of 
inside information and restrictions in dealing in IHG shares, together 
with a briefing on the policies and procedures IHG has in place to 
ensure compliance with such rules; and

•  meetings with members of the Board and the Executive Committee, 
senior management from functions across the Group, the external 
Auditor and other key external advisers.

Additional appointments 
During 2023, the Board considered and endorsed the following 
additional appointments of Directors:

•  Graham Allan as Chair of the Remuneration Committee 

of Associated British Foods PLC.

External evaluation
In line with best practice, each year, the performance and 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees are carefully 
reviewed through a formal evaluation process, which is traditionally 
facilitated externally every three years. An external evaluation was 
last completed in 2019, with internal evaluations completed in 2020, 
2021 and 2022 following agreement to defer an external evaluation 
to 2023 due to the recent appointment of the Chair in 2022.

In 2023, an external evaluation was undertaken and conducted 
by Independent Audit Limited (‘IA’), following a comprehensive 
evaluation of several providers. IA has no prior connection with the 
Company or any of its Directors, with the exception of conducting 
an external review for Hargreaves Lansdown PLC in 2021, a company 
on which the Chair has previously served as a director.

An outline of the evaluation process and details of the results of the 
review are set out on the following pages.

discussion with the 
Company Secretary 
and the Chair and 
agreed by each 
Committee Chair.

Review of Board 
papers and meeting 
observation 

A review of Board 
papers and the 
observation of 
meetings of the 
Board and of the 
Audit, Nomination, 
and Responsible 
Business Committees 
was conducted by IA.

Completion of 
questionnaires and 
follow – up 
interviews 

The Board 
questionnaires were 
completed by all 
Board members, the 
Company Secretary 
and relevant 
members of senior 
management and 
follow-up interviews 
with each member 
of the Board and 
Company Secretary 
were conducted. 

Reporting

IA analysed the 
results and complied 
a report for the  
Board and each 
Committee which  
was discussed in 
draft with the Chair 
and Company 
Secretary and 
presented to the 
Board and each  
of the Committees  
for discussion  
and consideration. 
IA invited Board 
members to follow up 
individually if desired.

Results of Governance Review

Strengths:

The results of IA’s external review noted 
several strengths:

1)   The Board’s composition is comprised 
of a good mix of skills, experience, and 
personalities that work well with each other 
and management. 

2)  New Board members have brought a 

high degree of openness and willingness 
to engage. 

3)  Engagement has been open and 

transparent, and Board members are able 
to contribute to productive debate in the 
decision-making process.

Areas of focus for the year ahead:

1)   Consideration of the ‘Big Trends’: 

continued consideration of industry trends 
and dynamics, including ever-changing 
customer needs and expectations and 
competitor actions.

2)   Executive succession planning: following 
both CEO and CFO succession, looking to 
the capabilities, skills, diversity and 
characteristics needed for the future, 
focusing on Executive succession planning 
and strengthening the Board’s relationship 
with recently promoted senior 
management.

3)   Risk, technology & ESG: given the 

dynamic external environment, continued 
focus on IHG’s overarching Risk 
Management Framework, emerging 
technologies and the wider ESG landscape.

Board Committees
The external evaluation process also assessed the effectiveness 
and support provided by and to the Board Committees. Through the 
process, it was confirmed that they have the necessary attributes to 
support their effective operation and that the Committees are well 
integrated into the Board decision-making processes. Each of the 

Committees reviewed the findings and agreed the respective 
actions with consideration of the overall Board findings where they 
were deemed relevant to the Committee’s work. Further details are 
set out in each Committee Report on pages 107, 112, 115 and 125.

Performance evaluation of Directors

In addition to the external Board evaluation process outlined 
above, the Chair assessed the individual performance of the 
Non-Executive Directors and carried out one-to-one meetings 
with each of them, focusing on their contribution to the Board 
and Principal Committees and engagement with fellow 
Directors, taking into account their relevant skills, knowledge 
and experience. Particular points of note were shared with the 
individual Directors and overall, the Chair concluded that the 
Directors perform their duties independently and effectively 
and that they dedicate sufficient time to discharge their 
Board responsibilities. 

The performance assessment of the Chair was led by the SID. 
The evaluation focused on: 

•  overall leadership of the Board; 

•  the Board’s culture and the Chair’s ability to facilitate 

constructive Board relations; and 

•  managing the Board in accordance with high standards 

of corporate governance. 

The CEO evaluation was led by the Chair, who collected 
feedback to a series of questions from the Non-Executive 
Directors. Key areas of focus included: 

•  the Group’s performance and impact of the CEO; 

•  the relationship and ability to work collaboratively 

and transparently with the Board; 

•  delivery of the Group’s growth agenda; 

•  regard for community and the environment; 

•  building talent and organisational capabilities; and 

•  progress in relation to IHG’s 2023 plan and future 

strategic priorities.

Key duties and role of the Committee
Key objectives and summary of responsibilities
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that IHG maintains 
a strong control environment. It monitors the integrity of IHG’s 
financial reporting, including significant financial reporting 
judgements; maintains oversight and reviews our systems of internal 
control and risk management; monitors and reviews the effectiveness 
and performance of internal and external audit functions; and reviews 
the behaviours expected of IHG’s employees through the Code of 
Conduct and related policies. 

The Committee’s role, responsibilities and authority delegated to it 
by the Board are set out in its Terms of Reference (ToR), which are 
reviewed annually and approved by the Board. 

  The ToR are available at ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate governance.

As noted, the Committee focused its attention on reviewing and 
obtaining assurance in relation to emerging and evolving risks as 
well as the Group Financial Statements and controls. Key areas 
of focus over the year have been:

•  the evolution of the Group’s financial governance programme, 
including streamlining processes and automation of controls;

•  internal controls and assurance in connection with the Group’s 

HR system transition and Iberostar integration;

•  the Group’s approach to managing on-going compliance risks, 
including in relation to hotel operational safety and security, 
supply chain, data privacy and ethics and compliance.

Membership and attendance at meetings
Details of the Committee’s membership and attendance at meetings 
are set out on page 96. The Chair of the Board, CEO, CFO, Group 
Financial Controller, Head of Risk and Assurance, Deputy Company 
Secretary and our external Auditor attended all meetings in 2023. 
The General Counsel and Company Secretary also normally attends 
all meetings and in 2023, attended all but one of the meetings. 
Other attendees are invited to meetings as appropriate and the CEO 
and all other Directors were invited to Committee meetings where 
the approval of financial reporting was considered and discussed. 
The Committee continues to hold private sessions with the internal 
and external Auditors without the presence of management to 
ensure that a culture of transparency is maintained. 

The Committee Chair continues to have recent and relevant 
financial experience and all members of the Committee are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. In accordance with the Code, 
the Board also considers that the Committee as a whole possesses 
competence relevant to the Company’s sector, having a range of 
financial and commercial experience in the hospitality industry and 
the broader commercial environment in which the Group operates. 
Further details of the skills and experience of the Committee 
members can be found on pages 93 to 95.

Reporting to the Board
Following each Committee meeting, the Committee Chair updates 
the Board on key issues discussed. The papers and minutes for each 
meeting are circulated to all Board members, who are invited to 
request further information if required and to provide any challenge 
where necessary. 

Effectiveness of the Committee
During the year, the Committee’s effectiveness was reviewed as part 
of the external Board evaluation process. The Committee concluded 
that it remains effective, focuses on the right issues and provides a 
good level of challenge. An area identified for future focus is further 
developing Committee papers to continue to enhance discussions.

Audit Committee Report continued

Focus areas and activities
Financial and narrative reporting
During the year, the Committee reviewed and recommended 
approval of the interim and annual Financial Statements 
(considering the relevant accounting and reporting matters such 
as key judgement areas, going concern and viability statements, 
the financial reporting impacts of commercial litigation and 
disputes, exceptional items and impairment reviews) and the 
Group’s quarterly trading updates. All members of the Board 
are asked to attend these meetings.

As well as receiving input and guidance from the external Auditor 
on the areas outlined above, the Committee also received regular 
reports from the Chair of the Disclosure Committee, which liaised 
closely with other external advisers of the Group to ensure that 
disclosure and regulatory requirements were being appropriately 
considered and met. Copies of the Disclosure Committee’s minutes 
were also provided to the Committee. 

The Committee received early drafts of the Annual Report and 
Form 20-F 2023 (Annual Report), and when providing comments 
considered: (i) the process for preparing and verifying the Annual 
Report, which included review by the Executive Committee and 
input from senior employees in the Company Secretariat, Legal, 
Operations, Strategy, Human Resources, Finance, Risk and 
Assurance teams; (ii) a report from the Chair of the Disclosure 
Committee; and (iii) a checklist prepared by the Annual Report team 
confirming compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements.

The Committee also considered management’s analysis of how the 
content, taken as a whole, was ‘fair, balanced and understandable’, 
and whether it contained the necessary information for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position, performance, business model and 
strategy. In order to reach this conclusion, a dedicated project 
team worked on the contents of the Annual Report and a detailed 
verification process to confirm the accuracy of the information 
contained within the Annual Report was undertaken by the Financial 
Planning and Analysis department. The Committee then considered 
both the structure and content of the Annual Report to ensure that 
the key messages were effectively and consistently communicated 
and that meaningful links between the business model, strategy, KPIs, 
principal risks and remuneration were clearly identified throughout 
the Annual Report. The Committee also considered the proportionate 
and consistent consideration of climate matters across the Annual 
Report, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) statement and an asset-by-asset review for 
impairment purposes.

Alongside this review, the Committee considered guidance provided 
by the FRC throughout the year, including in relation to the concept 
of an Audit and Assurance Policy within the proposed changes to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Company’s consultation 
response to the FRC on the proposal was reviewed by the Committee. 
The Committee also reviewed trends in ESG reporting requirements 
and considered governance and assurance implications. 

Following a review of the contents of the Annual Report alongside 
the aforementioned criteria, the Committee reported its 
recommendation to approve the Annual Report to the Board.

Significant matters in the 2023 Financial Statements
Throughout 2023, the Committee provided ongoing challenge 
to management’s accounting, reporting and internal controls. 
The Committee discussed with management and the external 
Auditor the significant areas of complexity, management judgement 
and estimation in relation to the Financial Statements, and the 
impact of any accounting developments or legislative changes. 
The Committee has satisfied itself that management had adequately 
identified and considered all potentially significant accounting and 
disclosure matters. The key items discussed are outlined on pages 
110 and 111.

Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for establishing procedures to manage 
risk, overseeing the internal control framework and determining 
the nature and extent of the principal risks the Company is willing 
to take to achieve its long-term objectives. The Committee supports 
the Board by reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems and assessing emerging and 
principal risks and undertook such a review in respect of 2023.

In order to effectively review the internal control and risk 
management systems, the Committee:

•  receives regular reports from management, the Risk and Assurance 
team and the external Auditor on the effectiveness of the systems 
for risk management and internal controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls;

•  reviews the process by which risks are identified (including 

procedures in place to identify emerging risks and linkage to wider 
consideration of strategy and resilience) and assesses the timeliness 
and effectiveness of action taken by management, including regular 
reports on the Company’s overall risk management and internal 
controls systems and principal risks; and

•  receives regular reports relevant to risk management and internal 
controls, both financial and non-financial, to ensure that current 
and emerging risks are identified and assessed and that there is 
an appropriate management response (see pages 42 to 49 for 
further detail on our risks and initiatives to manage them).

As part of the Committee’s review of the internal control and risk 
management systems, key financial, operational and compliance 
controls across the business continue to be monitored and tested 
throughout the year. The Committee assesses the approach to 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 (SOX) compliance in accordance with 
our US obligations and reviews reports on the progress of the SOX 
programme at each meeting. During the year, the Committee 
received updates on the delivery of the training programme for 
SOX control owners and the longer-term objective of reducing the 
overall control count.

During 2023, the Committee considered the activity undertaken by 
the Risk and Assurance team to review and refresh risk profiles and 
integrate resilience planning into the prioritisation and capability 
building of the Group’s business teams. The Committee also 
received updates on:

•  key assurance projects relating to the transition of the Group’s 

primary HR system and integration in respect of the 
Iberostar alliance;

•  supply chain risks and the strategy for mitigating uncertainties, 

noting the work of the Supply Chain Risk Council to drive awareness 
of emerging issues among relevant stakeholders and embedding 
risk management and internal control approaches in relation to 
supply chain; and

•  the Group’s approach to managing hotel operational safety and 
security risks, including the impact of conversion hotels and the 
development and integration of new business models such as 
branded residential and all-inclusive resorts on IHG’s operational 
safety and security framework.

Having reviewed the internal controls and risk management systems 
throughout the year, the Committee concluded that the Group 
continues to have an effective system of risk management and 
internal controls, and that there are no material weaknesses in the 
control environment.

Tax risks, policies and governance
The Group’s CFO has responsibility for tax and tax policies at Board 
level. These policies and procedures are subject to regular review 
and update and are approved by the Audit Committee. Procedures 
to minimise risk include the preparation of thorough tax risk 
assessments for all transactions carrying material tax risk and,

where appropriate, material tax uncertainties are discussed and 
resolved with tax authorities in advance.

  Our Approach to Tax document is available at 
ihgplc.com/en/responsible-business/policies-and-position-statements

Principal risk areas
During the year, the Committee discussed and assessed the range 
and aggregate impact of dynamic risks that the Group faced in the 
context of the ongoing volatility in the geopolitical and macroeconomic 
environment. Alongside the review of the overall portfolio of risks, 
the Committee requested and received updates on the following 
specific areas:

•  emerging risks in relation to the use and management of 

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) and the management by 
the business of both upside and downside risks relating to Gen AI;

•  physical and chronic climate risks to the hospitality sector; and

•  the approach to cross-border data transfers.

Further details of our principal risks, uncertainties and review 
process can be found on pages 42 to 49.

Non-audit services
IHG’s Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy helps to 
ensure that the external Auditor’s independence and objectivity are 
not impacted by non-audit services provided by the external Auditor. 
The policy is reviewed by the Audit Committee annually.

The policy requires that pre-approval is obtained from the Audit 
Committee for all services provided by the external Auditor before 
any work can commence, without any de minimis threshold in line 
with US SEC requirements and UK ethical standards. The Committee 
reviewed the audit and non-audit fees incurred with the external 
Auditor and noted that there had been no prohibited services 
(as defined by SOX or under UK ethical standards) provided to the 
Group during the year. The Committee is prohibited from delegating 
non-audit services approval to management and compliance with 
the policy is actively managed.

IHG is committed to maintaining non-audit fees at a low level and 
the Committee remains cognisant of the guidelines of investor 
advisory bodies on non-audit fees. During 2023, 10% of services 
provided to the Group were non-audit services (2022: 11%), primarily 
related to System and Organisation Controls (SOC) Reports. These 
services are typically performed by external auditors as knowledge 
of the Company or Group is necessary for the provision of the 
non-audit services. Details of the fees paid to PwC for non-audit and 
statutory audit work during 2023 can be found on page 178. The 
Committee is satisfied that the Company was compliant during the 
year with the FRC’s Ethical and Auditing Standards in respect of the 
scope and maximum permitted level of fees incurred for non-audit 
services provided by PwC. Where non-audit work is performed by 
PwC, both the Company and PwC ensure adherence to robust 
processes to prevent the objectivity and independence of the 
external Auditor being compromised.

Risk and assurance – Internal Audit
The Committee discusses and approves the Internal Audit annual 
plan, which aims to provide objective and insightful assurance that 
appropriate controls are in place to support our strategy and growth 
ambitions. Progress against the Internal Audit plan is reported at 
each meeting and, during 2023, the Committee reviewed several 
areas set out in the plan, including programme governance and 
oversight of expenditure and benefit delivery. 

The 2024 plan presented to the Committee in November 2023 
maintains focus on the integrity of the risk management and internal 
control system, providing independent assurance to complement 
management’s own activities where these are relatively mature, 
well governed and/or regulated. Areas of focus in 2024 include 
management of interdependencies between major technology 

programmes, control arrangements for data and information usage, 
storage and transfer and management’s preparedness for fast-
evolving legislation. 

Following consideration, the Committee confirmed its agreement 
to the 2024 Internal Audit plan, including the assurance objectives 
identified. The Committee reviews the results of completed audits 
and observations from other ongoing assurance and control 
improvement support, as well as actions taken by management 
in response to Internal Audit’s work.

The functional effectiveness of Internal Audit is assessed on an 
ongoing basis and reported to the Committee throughout the 
year. During 2023, this involved an independent external quality 
assessment of the function. The Committee reviewed and 
considered the conclusions of the external assessment, with 
particular focus on the future methodology and capabilities 
required for the function, including the use of external expertise.

Governance and compliance 
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Group’s Code 
of Conduct and related policies.

Looking forward
During 2024, the Committee will remain focused on the Group’s 
internal control and risk management environment and approach to 
financial reporting. In doing so, the Committee will take into account 
developments in reporting responsibilities, including those relating 
to changes in the UK Corporate Governance Code and other 
regulatory requirements.

External Auditor – reappointment of PwC
The Committee reviewed and assessed PwC’s performance during 
the year and considered its reappointment as the Group’s external 
Auditor. PwC was originally appointed as the Group’s Auditor in 
March 2021, following a tender process in 2019. Giles Hannam 
remained as PwC’s lead audit partner in 2023. 

The Committee regularly reviewed and assessed the progress of the 
audit throughout the year and also undertook a detailed effectiveness 
assessment through two surveys; one for Committee members and 
the other for senior management.

The surveys focused on the following areas:

•  the quality and service of the audit team;

•  audit planning and execution;

•  communication with the Committee and senior management;

•  contribution to process controls and financial reporting; and

•  the independence and objectivity of the Auditors.

The responses to the surveys were positive and noted in particular 
that the PwC audit team had developed a clear audit plan that was 
effectively communicated, demonstrated strong technical expertise 
and provided constructive challenge.

During 2023, the Committee also agreed with PwC that reporting 
would be provided against a series of audit quality indicators to 
support the Committee’s assessment of audit quality. This reporting 
was provided for the first time in February 2024.

Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the PwC audit team 
was providing the required quality in its provision of audit services 
and maintained appropriate levels of independence and objectivity. 
The Committee therefore recommended the continued 
appointment of PwC to the Board.

The Group has complied with the requirements of the Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and 
governance of tenders for the appointment of the external Auditor 
and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services.

Given the unique nature of the System Fund, 
the Committee reviews the controls and 
processes related to System Fund accounting.

The Committee reviewed the deferred revenue balance, the 
valuation approach, the results of the external actuarial review and 
procedures completed to determine the breakage assumption for 
outstanding IHG One Rewards points. 

The Committee reviewed management’s papers supporting the 
removal of an adjustment made in recent years that placed more 
emphasis on pre-Covid-19 redemption behaviours.

The Committee concluded that the deferred revenue balance 
is appropriately stated.

The Committee met with senior finance management to review 
and evaluate the risk areas associated with the System Fund.

The Committee reviewed a paper from management summarising 
the principles determining the allocation of revenues and expenses 
to the System Fund and the related governance and internal control 
environment. The Committee concluded that the accounting 
treatment of the System Fund and related disclosures are appropriate.

Impairment testing

Litigation and 
contingencies

Exceptional items

Judgement is applied in assessing whether 
triggering events for impairment testing 
of assets or cash-generating units have 
occurred. The Committee scrutinises the 
methodologies applied and the potential 
for asset impairment or impairment reversal.

The Committee reviewed management reports outlining the 
approach taken on impairment testing and key assumptions and 
sensitivities supporting the conclusion on the various asset 
categories. The Committee examined in detail whether triggering 
events for impairment testing had occurred. The Committee agreed 
with the determinations reached on impairment.

From time to time, the Group is subject 
to legal proceedings with the ultimate 
outcome of each being subject to many 
uncertainties. The Committee reviews and 
evaluates the need for provisioning and 
considers the adequacy of the disclosure.

At each meeting during the year, the Committee considered reports 
detailing all material litigation matters including commercial 
disputes. The Committee discussed and agreed any provisioning 
requirements based on underlying factors. Disclosures were 
assessed, with particular emphasis on the completeness of 
uncertainties disclosed. 

The Committee reviewed papers by management and considered 
the consistency of treatment and nature of items classified as 
exceptional. The Committee reviewed and challenged the significance, 
timing and nature of the exceptional items (see pages 179 to 180). 
The Committee also considered the sufficiency of disclosure and 
whether such disclosure explained the rationale for why each item 
is considered to be exceptional. The Committee concluded that the 
disclosures and the treatment of the items shown as exceptional 
are appropriate. 

The Committee reviewed and challenged the scenarios considered 
by management, the detailed cash flow forecasts and the mitigating 
actions available to management considered in its going concern 
assessment to June 2025 and the three-year viability assessment 
and concluded these were appropriate. The Committee also reviewed 
and challenged the reverse stress test assumptions to confirm the 
viability of the Group. The Committee reviewed going concern 
disclosures (page 161) and the viability statement (pages 50 and 51) 
and is satisfied these are appropriate.

The Committee reviewed an analysis from management 
summarising the approach taken to consider climate risk in the 
Group Financial Statements and concluded that the disclosures 
were appropriate. The Committee agreed that the disclosures made 
in respect of the TCFD were appropriate. The Committee satisfied 
itself that the approach across the Annual Report has been 
proportionate and consistent.

The Group exercises judgement in presenting 
exceptional items. The Committee reviews 
and challenges the classification of items 
as exceptional based on their size, nature 
or incidence, with consideration given to 
consistency of treatment with prior years 
and between gains and losses.

Going concern 
and viability

The Committee reviews management’s 
financial modelling to conclude on the 
appropriateness of the going concern 
and viability statement.

Climate risk

In preparing the Group Financial Statements, 
the potential impacts of climate change 
have been considered.

Area for focus

Issue/Role of the Committee

Conclusions/Actions taken

UK deferred 
tax asset

Given the size of the Group’s UK deferred 
tax asset ($113m), the Committee reviewed 
and challenged the key assumptions 
determining the recoverability of the 
deferred tax asset and whether this should 
be disclosed as a significant estimate.

Financial Statement 
disclosures

The Committee considers the 
appropriateness of disclosures in the Group 
Financial Statements. 

The Committee confirmed the estimates used to support the recovery 
of the UK deferred tax asset were consistent with those used in the 
impairment and going concern and viability assessments. Given the 
recovery to levels of profitability assumed in these estimates, the 
Committee concluded that it agreed with the recognition of the 
deferred tax asset, that this was not a significant estimate, as a 
material change in estimate is not expected in the next 12 months, 
and that the disclosures are appropriate.

The Committee reviewed disclosures required on adoption of IFRS 
17 ‘Insurance Contracts’. The Committee also reviewed management’s 
proposals to improve the clarity and succinctness of the Group 
Financial Statements by omitting immaterial disclosures and 
combining disclosures around System Fund and reimbursable 
expenses in certain areas of the Financial Statements. The Committee 
concluded that the disclosures to the Group Financial Statements 
are appropriate and proportional.

Voice of the Employee

As IHG’s designated Non-Executive Director (NED) with 
responsibility for workforce engagement (Voice of the 
Employee), Duriya Farooqui, supported by the Group’s 
Global HR team, held a series of employee interface sessions 
throughout the year to engage directly with members of 
IHG’s corporate and hotel workforces, with the aim of 
sharing feedback with the Board for consideration in its 
decision-making. 

Role and responsibilities 
The role and responsibilities of the designated Voice of the 
Employee NED are to: 

•  support the design of the structure and content of Board 

discussions on employee engagement and culture;

•  evaluate employee engagement approaches and their 

effectiveness;

•  ensure that employee feedback and interests are factored 

into the Board’s decisions and KPI setting;

•  ensure that the Board, through the Executive Committee, 

has effective methods of receiving feedback from employees 
and communicating Board and executive decisions and 
priorities throughout the organisation;

•  ensure all significant business and budget proposals include 
a management assessment of the impact on employees; and

•  ensure executives share employee feedback openly, 

transparently and in a balanced way, including reviewing 
employee engagement surveys and other employee reports, 
including whistleblowing. 

2023 engagement 
Throughout 2023, Duriya, with the participation of several other 
NEDs and Chair Deanna Oppenheimer, hosted fifteen employee 
interface meetings to engage with a cross-section of employees 
and received detailed feedback. These feedback sessions, which 
were a mix of in person and virtual meetings/forums, included 
leader groups within the US and UK hotels, reservations and 
corporate populations, and ERGs across the UK, US, India, China 
and various EMEAA countries as well as colleagues who have 
recently joined the organisation. 

Discussion topics and themes in relation to the feedback received 
from employees included: workplace culture; leader 
communications; strategy, prioritisation and collaboration; 
talent attraction; onboarding and retention; personal and career 
development; technology and systems; and agile ways of working 
and decision-making.

Additional engagement and activities undertaken by Duriya, 
the Chair of the Board, and other NEDs during the year included:

•  monitoring and reviewing the content and feedback from global 

‘all employee’ CEO calls; 

•  reviewing employee engagement survey results; 

•  engaging with the Global HR Leadership team to receive 

broader cultural insights; and 

•  engaging directly with senior leaders at Board and Committee 

meetings, the Board strategy event and the Group’s senior 
leaders’ meeting.

Insights and learnings
Duriya provided regular feedback to the Responsible Business 
Committee and the Board throughout the year, with key Board 
discussions taking place around the insights as well as action 
planning arising from employee engagement survey results. 

Plans for 2024
Duriya will remain as the Board member with responsibility for 
workforce engagement in 2024, assisted by additional NEDs.

A schedule of discussions and feedback sessions has been 
arranged for 2024 and will continue to encompass a wide group 
of employees and leaders from across all regions, including ERGs, 
Lean In Circles and new starters. The discussion topics will be 
tailored to specifically focus on those areas that support the 
strategy. Additionally, the Board will continue to keep the 
functioning of the Voice of the Employee programme under 
review to ensure it meets best practice and complies with 
regulatory developments.

Key duties and role of the Committee
Key objectives and summary of responsibilities
The Committee reviews the composition of the Board and its 
Principal Committees, evaluating the balance of skills, experience, 
independence, knowledge and diversity requirements before 
making appropriate recommendations to the Board as to any 
changes. It also ensures plans are in place for orderly succession 
both for Directors and other senior executives, and is responsible 
for reviewing the Group’s senior leadership needs.

The Committee’s role, responsibilities and authority delegated to it 
by the Board, including processes in relation to appointments, are 
set out in its Terms of Reference (ToR), which are reviewed annually 
and approved by the Board. The ToR state that the Committee is 
responsible for considering potential candidates for appointment 
to the Board based on merit, cognitive and personal strengths with 
due regard for the benefits of diversity, including gender and social, 
ethnic and geographic backgrounds.

  The ToR are available at ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate governance.

The Committee’s key responsibilities and focus areas during the year 
have been:

•  assessing the composition of the Board and the Principal 

Committees and succession planning, including consideration of 
gender balance and ethnic and geographical diversity, in accordance 
with the ToR and consistent with the Group’s Global Diversity, 
Equity, Inclusion and Equal Opportunities Policy (DE&I Policy);

•  engaging with external search consultancies and making 

recommendations on appointments to the Board;

•  overseeing the external performance evaluation of the Board and 
its Principal Committees as well as the evaluation of individual 
Non-Executive Directors; and

•  monitoring the Executive Committee and senior leadership talent 

and succession planning.

Membership and attendance at meetings
The Committee’s membership and attendance at meetings 
are available on page 96. All members of the Committee are 
Non-Executive Directors. When the Committee considers matters 
relating to the Chair of the Nomination Committee position, the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID) acts as 
Committee Chair.

With regard to both searches, desktop reviews were conducted 
to identify suitable candidates for the roles. Shortlisted candidates 
met with various members of the Board and management as relevant, 
with assessments being made on the appropriate competencies, 
functional experience, cultural characteristics and consideration 
of candidates’ other commitments in line with the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.

Following completion of an interview process and reference and 
background checks, the Committee recommended to the Board the 
appointment of Angie Risley as Non-Executive Director and Chair 
Designate of the Remuneration Committee, which was approved 
by the Board with effect from 1 September 2023. 

Likewise, following similar completion of an interview process and 
reference and background checks, the Committee recommended 
to the Board the appointment of Ron Kalifa as Non-Executive 
Director, which was approved by the Board with effect from 
1 January 2024.

Executive Committee talent and succession
Throughout the year, the Committee also received updates on 
talent and succession planning at Executive Committee and senior 
leadership levels, noting in particular progress against 
DE&I objectives.

Information on the gender and ethnicity balance of the Board and 
the Executive Committee is included on page 99. Information on the 
gender and ethnicity balance of senior management is included on 
pages 30 and 31. 

The Group’s DE&I Policy applies in respect of the Board and its 
Principal Committees. The DE&I Policy aims to create a diverse 
culture and support diversity and inclusion. When assessing and 
considering succession planning at Board and Executive Committee 
levels, the Committee takes diversity considerations into account 
consistent with the DE&I Policy. The DE&I Policy aligns to the 
Group’s responsible business commitments and a description of 
progress against these commitments is included in the 2023 DE&I 
Progress Report, available at ihgplc.com/Responsible Business 
under Reporting.

Looking forward
In 2024, the Committee will continue to ensure that we have 
appropriate plans in place for orderly succession of appointments to 
the Board and to senior management, so that an appropriate balance 
of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity is maintained.

Reporting to the Board
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board for all Board 
appointments. Minutes are circulated to and reviewed by Committee 
members, and the Committee Chair reports back to the Board on 
the activities of the Committee following each meeting.

Effectiveness of the Committee and External Evaluation
During 2023, the Committee was reviewed as part of the external 
Board evaluation process. Details of the external evaluation, including 
how it was conducted, the nature and extent of the evaluator’s 
contact with the Board and the actions arising from the evaluation, 
are set out on pages 104 to 106. The Committee concluded that it 
remains effective and succeeds at ensuring that the right number 
and mix of directors with appropriate core skills are brought onto 
the Board. Succession planning at Executive Committee and senior 
management level was identified as an area for continued focus.

Focus areas and activities
Executive Director succession planning 
An overview of the CFO succession process, following which 
Michael Glover was appointed as CFO, was included in last year’s 
Nomination Committee Report on page 113 of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022.

During 2023, the Committee oversaw the CEO succession process 
and the appointment of Elie Maalouf as CEO.

The Committee explored both internal and external candidates for 
the CEO role. A desktop review of possible external candidates was 
conducted by Spencer Stuart; the Chair also met with members 
of the Executive Committee to assess career aspirations and CEO 
capabilities. The Committee considered in particular the relative 
merits of internal and external candidates.

Following the interview process, including a presentation by 
Elie Maalouf to, and discussion with, all Non-Executive Directors, 
the Committee concluded that it should recommend to the Board 
the appointment of Elie as CEO.

The Committee also oversaw induction plans for both Michael and 
Elie in respect of their new roles. Further details of the induction 
plans are provided on page 104.

Board and Principal Committee composition 
and succession planning
The Committee continued to maintain and review throughout the 
year a Board skills matrix and a Board refreshment schedule, which 
track the skills, competencies and experiences of the Board members 
and provide an overview of the Board’s tenure, gender, ethnicity and 
Committee assignment considerations. These helped to inform 
future Board appointments and rotations.

Using this resource, and in anticipation of Jo Harlow reaching a 
nine-year term during the year, the Committee led the process to 
recruit a new Remuneration Committee Chair.

In addition, the Committee determined that the Board would benefit 
from recent CEO experience and further expertise in the technology 
and digital sector. Accordingly, the Committee initiated a search for 
an additional Non-Executive Director to meet this profile.

Spencer Stuart was engaged in connection with the Remuneration 
Committee Chair search (as well as the CEO succession) and 
Heidrick & Struggles was engaged in connection with the other 
Non-Executive Director search. Neither Spencer Stuart nor Heidrick 
& Struggles has any other connection with the Company or any 
individual Directors.

room signings) resulted in awards for Executive Directors of 81.8% 
of maximum reflecting the strong performance of the business 
in 2023;

•  the outcome of the 2021/23 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) award 
cycle, covering the three years from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 
2023, was 57.8% of maximum. The business continued to deliver 
exceptional absolute cash flow management and strong growth 
in relative net system size growth (NSSG). For the first time since 
the 2018/20 cycle, the business also achieved above threshold 
performance over three years against our peers in relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR); 

•  the total average of short- and long-term incentive plan awards 
for the respective period ending 2023 was therefore 67.9% of 
maximum for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Elie Maalouf; and

•  the Committee reviewed the performance outcomes in line with 

the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (DR Policy) and its framework for 
assessing discretion and found no rationale for applying discretion 
to the formulaic outcomes of the 2023 APP and 2021/23 LTIP. 

Directors’ Remuneration Policy – shareholder engagement
We received shareholder approval for our updated DR Policy at 
the 5 May 2023 AGM. The full DR Policy can be found in our 2023 
Notice of AGM and is also summarised on page 121 of this report. 
Ahead of the vote, we directly engaged with owners of around 60% 
of the share capital of the Company and we were pleased that the 
majority of our shareholders supported our new policy. The votes 
of 74.85% in favour of the DR Policy and 76.94% in favour of the 
DRR both represented slightly less than 80% support and, as such, 
Jo Harlow and I met a range of shareholders within a six-month 
window after the AGM vote, as required by the Corporate Governance 
Code. We met with holders of more than 25% of share capital, 
including both those who voted for and against the DR Policy and 
DRR, as well as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and the 
Investment Association. The main points of discussion were:

•  introducing myself as the incoming Remuneration Committee 

Chair with effect from 1 January 2024;

•  following up on comments and concerns on the 2022 DRR and the 

2023 DR Policy; and

•  the new CEO pay arrangements, as set out in the notice published 

following the appointment of Elie Maalouf. 

In these meetings, we heard strong levels of support for the 2023 DR 
Policy and an understanding of the competitive executive pay context, 
consistent with what we had heard in our pre-AGM meetings. For those 
shareholders who had voted against the DRR and DR Policy, the 
rationale commonly related to internal voting guidelines that formed 
red lines for specific DR Policy features, which were not related to the

•  128  Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration

On behalf of the Board, I am delighted to represent the 
Remuneration Committee (the Committee) as Chair and present 
my first Directors’ Remuneration Report (DRR) for the year ended 
31 December 2023. I joined the IHG Board as a Non-Executive 
Director in September 2023, and assumed the role of Chair of the 
Committee on 1 January 2024. I would like to thank my predecessor, 
Jo Harlow, who has successfully overseen the Committee through 
periods of significant change and increasing focus on the Executive 
Remuneration landscape, for her leadership and valuable years of 
service in the role, and for the robust and thorough handover which 
ensured a seamless transition. I would also like to thank all of the 
shareholders I have met so far for their time, insight and support.

2023 business performance context
Guest demand grew again during 2023 as appetite for travel 
continued to improve. We passed the milestone of 6,300 open 
hotels in delivering net system size growth of 3.8% for the year. 
Operating profit from reportable segments, at $1,019 million, 
was up 23% on 2022. Strong growth in revenue combined with our 
disciplined approach to cost management resulted in a 3.4%pts 
improvement in fee margin to 59.3%. From a shareholder perspective, 
we have seen continued growth in shareholder value with the Board 
proposing a final dividend of 104.0¢, representing a growth of 10% 
on 2022, and resulting in a total dividend for the year of 152.3¢. 
Additionally, as a result of strong cash management, we completed 
a share buyback programme to return $750 million of surplus capital 
in December 2023, and a further $800 million programme has been 
approved for 2024.

Overview of 2023 remuneration outcomes
The key highlights of Executive Director incentive plan awards for 
2023 are presented below, and the awards reflect our strong 
business performance during 2023:

•  the achievement on Annual Performance Plan (APP) metrics

increase in LTIP quantum for Executive Directors, and which differed 
by shareholder. The increase in LTIP quantum was thoroughly 
discussed and explained in the consultations leading up to the 
approval of the 2023 DR Policy at the 2023 AGM and in our follow up 
discussions, and was well understood and supported by shareholders, 
based on the transparent benchmarking of the hotel industry. 

In the context of this feedback, and the overall level of support for 
the DR Policy (at almost 75%), the Committee concluded that the 
DR Policy changes reflected the supportive views of a significant 
majority of shareholders, who continue to agree that the commercial 
rationale for the DR Policy changes is critical to the retention and 
development of global talent in order to drive the long-term success 
of the business. Feedback on votes against the DRR indicated that 
these related either to the use of discretion on the LTIP 2020/22 
cash flow outcome or to other shareholder-specific concerns. 
The Committee considers that the 76.94% voting level demonstrated 
strong support for their view that the outcome reflected the 
exceptional performance of the Executive Directors in managing 
cash flow during the pandemic.

Having met with more shareholders in January 2024, their support 
of IHG’s continuous need to improve the competitiveness of 
Executive Director pay was evident. The Board is of the view that 
further changes to Executive Director pay will need to be considered 
in order to help protect our Executive Director retention and talent 
pipeline, which are key for successful future business growth.

  The approved DR Policy is available on IHG’s website at 
ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate governance.

Board changes
The business criticality of attracting and retaining high performing 
Executive Directors and their succession pipeline has been highlighted 
in the departures of the Chief Financial Officer & Group Head of 
Strategy and the Group Chief Executive Officer during 2023. It is 
vital to IHG’s continued growth that the quality of talent existing 
in our current Executive Director team is reflected in our internal 
and external candidates for succession. The vast majority of our 
competitors are based in the US, therefore the corresponding talent 
market is US-based. There remains a significant difference between 
our CEO pay level and that of our US competitors, as well as differences 
in the structure and mix of incentives, and the Committee will remain 
focused and will continue to engage with shareholders going forward 
on how this can be addressed in the context of retaining existing 
talent and developing and retaining successor talent. 

As announced by the Company on 5 May 2023 and the s430(2B) 
of the Companies Act 2006 declaration released on 28 June 2023, 
Keith Barr stepped down from the role of CEO, and from the Board, 
on 30 June 2023. The Committee exercised its discretion to treat 
Keith Barr as a ‘good leaver’, in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of applicable incentive and share plan rules. Elie Maalouf 
succeeded Keith Barr as CEO with effect from 1 July 2023. Elie was 
already a member of IHG’s Board and had been leading IHG’s 
Americas business as regional CEO for eight years.

Historically, our succession strategy has generally been to grow 
executive level successors within the business, particularly in the US. 
Whilst we remain focused on maintaining our ability to secure a strong 
executive level internal succession pipeline, this has become more 
challenging in recent years as those potential successors move to 
positions outside IHG offering more attractive packages at their level 
and above, both in terms of structure (for example, restricted stock 
units) and quantum. The ability to attract Elie Maalouf into the role 
of CEO has enabled us to secure a leader with significant US market 
experience and who continues to maintain key government and 
industry relationships in the US, as well as having an in-depth global 
knowledge of IHG. We are committed to ensuring that there remains 
a robust succession plan in place at executive level. 

We shared remuneration details for Elie Maalouf upon his 
appointment in a voluntary published statement in July 2023, 
as well as in discussions with shareholders in October 2023. 
In our AGM follow-up meetings, strong support was expressed by 
shareholders regarding the way in which succession planning had 
been conducted, as well as for the pay arrangements for Elie, with 
recognition of the competitive challenges we face operating across 
UK and US markets, where pay structures vary substantially.

Elie’s annual base salary of £990,000 represents a 7% increase 
on that of his predecessor; the outgoing CEO Keith Barr would 
have received an estimated 4% increase to his salary in April 2024, 
reducing the difference to 2.9%. Furthermore, Elie will not be subject 
to a salary review until April 2025. We estimate that Elie’s full year 
CEO single total figure of remuneration will not exceed that of Keith 
Barr’s until 2025. Elie’s remuneration remains proportionate in the 
context of both the international hotel peer company and FTSE 100, 
and follows our strategy of growing successor talent in-house. 
The Board is fully supportive of the salary positioning in this context. 
External US recruitment would have involved a more significant pay 
increase and an externally recruited CEO, who would have not yet 
been tested in the IHG environment, would have represented a 
greater risk with less proven value. Full details of the remuneration 
arrangements for Elie Maalouf’s changes are in line with the approved 
DR Policy and can be found on page 126. 

As reported in the 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson stepped down from the role of Chief 
Financial Officer & Group Head of Strategy, and from the Board, 
and left IHG on 19 March 2023. Michael Glover succeeded Paul 
as Chief Financial Officer (CFO), effective 20 March 2023. We were 
delighted to be able to appoint someone with Michael’s expertise 
and experience. He has held several roles in his 18 years at IHG, 
including CFO of IHG’s China region, Group Financial Controller, and 
his most recent role as CFO Americas with group-wide responsibility 
for commercial finance operations.

Jill McDonald and Ian Dyson both stepped down from the Board 
as Non-Executive Directors on 28 February 2023. Subsequently, 
Graham Allan was appointed Chair of the Responsible Business 
Committee and Byron Grote was appointed Chair of the Audit 
Committee; both appointments took effect on 1 March 2023. I was 
appointed to the Board with effect from 1 September 2023, with 
membership of the Remuneration and Responsible Business 
Committees from that date, and assumed the Remuneration 
Committee Chair role on 1 January 2024. Sir Ron Kalifa joined the 
Board, with effect from 1 January 2024, becoming a member of the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees. The remuneration arrangements 
in respect of all changes were in line with the approved DR Policy 
and are covered on pages 126 and 127.

Wider workforce remuneration and employee engagement
The Committee is extremely mindful of ongoing inflationary pressures 
across many of our markets and its impact on the financial and 
emotional wellbeing of our employees. In 2023, salary increases for 
the UK and US corporate populations were above that for the CEO in 
role at the time. The overall average budget for 2024 increases is 4% 
for our global corporate workforce, with total budgets in the UK and 
the US being 4.2% and 3.6% respectively. The CEO is not eligible to 
receive a merit increase for 2024 following his appointment in July 
2023, as explained above. We have also made an additional 15% 
available to the budgeted amount for the personal performance 
element of our 2023 Annual Performance Plan to increase bonus 
amounts for our strongest performers. 

For the UK leased hotel estate, in agreement with the owner, budgeted 
2023 salary increases ranged from 5% to 8%, with higher increases 
applicable for frontline employees, and one-off payments made to 
employees in 2023 for those who had worked for at least the final 
three months of 2022. Budgeted 2024 salary increases range from 
3% to 13% with higher increases applicable for frontline employees.

The Real Living Wage will be applied for 12 months from April 2024, 
as a minimum for all staff, in line with the Real Living Wage Foundation 
level, and zero-hour contracts are not utilised in the UK leased estate.

 – The TSR comparator group has been expanded from 8 to 15 
global hotel companies. Details of the new TSR comparator 
group can be found on pages 138 and 140.

In 2023, we also introduced a salary sacrifice electric car scheme 
for UK corporate colleagues, enhanced maternity and paternity 
pay for our UK managed hotels, and partnered with Busy Bees to 
provide both our UK corporate colleagues and our UK managed 
hotels a 20% discount on childcare fees. Further details of our 
approach to remuneration across the wider workforce, in general 
and throughout the year, are outlined on pages 123 to 124.

We were pleased to see overall employee engagement scores 
remain resilient at 87%, exceeding external benchmarks by 10%. 
Perceptions of pay also remained strong, exceeding external 
benchmarks across our hotel, reservations and general manager 
populations (see page 124). It is also pleasing to see that we have 
reduced our Gender Pay gap in the UK by 16% since 2017. I look 
forward to participating in some employee engagement sessions 
during 2024, as noted on page 127, and hearing views about 
remuneration more generally.

Implementation of Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2024
As covered in more detail on pages 138 to 140:

•  With regards to salary increases for Executive Directors, as 

mentioned above, the CEO will not receive an increase in 2024; 
the CFO will receive an increase in line with that of the  
global corporate workforce following an assessment of 
2023 performance. 

•  The non-financial measures for the 2024 Annual Performance Plan 
will remain as room openings and room signings, aligned to our 
key strategic objectives for our future growth priorities, and the 
financial measure will remain as operating profit from reportable 
segments, as in 2023. 

•  LTIP 2024/26 cycle measures will remain as relative TSR, relative 

net system size growth, absolute cash flow, adjusted earnings per 
share and ESG. Retaining the same balance of measures for the 
2024/26 cycle maintains an overall business performance focus.

 – New ESG metrics have been implemented, with environmental 
metrics based on Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) and 
hotels that operate at low/zero carbon, as key areas in 
management control that support delivery of our carbon and 
energy goals. New People measures build on our 2023/25 LTIP 
representation targets. The new measures focus on quantitative 
targets in relation to driving greater inclusion and growing our 
next generation of hotel general managers from our talent 
pipelines. The Committee considers this innovative approach to 
People measures to be relevant and appropriate for the Company 
and fully aligned to our priorities in this area. See pages 139 and 
140 for more details.

•  Retirement benefits for incumbent UK Executive Directors will 

continue to align with the maximum company contribution available 
to all other participants in the UK Pension plan.

 Certain KPIs and Non-GAAP measures are used throughout the Directors’ Remuneration Report. See pages 84 to 88 for additional detail. 

Use of Non-GAAP measures: in addition to performance measures directly observable in the Group Financial Statements (IFRS measures), 
additional financial measures (described as Non-GAAP) are presented that are used internally by management as key measures to assess 
performance. Non-GAAP measures are either not defined under IFRS or are adjusted IFRS figures. Further explanation in relation to these 
measures can be found on pages 84 to 88 and reconciliations to IFRS figures, where they have been adjusted, are on pages 226 to 228.

Executive Director remuneration

2023 actual remuneration vs potential remuneration
The charts below show the 2023 potential remuneration opportunity and actual achievement compared to the 2022 actual achievement. 
The relevant figures for each of the elements that make up the single total figure of remuneration, as shown below for the Executive Directors, 
can be found in the table on page 128. See above for the key to individual elements of actual remuneration for 2022 and 2023.

For the purpose of reading the charts below, please note the following:

•  Elie Maalouf’s 2023 figures are a combined total based on his CEO, Americas role for the 1 January to 30 June period and Group CEO role 

for the 1 July to 31 December period.

•  For Michael Glover, we have not shown 2022 figures as he was promoted to the Board on 20 March 2023 and was not an Executive 

Director for the 2022 period. His 2023 figures are based on fixed pay and APP for the period 20 March to 31 December and LTIP for the full 
2021/23 cycle.

•  The one-off relocation payments made to Elie Maalouf and Michael Glover in 2023 have been included within their benefits figure for the 

purpose of the charts below. The respective amounts have been disclosed in the Other column of the single total figure table on page 128.

•  For both Keith Barr and Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson, their 2023 actual and potential figures are based on the period in which they were 

Executive Directors only (1 January-30 June 2023 for Keith Barr; and 1 January-19 March 2023 for Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson).

How we performed in 2023

The Company delivered another year of strong performance against target in operating profit from reportable segments. Room openings 
were below target this year and room signings narrowly missed target, by less than one percent, however, both these measures achieved 
well above threshold performance. In the round, this meant the formulaic 2023 APP achievement was 142.2% of target, resulting in awards 
for Executive Directors of 163.5% of salary (81.8% of the capped maximum award). Under the LTIP, improved TSR performance against 
comparators resulted in the vesting of this element for the first time since the 2018/20 cycle. This, combined with a solid net system size 
growth performance relative to our largest competitors and an exceptional management of cash flow, resulted in a formulaic outcome of 
57.8% of maximum. Further details on the actual achievement for operating profit from reportable segments and absolute cash flow can 
be found on pages 128 and 129.

be made in 50% cash and 50% 
shares deferred for three years.

The maximum potential LTIP 
quantum is 500% of salary for the 
CEO and US Executive Directors, 
and up to 300% of salary for other

The guideline shareholding 
requirement is 500% for the CEO 
and US Executive Directors and 
300% for other Executive Directors. 
In respect of the post-employment 
shareholding requirement, the full 
guideline shareholding requirement 
will normally continue for two years 
post-cessation of employment.

  A copy of the DR Policy, approved in May 2023, is available on IHG’s website at ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate Governance.

The Committee has considered the remuneration policy and practices in the context of Provision 40 of the UK Corporate Governance Code:

Principle

Clarity 

IHG’s approach

Through the combination of short- and long-term incentive plan measures, the DR Policy is structured to support financial objectives and 
the strategic priorities of the business that deliver shareholder returns and long-term value creation. Further alignment with shareholder 
interests is driven by the significant proportion of share-based incentives and Executive Director shareholding requirements. Our reward 
policies are aligned throughout the organisation and include a proportion of performance-related reward, driving engagement for the whole 
of the workforce. We always seek to report our DR Policy and performance-related remuneration measures, targets and outcomes in a clear, 
transparent and balanced way, with relevant and timely communication with all of our stakeholders, including shareholders. 

Simplicity

Our remuneration structure comprises straightforward and well-understood components. The purpose, structure and strategic alignment 
of each element is clearly laid out in the remuneration policy summary table:

•  fixed pay: base salary, pension and benefits that are consistent with role and location and are designed to attract and retain talent;

•  short-term incentive: annual performance-related bonus which incentivises and rewards the delivery of financial and non-financial 

strategic objectives. For senior employees, a proportion of this bonus is paid in cash and the remainder deferred in shares for a period 
of at least three years; and

•  long-term incentive: a share-based award which incentivises performance over a three-year period based on measures that drive 

long-term sustainable growth and value creation.

Principle

IHG’s approach

Predictability

The range of possible values of rewards for Executive Directors is clearly disclosed in graphical form both at the time of approving the policy 
and in the annual implementation report.

Risk

Our DR Policy contains a number of elements to ensure that it drives the right behaviours to incentivise the Executive Directors to deliver 
long-term sustainable growth and shareholder returns and to reward them appropriately:

•  the maximum short- and long-term incentive awards are capped as a % of salary;

•  the Committee has clear discretion policies, linked to specific measures where necessary, to override formulaic outcomes;

•  Executive Directors agree to clear and comprehensive malus and clawback provisions; and

•  significant shareholding requirements apply for Executive Directors, including the deferral of 30% to 50% of bonus in shares; a two-year 

post-vest holding period for LTIP shares and minimum shareholding requirements both during and after employment.

Proportionality

Individual rewards are aligned to the delivery of strategic business objectives. The Committee sets robust and stretching targets to ensure 
that there is a clear link between the performance of the Group and the awards made to Executive Directors and others.

Alignment 
to culture 

IHG has a clear purpose and well-established values and behaviours. The alignment between remuneration incentives and our strategy for 
relentless focus on growth, and the KPIs that underpin the delivery of our strategy, is outlined below. Other elements of reward, such as 
salary reviews and, across the wider workforce, the short-term incentive plan and our global recognition scheme, reward employees for 
performance and actions that demonstrate our values and behaviours.

•  The strength and breadth of our portfolio, tailored services 
and solutions, as well as our technology and platforms drive 
consumer preference, owner returns and rooms growth; 
all contributing to our revenues and profit.

•  Openings and signings are two of our key drivers of system 
size and central to our strategy of accelerating the growth 
of our brands in high-value markets.

•  Performance on Global Metrics, including key ESG measures 
(Employee Engagement, Guest Love, Responsible Business), 
will be reviewed in considering the potential application 
of discretion to formulaic outcomes on APP strategic 
objective measures.

•  Our strategy is intended to deliver unmatched guest 

experiences and unrivalled owner returns for our stakeholders, 
including competitive total shareholder returns.

•  Our strategy is to accelerate the growth of our brands in 

high-value markets by using our global scale and expertise 
so it is important that this forms a key element of our 
management team’s Long Term Incentive Plan.

•  Enhancing our customer and owner offer and accelerating the 
growth of our brands in high-value markets drives sustained 
growth in cash flows and profits over the long term, which can 
be reinvested in our business and returned to shareholders.

•  Aligned to our people, communities, and planet strategy, 

new ESG measures (decarbonisation, and diversity, equity 
and inclusion) are included in our LTIP targets.

•  EPS provides a measure of the efficiency of the capital 
structure, as well as promoting further alignment with 
shareholder experience and value.

Remuneration at IHG – the wider context

Our reward philosophy

Our reward arrangements are competitive, drive creation of value for stakeholders and make 
us think and act as one team.

How our reward practices are aligned across all levels of the organisation
Our approach to fairness in reward is an important aspect of our overall reward philosophy and is designed to attract, retain, motivate and 
engage top talent. It is supported by a robust governance approach that ensures our reward and recognition practices are fair and consistent 
across our employee and colleague population, regardless of gender and other aspects of diversity, as well as an alignment between the wider 
direct workforce and executive remuneration. We regularly review our approach externally, ensuring we are competitive in the different 
markets in which we operate and meet the needs of employees by offering market-driven reward packages.

In the 2023 base salary review process, we continued to put our managers at the heart of the process, allowing them 
to use their discretion in pay decisions. We also included an additional 25% on top of the standard merit budget in order 
to address equity and recognise talent. With continuous improvements on our external benchmarking capability, we 
provided additional line manager support with market data analysis and guidance so that the budget could be targeted 
in areas where it would have the most impact. Our managers are reminded of our diversity, equity and inclusion statement 
on making fair reward decisions consistent with our Code of Conduct to ensure all employees are rewarded fairly and 
according to their contribution, skills and experience, with tips on avoiding any conscious and unconscious bias. 
For 2024, an additional merit budget will again be made available to address individual equity and talent recognition.

In 2023, we introduced an electric car salary sacrifice scheme allowing UK corporate colleagues to obtain an electric 
car and receive both tax and national insurance savings, whilst at the same time supporting our Journey to Tomorrow 
environmental commitments. So far, 5.8% of those eligible for the scheme have ordered vehicles to date, which is 16.8% 
of those who have registered interest in the scheme. We also understand the demands faced by working parents and 
carers when it comes to balancing their work and home life, so we partnered with Busy Bees to provide our UK corporate 
colleagues, along with our UK managed hotels, a 20% discount on childcare fees. A key element of our employer brand 
and beloved colleague benefits is our Employee Room Rate programme, which enables employees to book hotels across 
many of our brands at a reduced rate. This year, we enabled colleagues to earn IHG One Reward points on Employee Rate 
stays, and are working on additional enhancements to the programme in the future. The levels of healthcare cover on 
offer in the UK continued to align across all UK corporate colleagues.

UK: the contribution rate for corporate and eligible hotel employees in the IHG UK pension plan is aligned across the 
eligible population with a 2:1 matching ratio up to a maximum of 6% of salary from employees and 12% from the Company. 

US: US retirement saving plans are made up of a 401(k) plan which has a 1:1 matching contribution ratio up to a maximum 
of 6% of salary for eligible corporate employees and a Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) that provides for supplementary 
company contributions of up to 16% provided at senior levels (a historic grandfathered rate of 20% applies for a small 
number of employees who were already receiving this rate when it was removed effective 1 January 2017).

   Annual 
Performance 
Plan (APP) 

All

All corporate employees share the same corporate performance metrics with the Executive Committee and Executive 
Directors. For senior management (generally at Executive Committee (EC) level and their direct reports), a proportion of 
bonus is deferred into shares for a three-year period. The weightings of metrics for all corporate employees below EC 
level are aligned and a greater portion of an award can be achieved through an employee’s individual performance and 
contribution to the Company. In addition, in view of the strong performance in 2023, approximately 15% is being added 
to the amount budgeted for the personal performance element to increase awards for those employees who performed 
the strongest during 2023.

   Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(LTIP)

Executive 
Directors 
and senior 
management

Senior/mid-management and certain specialist roles are eligible to participate in a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). 
Performance-based LTIP awards largely apply at the level of Executive Committee and their direct reports; Restricted 
Stock Units typically apply for eligible employees below this level (see below). In 2023, at the same time as levels for 
Executive Directors were increased under the new DR Policy, LTIP levels for senior management were adjusted for market 
competitiveness and to better facilitate internal progression and relieve compression.

In line with typical market practice, particularly in the US, and due to line-of-sight over performance measures, a gradually 
greater proportion of the LTIP award is made as RSUs (which are not subject to performance conditions but still align 
employee interests with those of shareholders) for eligible roles from Executive Committee level down.

IHG matches the number of shares purchased by employees, up to a value of USD 1,000 per year, on a 1-for-1 basis. 
We expanded the offering of our Colleague Share Plan to include those in our Corporate Reservations offices, as well 
as a small number of corporate colleagues in countries that were not previously eligible, making the plan available to 
approximately 98% of our corporate employees below the senior/mid-management level (who receive LTIP and/or 
RSU awards). The registration for 2024 was open to eligible colleagues in Q4 2023, and the take-up rate for the 2024 plan, 
including the newly eligible population is 34.8%. For a similar comparison on previous disclosures, the take-up rate 
excluding the new population is 51.2% (vs. 50.3% for the 2023 plan). Over 26,100 matching shares vested from the 
2021 Colleague Share Plan in January 2023; the 2022 plan’s matching share awards vested in January 2024 with over 
30,900 shares vesting between 2,028 employees.

schemes

All

Colleagues who are below Senior Leader level can be nominated for a cash award through our Bravo recognition 
scheme, they can be nominated for going above and beyond in their jobs while displaying exceptional IHG behaviours. 
All of the corporate workforce, including Executive Directors, are eligible to receive a Long-Term Service Award, of 
varying value, once the employee reaches certain service milestones. In 2023, 3,834 one-off cash recognition awards 
were made to corporate colleagues and 3,438 to hotel colleagues globally; 814 corporate colleagues and 995 hotel 
colleagues globally received cash long-term service awards. 

Employee engagement on pay
We have several forums available for employees to share their thoughts, including employee resource groups (ERGs), a designated 
Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement and our employee engagement survey, known as Colleague HeartBeat, which allows 
employees to express their views on key aspects of working at IHG. As the charts below show, the 2023 employee engagement scores for 
participating hotel and reservations employees and general managers on the questions relating to reward and recognition exceeded our 
survey provider’s top quartile benchmark.

Wellbeing
We have continued to promote myWellbeing – a framework to support employees across their health, lifestyle and workplace. 
The myWellbeing suite of resources, which includes an employee Wellbeing Handbook and guidelines for people managers, has been 
designed to provide a holistic wellbeing offering. Employees also have access to a global Employee Assistance Programme, which offers 
counselling, practical guidance on topics such as legal, financial and work matters, and additional health and wellbeing resources.

In the UK, we introduced a network of Mental Health First Aiders. This is part of our commitment to ensure the right support is in place to help 
everyone feel at their best and forms part of our approach to make mental health support more accessible and further unlock the stigma. 
We trained a small number of people in 2023, with the potential to roll out more widely at IHG across other markets, including our UK 
managed hotel estate. We increased our focus on financial education, providing our UK corporate colleagues with free expert information 
and guidance to stay on track to achieve both financial goals and objectives and to support them on their personal financial journeys by 
offering group webinar sessions and wellbeing articles.

We have also continued to champion initiatives such as Focused Fridays, where we limit meetings, and Recharge Days, where corporate 
colleagues can spend the day doing whatever they need to unwind. In 2023, all corporate colleagues were given three recharge days 
to spend as they please, on top of any contracted annual leave they are eligible to receive. These initiatives have helped us achieve a 
3% increase in our Wellbeing Index scores for all of our colleagues, and a 2% increase to 89% for our hotel colleagues on last year’s scores.

UK leased hotel employees
As previously reported, following the acquisition of a number of UK hotels in 2019, employing entities for the estate’s hotels were transferred 
to IHG. Employment terms, including remuneration and benefits, largely remained in place on their pre-acquisition basis. As with the model 
for leased hotels generally, IHG provides hotel management support to the owners of these UK leased hotels and makes recommendations 
on matters, including pay, based on market insight and experience. Decisions on implementing pay changes are ultimately determined by 
the hotel estate owner in the context of their own commercial position and equities across the wider portfolio. 

•  Salary increases for 2023 ranged from 5% to 8%, with higher increases applicable for frontline employees. The Real Living Wage will 

continue to be applied as a minimum for all staff in line with the Real Living Wage Foundation level and zero-hour contracts are not utilised 
in the UK leased estate.

•  Hotel colleagues receive similar benefits to corporate employees, including enrolment into a workplace pension, employee room rates, 

Employee Assistance Programme, Bravo recognition programme, retail discount vouchers, the myWellbeing programme and refer-a-friend 
bonus. Frontline colleagues can also receive incentives and performance-driven bonuses and eligible managers receive an annual 
performance bonus. In April 2023, enhanced maternity and paternity pay was launched for all hotel colleagues and we also teamed up 
with Busy Bees Nurseries to offer our managed hotel colleagues a 20% discount on childcare fees.

Championing a diverse culture where everyone can thrive
One of our 2030 commitments is to drive gender balance and a doubling of under-represented groups across our leadership, and we are 
building on the significant progress we have made over the past decade towards achieving gender balance, with 35% of our leaders (VP and 
above) being female (vs. an ambition of 39% by 2025), and a gender-balanced employee population, of which 52% is female. We are delighted 
to be recognised by Forbes as one of the world’s top companies for women, and we were rated second on the Financial Times Diversity 
Leaders in 2024. We have reduced our Gender Pay gap in the UK by 16% since 2017, our first year of reporting.

 Our latest Gender Pay report is available on IHG’s website at ihgplc.com/en/responsible-business/reporting under Reporting.

Remuneration Committee details

2023 focus areas

•  Review and approval of 2022 remuneration outcomes and 2023 incentive plan structures and targets.

•  In-year performance and relative performance tracking.

•  Wider workforce remuneration matters.

•  ESG in incentives.

•  Review, approval and implementation of the 2023 DR Policy.

•  Review, approval and implementation of the Deferred Award Plan (DAP) rules.

•  Shareholder engagement prior to, and following, the AGM vote.

•  CEO remuneration package.

Key objectives and summary of responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee agrees, on behalf of the Board, all 
aspects of remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Executive 
Committee and the Chair of the Board, and also agrees the strategy, 
direction and policy for the remuneration of the senior executives 
who have a significant influence over the Group’s ability to meet 
its strategic objectives. Additionally, the Committee reviews wider 
workforce pay policies and practice to ensure alignment with 
strategy, values and behaviours and takes this into account when 
setting Executive Director remuneration. The Committee’s role and 
responsibilities are set out in its Terms of Reference (ToR), which are 
reviewed annually and approved by the Board.

  The ToR are available on IHG’s website at ihgplc.com/investors 
under Corporate governance.

Membership and attendance at meetings
Details of the Committee membership and meeting attendance 
are set out on pages 96 and 118.

During 2023, the Committee was supported internally by the 
Company Chair, the Group’s CEO and CFO, and the heads of 
Human Resources and Reward as necessary. All attend by invitation 
to provide further background information and context to assist the 
Committee in its duties. They are not present for any discussions 
that relate directly to their own remuneration or where their 
attendance would not be appropriate.

Reporting to the Board
The Committee Chair updates the Board on all key issues raised at 
Committee meetings. Papers and minutes for each meeting are also 
circulated to all Board members for review and comment.

Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment  
and notice periods
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment, which are 
available upon request from the Company Secretary’s office.

Deanna Oppenheimer, Non-Executive Chair, is subject to 12 months’ 
notice and is in compliance with Provision 19 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. No other Non-Executive Directors are subject to 
notice periods; all Non-Executive Directors are subject to an annual 
re-election by shareholders at the AGM.

Effectiveness of the Committee
The effectiveness of the Committee is monitored and assessed 
regularly by the Chair of the Committee and the Chair of the Board.

Remuneration advisers
IHG appointed Deloitte LLP to act as independent adviser to the 
Committee in 2019 following a competitive tender process undertaken 
by the Committee. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and, as such, operates under the code of conduct 
in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.

Fees of £159,400 were paid to Deloitte in respect of advice provided 
to the Committee in 2023, which included significant input into the 
review and implementation of the DR Policy during the year. This was 
in the form of an agreed fee for support in the preparation of papers 
and attendance at meetings, with work on additional items charged 
at hourly rates. The terms of engagement for Deloitte are available 
from the Company Secretary’s office upon request. Separately, 
other parts of Deloitte LLP also advised the Company in relation to 
corporation tax, mobility and consulting services. The Committee 
is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent.

Approach to target setting
Targets are set by the Committee and senior management, taking 
into account IHG’s growth ambitions and long-range business plan, 
market expectations and the circumstances and relative performance 
at the time, to set stretching achievement targets for senior executives 
that will reflect successful outcomes for the business based on its 
strategic and financial objectives for the period.

Absolute targets may be set relative to budget and/or by reference 
to prior results, generally containing a performance range with 
additional stretch to incentivise outperformance and minimum 
performance levels for payout. Relative targets are set against an 
appropriate comparator group of companies for the relevant measure, 
for example, relative NSSG in the LTIP was set against our six largest 
competitors with over 500k rooms to reflect our strategy of 
accelerating the growth of our brands in high-value markets.

Performance will be reviewed throughout the period in which it 
is applicable for, and, if any corrections are required, this will be 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year in 
which the correction has been agreed. Details on a correction for 
the 2023/25 LTIP calculation can be found on page 132.

Shareholder engagement
The Chair of the Committee engaged extensively with shareholders 
during 2023 in respect of the DR Policy, both in advance of the AGM 
and following the vote of less than 80% support at the AGM, in order 
to understand the range of views held by shareholders and to take 
these into account when setting and implementing the policy, as 
well as outline the rationale for the changes made. 

At the October 2023 meetings, in addition to follow-up comments 
on the 2023 DRR and DR Policy, Angie Risley was introduced to 
shareholders as the Committee Chair designate, effective 1 January 
2024, and new CEO pay arrangements were discussed for 
Elie Maalouf, following his appointment to the role. In January 2024, 
shortly after Angie commenced her role as Committee Chair, 
she held meetings with shareholders for more comprehensive 
two-way introductions and discussions about current IHG-specific 
remuneration challenges and shareholder views and expectations. 
Further information on shareholder engagement is contained in the 
Chair’s Statement on pages 116 to 118.

Board changes
During the year, Byron Grote and Graham Allan replaced Ian Dyson 
and Jill McDonald as Chair of the Audit Committee and Chair of the 
Responsible Business Committee with effect from 1 March 2023 
after Ian and Jill retired from the Board. Jo Harlow also stepped 
down from the Board and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee

Director prior to assuming the Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
role effective 1 January 2024 and Sir Ron Kalifa was appointed to the 
Board from 1 January 2024. The remuneration arrangements in 
respect of all changes were in line with the approved DR Policy.

As announced by the Company on 5 May 2023 and the s430(2B) 
of the Companies Act 2006 declaration released on 28 June 2023, 
Keith Barr stepped down from the role of Chief Executive Officer, 
and from the Board, on 30 June 2023. Elie Maalouf succeeded 
Keith Barr as Group CEO with effect from 1 July 2023, Elie was already 
a member of IHG’s Board in leading IHG’s Americas business as 
regional CEO. 

Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson stepped down from the role of Chief 
Financial Officer & Group Head of Strategy, and from the Board, 
leaving IHG on 19 March 2023. Michael Glover succeeded Paul 
as Chief Financial Officer with effect from 20 March 2023. 

Details of the arrangements for all Executive Directors are as follows:

AUDITED

Remuneration component

How this was implemented in 2023

Elie Maalouf

Salary, pension and benefits

Elie’s base salary for the role of CEO from 1 July 2023 is £990,000 and he will not be eligible for a salary increase 
until April 2025. Elie’s pension cash allowance is 12% of salary, which is within the maximum opportunity of the 2023 
DR Policy and aligns to the wider IHG UK pension plan participants. Elie’s benefits are in line with the DR Policy. 

Annual Performance Plan (APP)

Elie’s APP levels are in line with the maximum opportunity of the DR Policy. His 2023 APP award will be pro-rated 
using the respective salaries for the respective periods before and after his appointment as Group CEO. 

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Elie’s LTIP award levels align with the maximum opportunity shown in the DR Policy.

Other

Elie relocated from the CEO, Americas role based out of the Atlanta office to the Group CEO role, which is primarily 
based out of the UK office. On appointment, and in line with how we treat other international moves, Elie received 
a one-off net cash payment of £50,000 towards costs associated with setting up a UK base. The grossed up value 
of this payment has been disclosed in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 128.

To facilitate Elie to carry out his UK-based role while maintaining his US home and IHG’s significant business, 
government and industry interests in the US, he also receives a net amount of £10,000 per month towards UK 
housing costs. The actual net cost per month on housing for 2023 was, on average, lower than this but will be 
adjusted to allow for rental market dynamics over the longer term.

Michael Glover

Salary, pension and benefits

Michael’s base salary from 20 March 2023 is £620,000 and he was not eligible for a merit increase in April 2023. 
His pension and other benefits are in line with the DR Policy.

Annual Performance Plan (APP) Michael’s APP levels are in line with the DR Policy. His 2023 APP award will be pro-rated using the respective salaries 

and targets for the respective periods before and after his appointment as Group CFO.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Michael’s LTIP award levels are in line with the DR Policy. He was granted an award at Executive Director level for the 

full 2023/25 cycle, however, did not receive an uplift into in-flight cycles at the increased Executive Director levels.

Other

Keith Barr

Salary, pension and benefits

Annual Performance Plan (APP)

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Michael relocated from his CFO, Americas, role based out of the Atlanta office to the Group CFO role in the UK head 
office. In line with how we treat other international moves, a series of one-off payments to cover relocation and 
associated costs apply for the first three years: £150,000 payments both on appointment and on the first anniversary 
of appointment and £100,000 on the second anniversary of appointment.

Keith received his base salary, pension cash allowance and benefits to 30 June 2023, details of which are included 
in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 128. After he stepped down from the Board, he remained an 
employee of the Company on his existing terms of employment until 31 December 2023 to ensure an orderly handover. 
As an employee, he continued to be paid a salary and receive his existing benefits through to that date, apart from 
healthcare provision, which will continue for up to three months after this date. 

Keith is eligible to receive an APP award in respect of the full 2023 financial year, which is assessed and paid in the 
usual way and in accordance with the terms of the plan. Half of any APP earned will be delivered in cash following 
the end of the performance year, with the other half deferred into shares for three years. The pro-rated element for 
the 2023 period in which he served as Group CEO can be found in the single total figure table. The Remuneration 
Committee exercised its discretion to determine that he would be treated as a ‘good leaver’. Accordingly, his 
unvested deferred APP shares will not be forfeited on departure and will vest in full on their original vesting dates.

Keith’s share awards, granted in 2021 and 2022, under the LTIP are preserved in accordance with the ‘good leaver’ 
provisions, subject to the achievement of the relevant performance conditions, adjusted for pro-ration until the date he 
ceased employment with the Company, and vesting on their original vesting dates. In accordance with the DR Policy, 
they will be subject to a two-year post-vest holding period. The LTIP 2021/23 cycle award is disclosed in the 2023 single 
total figure of remuneration table on page 128. He has not received an LTIP award in respect of the 2023/25 cycle.

Minimum Shareholding Policy

The post-employment shareholding policy approved at the time of Keith’s termination has been applied. He is 
required to hold shares equivalent to his minimum shareholding requirement of 500% of salary for six months 
post-cessation and 50% of the minimum shareholding requirement for a further six months. 

Other

IHG also agreed to settle fees of £13,850 plus VAT for legal advice to Keith on his leaving arrangements.

Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson

Salary, pension and benefits

Annual Performance Plan (APP)

Paul’s salary, pension and benefits were paid up until 19 March 2023, details of which are included in the single total 
figure of remuneration table on page 128. In line with our previous commitment, his pension had been reduced to 
the rate of all other IHG UK pension plan participants, which is 12% of salary, from 1 January 2023. No further payments 
in respect of these elements were paid beyond 19 March 2023, given he was taking up new employment.

Paul remained eligible to receive an APP award in respect of the full 2022 performance year. In line with our 
termination policy, the cash element was paid in the usual way, but the deferred share awards portion was forfeited. 
He was not eligible to receive an APP award in respect of 2023. All outstanding APP shares that had not vested on 
19 March 2023 were forfeited.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Paul’s LTIP 2020/22 award was assessed in the same way as for the other Executive Directors and it vested on 
22 February 2023, and is subject to a two-year holding period. He was not eligible to receive an LTIP award in respect 
of 2023. All outstanding LTIP awards that had not vested on 19 March 2023 were forfeited.

Minimum Shareholding Policy

The post-employment shareholding policy approved at the time of Paul’s termination has been applied. He is 
required to hold shares equivalent to his minimum shareholding requirement of 300% of salary as at the date of 
leaving for six months post-cessation and 50% of the minimum shareholding requirements for a further six months. 
He remained compliant with this policy throughout 2023.

Other

No other payments have been made in connection with his leaving.

Wider workforce remuneration and employee engagement
As outlined on pages 123 to 124, IHG operates an aligned approach 
to remuneration throughout the organisation. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed aspects of the Company’s wider workforce 
remuneration approach as part of its regular meeting agenda. 

The Company engaged with the workforce through its employee 
engagement survey, which covers a number of areas, including pay 
and benefits competitiveness, wellness and inclusion. Our overall 
employee engagement increased to 87% (+1% on 2022), placing IHG 
as a Global Best Employer by Kincentric. As noted on page 124, 
perceptions of reward and recognition gained strong results across 
our hotel, reservations and general manager populations. 

During 2023, the Chair of the Committee joined IHG’s designated 
Non-Executive Director responsible for workforce engagement in a 
Voice of the Employee session. These sessions are held throughout 
the year to engage directly with members of IHG’s corporate and 
hotel workforce, with the aim of collating and sharing such feedback 
with the Board for consideration in its decision-making. No concerns 
were raised regarding Executive Director remuneration or how it 
aligns with the wider IHG remuneration principles. Further details 
about the 2023 Voice of the Employee engagement sessions can 
be found on page 113. Further sessions are planned for 2024 for 
Angie to attend as the new Chair of the Committee.

Deferred Award Plan rules
In 2023, the new DAP rules were approved by shareholders at the 
May AGM. The DAP replaced both the previous APP and LTIP rules as 
a simplified, combined set of plan rules to govern the share awards 
made under the Company’s discretionary incentive arrangements. 

The rules for both the APP and LTIP were due to expire in 2024, and 
the Committee considered it appropriate to renew them a year early 
to coincide with the adoption of the new DR Policy. Following approval 
at the 2023 AGM, LTIP share awards were granted under the DAP 
with effect from the 2023/25 cycle, and future APP share awards 
will be granted under the DAP with effect from the 2024 plan year. 
All awards granted under previous cycles will remain subject to the 
APP and LTIP rules that were previously in place.

Service contracts and notice periods for Executive Directors 
The Committee’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have service 
contracts with a notice period of 12 months from the Company and 
a notice period of 6 months for the employee, unless, on an 
exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, 
a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used. This is 
in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 

All Executive Directors’ appointments and subsequent 
re-appointments to the Board are subject to election and annual 
re-election by shareholders at the AGM.

a  LTIP figures for 2022 relate to the 2020/22 LTIP cycle and have been restated using actual share price on date of vesting. Figures for 2023 relate to the value of shares for the 

2021/23 cycle.

b  Elie Maalouf’s 2023 figure combines his CEO, Americas role for the period 1 January to 30 June, and his Group CEO role for the period 1 July to 31 December. Elie was paid in USD for 
his CEO, Americas role and the sterling equivalent is calculated using an exchange rate of $1 = £0.80 in 2023 and $1 = £0.81 in 2022 (page 173). In line with 2023, the 2022 benefits 
figure has been restated to reduce the residual value of UK tax paid in respect of UK duties while a US Director from £7k to nil due to subsequent foreign tax credit offsetting.
c  Michael Glover’s 2023 fixed pay elements relate to the period 20 March to 31 December 2023. His APP has been pro-rated for the period in which he was Executive Director 
and his LTIP award, inclusive of Restricted Stock Units, is for the full 2021/23 LTIP cycle. His LTIP and RSU 2021/23 awards were granted in May 2021 prior to becoming an 
Executive Director, the same performance conditions applied to the LTIP award as they did for the Executive Directors; the RSU awards were not subject to any performance 
conditions. No 2022 data has been provided because he was not in an Executive Director role at the time.

d  Keith Barr stepped down from the CEO role on 30 June 2023 so 2023 figures related to the period 1 January to 30 June 2023, with the exception of his LTIP 2021/23 which the 

full cycle value has been disclosed. Further details on the treatment of his remuneration on leaving IHG can be found on page 126.

e  Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson left the Company on 19 March 2023 and his fixed pay elements were paid up to this date. He was not eligible to receive an APP award for 2023 and his 

LTIP 2021/23 award was forfeited upon leaving IHG. Further details on the treatment of his remuneration on leaving IHG can be found on page 127.

f  Details of the ‘Other’ payments for Elie Maalouf and Michael Glover can be found in the notes to the single total figure table section below.

Notes to the single total figure table

Fixed pay

   Salary: salary paid for the year. Salary increases in 2023 were 
lower than the budget for the wider UK and US corporate 
workforce. See pages 126 to 127 for information on Executive 
Director changes during 2023.

   Benefits: for Executive Directors, this includes, but is not 
limited to, taxable benefits such as company car or allowance 
and healthcare.

As disclosed on page 126, to facilitate Elie Maalouf to carry 
out his UK-based role whilst maintaining his US home and IHG’s 
significant business, government and industry interests in the US, 
he also receives a net amount of £10,000 per month towards UK 
housing costs. The 2023 benefits figure for Elie also includes 
travel and accommodation costs in relation to his relocation.

   Pension benefit: for current Executive Directors, in line with 
the DR Policy, includes the value of IHG contributions and any 
cash allowances paid in lieu of pension contributions.

Elie Maalouf and Michael Glover both relocated to the UK for their 
Group CEO and Group CFO roles; they did not participate in the 
IHG UK pension plan in 2023 and instead received cash allowances 
of 12% of salary. Keith Barr and Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson also did 
not participate in any IHG pension plan in 2023 for their respective 
periods of employment and instead received cash allowances of 
12% of base salary. This is in line with the maximum level available 
to all other participants in the UK pension plan. 

Life assurance cover for all Executive Directors was provided 
at four times base salary.

Elie Maalouf participated in the US 401(k) Plan and the US Deferred 
Compensation Plan (DCP) for the period 1 January to 30 June 2023 
whilst in his role as CEO, Americas. The US 401(k) Plan is a 
tax-qualified plan providing benefits on a defined contribution 
basis, with the member and company both contributing. 

Contributions made by, and in respect of, Elie Maalouf in these 
plans for the year ended 31 December 2023 were:

a  Sterling values have been calculated using an exchange rate of $1 = £0.80.

As outlined in last year’s report, Elie’s retirement benefits were 
in line with other senior US employees and comprised of a 6% 
of salary matched contribution (subject to IRS limits in respect of 
401(k) contributions) and a 16% of salary supplemental employer 
DCP contribution.

Other
Elie Maalouf received a net payment of £50,000 in July 2023 to 
cover the transitional and transactional costs of setting up a UK 
base. The value of this one-off payment has been grossed up for 
disclosure in the single total figure of remuneration table above.

Michael Glover received a gross payment of £150,000 to cover 
relocation and associated costs.

Operation
Disclosed award levels are determined based on salary as at 
31 December 2023, other than for Elie Maalouf whose award was 
pro-rated based on his respective salaries and periods as CEO, 
Americas and Group CEO, and on a straight-line basis between 
threshold and target, and target and maximum, and are based 
on achievement vs target under each measure:

to be an award in relation to that measure; subject to Committee 
discretion, no award is made for achievement below threshold;

•  target is the target level of achievement and results in a target 

award for that measure; and

•  maximum is the level of achievement at which a maximum 

award for that measure is received (capped at 200% of salary).

The Committee formally reviews performance against IHG’s 
Global Metrics as part of the APP structure in considering 
whether to apply discretion to adjust outcomes on the strategic 
measures. Any application of discretion to the APP outcome, 
would be disclosed in the relevant year’s Directors’ Remuneration 
Report.

For Executive Directors, 50% of the 2023 APP award will be 
made in the form of shares, deferred for three years, subject 
to continued employment.

APP outcome for 2023
The performance measures for the 2023 APP were determined 
in accordance with the DR Policy and were:

•  operating profit from reportable segments (70%);

•  room signings (15%); and

•  room openings (15%).

Target award was 115% of salary and maximum was up to 200% 
of target for each measure, subject to an overall cap on the award 
of 200% of salary. The following chart and table shows threshold, 
target and maximum opportunity, as well as weighting and actual

Additionally, in determining operating profit from reportable 
segments for APP purposes, budgeted exchange rates for the 
year are used to ensure like-for-like comparison with the APP 
target set at the start of the year.

Operation
Awards are made annually and eligible executives will receive 
shares at the end of the cycle, subject to achievement of the 
three-year performance conditions. These conditions and 
weightings are described on page 130.

TSR measures the return to shareholders by investing in IHG 
relative to a comparator group containing the following major 
globally branded competitors: Accor S.A., Choice Hotels 
International Inc., Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., Hyatt Hotels 
Corporation, Marriott International Inc., Melia Hotels International 
S.A., NH Hotels Group, and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc., 
as per data provided by our corporate bankers sourced from 
Refinitiv Datastream. Maximum payout is for upper quartile 
relative performance, and threshold is median of the 
comparator group. 

Any use of discretion, including the factors influencing the decision, 
will be clearly communicated in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year in which the decision is made.

The share price in respect of the 2020/22 LTIP cycle has been 
restated using the volume weighted average price of 5,467p 
for all Executive Directors on the date of actual vesting on 
22 February 2023. The corresponding values shown in the 2022 
report (prior to the actual vesting) were an estimate calculated 
using an average share price over the final quarter of 2022 
of 4,687p.

Adjustments to absolute cash flow outcome
Over the performance period of the 2021/23 LTIP award, there have been events 
that have impacted IHG’s cash flow that were unquantified or unforeseen when 
the original targets were set. In line with the adjustments reported in previous 
Directors’ Remuneration Reports, the table opposite shows the reconciliation 
between reported cash flow and the outcome for the 2021/23 LTIP. This includes 
adjustments agreed by the Committee to exclude the impact of the exit from 
Russia, as described on page 128 of the 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
and consider adjustment for the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza quality review to 
the extent the final programme differed from what was reflected in the LTIP target. 
These adjustments had no effect on the vesting outcome.

Adjustment to other measures
As disclosed in the 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report, IHG announced the decision to cease all operations in Russia. Net system 
size growth performance for IHG and all companies in the peer set for this relative measure has been adjusted to remove the Russia 
system size from all companies for all years. The formulaic NSSG LTIP outcome also includes an adjustment to exclude room removals 
incremental to our normal level due to the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza estate review in 2021.

These events were not budgeted for at the time of setting the 2021/23 targets, and the Committee, in its judgement, considered it was 
appropriate to adjust for them on the basis of its view that LTIP participants should not have been disincentivised from making these 
decisions in the long-term interest of shareholders. 

The Committee considered performance against the ROCE underpin. The underpin level of 20% was met, with the final ROCE average 
of the three years being 23.7%, therefore the Committee did not need to consider adjusting the NSSG vesting level in respect of this.

a  Following a disclosure of this measure in the 2023 DR Policy, a calculation error was identified in the configuration of one aspect of the target for this metric. The Committee 

has agreed to the correction of this mathematical error, which means the threshold and maximum targets for this metric are as disclosed above. It is important to note that this 
correction, resulting from a technical modelling error in incentive plan target configuration, does not alter the intended level of stretch inherent in performance required to 
meet targets as anticipated at the outset, nor does it impact the Company’s wider carbon reduction goals. 

Consideration of discretion
Following Keith Barr’s 30 years with IHG, culminating in serving the last 
six as Group CEO and ensuring a smooth transition to Elie Maalouf 
after stepping down from the Board, the Committee exercised its 
discretion to treat Keith as a ‘good leaver’ for the purpose of his 
unvested share awards. In line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Committee has adopted a robust, formal framework that 
it will use to determine whether to exercise discretion. Some of the 
key factors the Committee considers are shown below. 

Relative importance of spend on pay
The chart below sets out the actual expenditure of the Group 
in 2023 and 2022, showing the differences between those years.

AUDITED

Executive Directors’ shareholdings and share interests
The Committee believes that share ownership by Executive 
Directors and senior executives strengthens the link between 
the individuals’ personal interests and those of shareholders.

   Guideline Executive Director shareholding requirement

Executive Directors are required to hold shares equal to 500% of 
salary for the Chief Executive Officer and any US-based Executive 
Directors, and 300% for other Executive Directors. Executive 
Directors are expected to hold all net shares earned until the 
previous guideline shareholding requirement is achieved (300% 
for the CEO and any US-based Executive Directors, and 200% 
for other Executive Directors) and at least 50% of all subsequent 
net shares earned until the current guideline shareholding is met. 
The number of shares held outright includes all Directors’ 
beneficial interests and those held by their spouses and other 
connected persons. It also includes the net value of unvested 
shares that are not subject to any further performance conditions.

Percentages are calculated using the 29 December 2023 share 
price of 7,090p.

We increased our post-employment shareholding requirement 
with effect from the approval of our current DR Policy, approved 
at the 2023 AGM, so that the full guideline minimum shareholding 
requirement continues for two years post-cessation of employment. 

As part of this requirement, since 2019, shares have been 
granted and all unvested awards held in a nominee account with 
Executive Directors required to electronically sign an agreement

AUDITED

Payments to past Directors 
Sir Ian Prosser
Sir Ian Prosser, who retired as Director on 31 December 2003, 
had an ongoing healthcare benefit of £1,710 during the year.

Payments for loss of office
Keith Barr
Keith Barr stepped down from the Board of IHG on 30 June 2023. 
A statement to this effect was prepared pursuant to Section 
430(2B) of the CA 2006 and can be found on the IHG PLC 
website. He remained an employee of the Company until 
31 December 2023 and therefore continued to receive salary and 
benefits and remain eligible for a 2023 APP award. The Committee 

exercised its discretion to treat Keith as a ‘good leaver’ for the 
purpose of his unvested share awards, pro-rated to his date of 
leaving for the LTIP and they will continue to vest according to 
the normal vesting schedule for the award. He did not receive a 
grant in the 2023/25 LTIP cycle. IHG also agreed to settle fees of 
£13,850 plus VAT in connection with legal advice to Keith on these 
arrangements. Full details of his arrangements on leaving and the 
use of discretion are shown on pages 126 and 132.

Pension entitlements
No Executive Director is entitled to any Defined Benefit pension 
or related benefit from IHG.

CEO pay ratio 
As we have noted in previous DRRs, pay ratios will differ significantly 
between companies, even within the same industry, depending 
on demographics and business models. The Group’s UK employee 
demographic, which primarily consisted of largely professional, 
management and senior corporate roles, changed in 2019 with the 
addition of a number of hotel employing entities, comprising the 
UK leased estate, which includes a large proportion of part-time 
and flexible-working support and service roles. As per our past 
disclosures, we show the ratio both including and excluding the 
UK hotel employing entities.

The 2018-2022 figures have been restated to reflect the value of the CEO’s LTIP awards on 
the date of actual vesting rather than the estimated vesting levels used in the respective 
years’ DRRs.

What drives the difference in pay between our CEO 
and other employees?
Pay ratios reflect how remuneration arrangements differ as 
responsibility increases for more senior roles within the organisation, 
for example:

•  this is the first year the increased LTIP quantum from the 2020 

DR Policy vests for the CEO, the increase was deferred by a year 
so was not granted at the higher level until 2021. Although there 
was a strong APP outcome for both the CEO and wider corporate 
population, a greater proportion of performance-related variable 
pay and share-based incentives apply for the more senior executives, 
including Executive Directors, who will have a greater degree of 
influence over performance outcomes;

•  role-specific specialist plans apply in certain areas such as 

corporate reservations, sales, hotel development and General 
Managers of IHG managed, owned, leased and managed lease 
hotels. The target and maximum amounts that can be earned 
under these plans are typically a higher percentage of base salary 
for more senior employees, which in turn affect the pay ratio; and

•  incentive plans for other corporate employees are typically based 

on a combination of individual performance and the Group’s 
operating profit from reportable segments.

The increase in ratio since 2020, reflects the strong performance 
of the business and the resulting increases in variable pay outcomes. 
The comparative CEO figure used for calculating this year’s ratio 
included some one-off costs associated with Elie Maalouf’s relocation. 

The population demographics have also had a larger impact than 
in previous years as the full population in 2023 includes a greater 
number of hotel employees than it did in 2022. Overall, on this basis, 
the Company believes the median pay ratio for the relevant financial 
year is consistent with the pay, reward and progression for the 
Company’s UK employees taken as a whole.

Calculation methodology and supporting information
Option C has been selected for the identification of the percentile 
employees. IHG prefer to use this method as we are able to produce 
the most accurate total remuneration figure for all UK employees 
on a basis comparable with the statutory reporting for Executive 
Directors using the most recently available data at the time of 
producing the Annual Report. Specifically, this involves:

•  compiling all monthly payroll data for all UK employees from 

1 January to 31 December 2023 detailing complete variable and 
fixed remuneration, including pension and taxable benefits such 
as company car or allowance and healthcare; and

•  valuing APP for the corporate workforce based on actual 2023 
company performance metrics but only target for the personal 
performance metric, as actual outcomes for this element of the 
award are not known at the time of writing this report, so that it 
reflects as much of the same input as for the CEO data as possible 
at the time of calculation. In practice, personal performance 
outcomes are subject to manager discretion and can be flexed 
between 0-200% of target.

As noted on page 126, we had a change of CEO during 2023, so we 
have used pro-rated salary, benefits, pension and bonus amounts 
for Keith Barr and Elie Maalouf for the respective periods in which 
they were CEO for calculating the pay ratio this year. We have used 
the full value of Keith Barr’s LTIP 2021/23 award, however, as this 
award was granted at the full level available to the CEO as per the 
DR Policy at the time, and we believe it is the most accurate figure 
for this disclosure. 

Option C requires three UK employees to be identified as the 
equivalent of the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile. Having identified 
these employees, the 2023 remuneration is calculated on the same 
basis as the CEO single total figure of remuneration.

The pay arrangements for the six employees, three from the full 
population and three from the population excluding hotel employing 
entities, were reviewed alongside those for the employees ranked 
immediately above and below them to confirm that they were 
representative of pay levels at these quartiles. The 2023 salary and 
total pay for the individuals identified at the lower, median and 
upper quartiles are set out below:

a  The total salary figure used for the 25th percentile for the full population includes  
periods of unpaid absence and the base pay for the year excluding this would have 
been £23,463.23.

In the 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report, we confirmed that 
the Real Living Wage would be applied as a minimum for all staff 
from April 2023 and on reviewing the 25th percentile for this year’s 
ratio, we can see that the annual salary for the 25th percentile (full 
population) following April 2023 merit increases is £24,128. This is 
above the annualised Real Living Wage salary for 2022/23 of £22,672 
(£11.60ph vs £10.90ph).

Fees: Fees are paid in line with the DR Policy. Jill McDonald and Ian Dyson stepped down from the Board on 28 February 2023, so all 
fees and taxable benefits for these Directors ceased on this date. Angie Risley joined the Board on 1 September 2023, so all fees and 
taxable benefits for this Director began on their appointment date.

Benefits: For Non-Executive Directors, benefits include taxable travel and accommodation expenses to attend Board meetings away 
from the designated home location. Under UK income tax legislation, the non-UK based Non-Executive Directors are not subject to tax 
on some travel expenses; this is reflected in the taxable benefits for Deanna Oppenheimer, Duriya Farooqui and Sharon Rothstein.

Other: Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for any incentive awards or for any pension contribution/benefit.

Annual percentage change in remuneration of Directors compared to employees
The table below shows the percentage change in all Directors’ remuneration compared to that of an average employee between the 
financial years ended 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2023.

The 2023 remuneration figures for the Directors are taken from the data used to compile the single total figure of remuneration tables 
shown on pages 128 and 136, excluding any rounding up or down. No employees are directly employed by the Group’s Parent Company, 
so the average employee data for this year’s report is based on the same UK corporate employee population as that on which the CEO pay 
ratio is calculated. 

Elie Maalouf became Group CEO on 1 July 2023 which involved a relocation to the UK. Elie’s salary in the previous year-on-year changes was 
calculated in USD, with the equivalent single total figure table disclosures reported in GBP. From 1 July 2023, Elie’s salary has been in GBP so, 
to reduce any impact of the currency conversion, we are now calculating his percentage change in GBP. This is the currency in which his 
salary, bonus and a large sum of his benefits will be paid going forward, and therefore will provide a more meaningful indication of his 
year-on-year remuneration changes and align further with the intentions of this disclosure.

All corporate employees share the same corporate performance metrics with the Executive Directors; however, the weightings of these 
metrics differ for corporate employees below Executive Committee level and measures include an individual performance portion, the 
results of which are not available at the time of reporting. For average employee data, we assume that target performance is achieved. 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for a bonus.

Taxable benefits for Non-Executive Directors largely comprise of travel expenses whereas, Executive Director and average employee 
taxable benefits typically comprise elements of their reward package, such as company car or allowance and healthcare benefits.

Notes to the annual percentage change in remuneration of Directors compared to employees table
•  No data has been reported for Byron Grote and Deanna Oppenheimer as they both joined the Board during 2022 and therefore only 
part-year data is available, which does not enable a comparison with 2023. Similarly, Michael Glover and Angie Risley both joined the 
Board during 2023, so there will be no full-year data comparisons for them in 2023 and 2024. 

•  Graham Allan was appointed as Chair of the Responsible Business Committee in addition to his role as Senior Non-Executive Director 

from 1 March 2023, so his salary percentage change increase incorporates the base fee increase and the addition of his role supplements.

•  As explained above, Elie Maalouf took on the role of Group CEO on 1 July 2023, therefore his salary percentage change increase 

incorporates his new remuneration package for part of 2023. Elie’s 2023 taxable benefits figure also includes additional relocation costs, 
including a one-off relocation payment and an ongoing housing allowance which were not applicable in 2022. The 2022 vs 2021 
percentage change for Elie has been updated due to the 2022 benefits figure being restated as noted on page 128.

•  In 2023, more in-person Board Meetings were held than in 2022. Graham Allan incurred only £2,016.61 in expenses in 2022 but incurred 
£4,200.55 in 2023, hence the percentage change increase for 2023 vs 2022 is 108%. Similarly, Daniela Barone Soares, Arthur de Haast 
and Duriya Farooqui incurred an additional £734.70, £1,310.10 and £1,370.07 on 2022 figures respectively. As expected, the extreme 
fluctuations shown in percentage change in last year’s disclosure have already begun to reduce and we expect these to even out more 
going forward as Board meetings return to a more regular structure.

•  The bonus outcome for the average employee has fallen by a lower percentage than that of Executive Directors due to the difference 
in weightings for measures and additional budget being made available for the individual performance element for employees below 
Executive Committee level. 

•  Any significant percentage changes in the previous year-on-year changes (2022 vs 2021, 2021 vs 2020 and 2020 vs 2019) are explained 

in the relevant year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Elie Maalouf is not eligible for a merit increase in 2024 following his appointment as Group CEO on 1 July 2023. Further details regarding 
his appointment can be found on page 126. The increase for the CFO is shown above and is in line with the budget for the wider corporate 
workforce. For Executive Director merit increases, we use a range of considerations including wider workforce merit increases, market data 
and external benchmarking. In addition to FTSE 100 data and other hotel comparators, we use the following US comparator group for CEO 
salary and overall pay benchmarking: Choice Hotels International Inc.; Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.; Hyatt Hotels Corporation; Marriott 
International Inc.; and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc..

Measures for 2024 APP
The 2024 APP structure is in line with the approved DR Policy and will be based on a 70% weighting for a measure of operating profit from 
reportable segments and a 30% weighting for other key strategic measures that are reviewed annually and set in line with business priorities. 
The target award has been reduced from 115% to 100% of salary, and subject to meeting minimum shareholding requirements, up to 70% 
of the award may be paid in cash and at least 30% in deferred shares.

Operating profit from reportable segments is a focal measure of business performance for our shareholders and is a function of other 
critical measures, such as RevPAR, profit margin and fee revenues. The Committee has determined that for 2024, it remains important 
to the Company’s strategic objectives to focus on new room openings and new room signings in the APP. New room openings are critical 
to driving both short- and long-term profitable growth and are a recognised key performance measure across the industry, whilst new room 
signings provide the best gauge of future growth as they create the path for openings in future years, which will, in turn, drive profit and 
revenue growth. The two strategic measures will be evenly weighted, with each worth 15% of the overall APP. The targets are commercially 
sensitive and will be disclosed in the 2024 Annual Report.

Measures and targets for 2024/26 LTIP cycle
For the 2024/26 cycle, we will retain a net system size growth (NSSG) measure reflecting our strategy of accelerating the growth of our 
brands in high-value markets, this will have a relative performance target against our six largest competitors and the weighting for this 
measure will remain at 20%. The cash flow measure to deliver consistent and sustained growth remains in place with a weighting of 20%. 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) continues to make up another 20% of the 2024/26 cycle measures; the TSR comparator group has been 
updated for the 2024/26 cycle. The existing comparator group (up to the 2023/25 LTIP cycle) can be found on page 129 of this report and 
the new TSR comparator group (with effect from the 2024/26 LTIP cycle) can be found within the table below. Alongside the new companies 
that have been added to the group, the existing member NH Hotels has been replaced with its majority shareholder, Minor International.

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was introduced as a balancing measure to TSR with effect from the 2023/25 LTIP cycle, and this will remain 
in place with a 20% weighting as a balance to the more volatile and less controllable TSR measure. Adjusted EPS targets incorporate assumed 
share buybacks as part of our ongoing shareholder return programme, so the Committee would not expect to adjust performance outcomes 
at the end of the performance period for buybacks made during the cycle. Following the introduction of an ESG measure in our 2023/25 
LTIP cycle, we have continued to include ESG in the 2024/26 cycle with a weighting of 20% made up of four equally weighted measures 
based on IHG’s People and Planet goals. Further information, including on the underlying metrics for ESG, can be found on page 140.

The measures for the 2024/26 cycle are as follows:

ESG measures
Our ESG measures for the 2024/26 LTIP cycle are again aligned to the Planet and People aspects of our Journey to Tomorrow responsible 
business plan. The new measures build on the 2023/25 LTIP cycle, with the Planet measures focusing on the ongoing rollout of new Energy 
Conservation Measures (ECMs) in the existing hotel estate as part of our brand standards and the development of hotels that operate at very 
low/zero carbon, a programme for which is expected to launch in 2024. Stretching targets have been set for these metrics, with full payout 
requiring 100% adoption of five ECMs, including in franchise hotels (Scope 3) and 15 new hotels that operate at low/zero carbon open or 
under construction. These are important areas within management control which support the delivery of our long-term carbon and energy 
goals.

The 2024/26 People measures build on and complement our representation measures in the 2023/25 cycle. They are focused on strengthening 
our inclusive culture and talent-driven approach to growth, as part of our commitment to our people. A challenging maximum target has 
been set to level up the average of ‘inclusion index’ scores, an aspect of our employee engagement survey (carried out by an external party), 
for ethnically diverse US and UK corporate and hotel colleagues to be at least in line with those of the respective full employee populations. 
Threshold for this measure has been set after careful consideration of the range of current differences in scores across these respective 
populations. The second People measure for the 2024/26 cycle supports our hotel growth agenda through existing talent intervention 
programmes targeted at developing the next generation of hotel managers. This includes the RISE programme, which aims to increase the 
number of female colleagues in hotel leadership roles across our managed and leased estates. The threshold for this measure is set in line 
with the average post-programme promotion rate for the three years to the end of 2023. The maximum target requires achievement of 
a very stretching 50% promotion rate from the 2022, 2023 and 2024 cohorts of the Journey to GM, Career Insights and RISE programmes 
by the end of the cycle in 2026.

Total Shareholder Return (TSR) comparator group
Our existing TSR comparator group was agreed in 2016 and originally included two additional companies that have since been removed 
due to a merger and delisting. The exit of these from public capital markets, and thus from the comparator group, resulted in a relatively 
small remaining comparator group. As a result, the Committee has made the decision to expand the comparator group from 8 to 15 global 
hotel companies. We believe that this mitigates the potential for the existing comparator group to become smaller due to industry 
consolidation or other factors.

The Committee applied a robust set of filters to select the additions to the comparator group and believe that the broadening of the comparator 
group reflects that IHG has an international footprint; competes with a wide range of hotel peers across the world; and that we have a diverse 
investor base, with some shareholders more focused on European and globally listed businesses, in addition to those with a US-listed 
business focus.

Our Statement of compliance summarises how the Group has 
applied the principles of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code 
(available at frc.org.uk/library/standards-codes-policy/corporate-
governance/uk-corporate-governance-code/ under UK Corporate 
Governance Code) as published in July 2018 (the Code) and 
comments on compliance with the Code’s provisions.

This should be read in conjunction with the Strategic Report 
on pages 2 to 88, and Governance, including the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, on pages 89 to 140, as a whole.

The Board considers that the Group has complied in all material 
respects with the Code’s provisions for the year ended 31 December 
2023, save as noted below in section 5 P (Remuneration policies and 
practices) in respect of provision 38.

1.   Board Leadership and Company Purpose

E.  Workforce policies and practices

A.  The role of the Board

The Board continues to lead the Group’s strategic direction and 
long-term objectives. Further responsibilities of the Board are set 
out on page 100.

The Board met eight times during 2023 and all Directors continue 
to act in what they consider to be the best interests of the Company, 
consistent with their statutory duties. Further details of 2023 Board 
meetings, including information on matters discussed and decisions 
taken by the Board, are set out on pages 101 to 103; attendance 
information is on page 96; and skills and experience and 
biographical information is on pages 92 to 95.

A description of IHG’s business model is set out on pages 10 to 13. 
An assessment of the principal risks facing the Group is included on 
pages 42 to 49.

Potential conflicts of interest are reviewed annually and powers of 
authorisation are exercised in accordance with the Companies Act 
and the Company’s Articles of Association.

During the year, if any Director has unresolved concerns about the 
operation of the Board or the management of the Company, these 
would be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

B.  The Company’s purpose, values and strategy

Our purpose is to provide True Hospitality for Good. A description 
of our culture, including an overview of our values and information 
on how the Board ensures alignment between our purpose, 
values and strategy and our culture, is included on pages 38 to 41. 
A summary of the Board’s activities in relation to the Voice of the 
Employee is included on page 113. Information on the Group’s 
approach to rewarding its workforce is contained on pages 29 to 30 
and 123 and 124.

C.  Resources

The Board delegates oversight of the allocation of day-to-day resources 
to management (principally through the Executive Committee).

Information on the Group’s key performance indicators, including 
the measures used to monitor them, is included on pages 60 to 63.

A summary of the procedures for identifying and discussing emerging 
risks is set out on pages 42 to 49.

D.  Shareholders and stakeholders

The Board engaged actively throughout 2023 with shareholders 
and other stakeholders. The Chair held a number of meetings with 
major institutional shareholders to discuss the role of the Board and 
other general governance issues, following which the Chair ensured 
that their views were communicated to the Board as a whole. 
The (then) Chair of the Remuneration Committee also engaged 
extensively with shareholders during the year. Further details are 
on page 125.

Information on the Board’s consideration of and engagement with 
other stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, hotel owners 
and guests, is included on pages 36 and 37.

The Board has overarching responsibility for the Group’s workforce 
policies and practices and delegates day-to-day responsibility to 
the CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer to ensure that they 
are consistent with the Company’s values and support its 
long-term success.

Employees are able to report matters of concern confidentially 
through our Confidential Disclosure Channel. The Board routinely 
reviews reports generated from the disclosures and ensures that 
arrangements are in place for investigation and follow-up action 
as appropriate.

2.  Division of Responsibilities

F.  The Chair

Deanna Oppenheimer leads the operation and governance of the 
Board and its Committees. The Chair has been in post since 
September 2022 and was independent on appointment.

G.  Board composition

The size and composition of the Board and its Committees are kept 
under review by the Nomination Committee to ensure the appropriate 
combination of Executive and Non-Executive Directors. Details of 
the composition of the Board and Committees are available on 
pages 92 to 96.

At least half of the Board, excluding the Chair, are Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Provision 10 of the Code considers the 
independence of Non-Executive Directors and circumstances that 
might impair their independence, including holding office for over 
nine years. Jo Harlow reached a nine-year tenure in September 
2023, before retiring from the Board on 31 December 2023. In light 
of Jo’s role as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, the Board 
considered a slight extension to her nine-year tenure as appropriate 
to facilitate an orderly transition to Angie Risley, who succeeded Jo 
as Chair of the Remuneration Committee from 1 January 2024.

The Board carefully considered Jo’s contributions and commitments 
in light of her extended tenure, and concluded that she remained 
independent.

H.  Non-Executives

Non-Executive Director terms of appointment outline IHG’s time 
commitment expectations required to fulfil their role.

The commitments of each Director are included in the Directors’ 
biographical details on pages 92 to 95. Details of Non-Executive 
Director appointment terms are set out on page 125.

The Chair annually reviews the time each Non-Executive Director 
dedicates to IHG as part of the performance evaluation of Directors 
(see page 106) and is satisfied that their other duties and time 
commitments do not conflict with those as Directors.

Graham Allan is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID). 
The SID provides a sounding board for the Chair and serves as an 
intermediary for the other Directors and shareholders. Graham also 
led the annual performance review of the Chair (see page 106).

After each Board meeting, Non-Executive Directors and the Chair 
meet without Executive Directors being present.

I.  Policies, processes, information and resources

N.  Assessment of the Company’s position and prospects

The Chair and Company Secretary ensure that the Board and its 
Committees have the necessary policies and processes in place and 
that they receive timely, accurate and clear information. The Board

independent advice and other necessary resources, at the Company’s 
expense. They receive the administrative and logistical support of 
a full-time executive assistant. 

3.  Composition, Succession and Evaluation

J.  Appointments

Appointments to the Board are led by the Nomination Committee 
in accordance with its Terms of Reference (available on our website 
at ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate governance).

The Nomination Committee also supports the Board in succession 
planning for the Board and senior management. Further details of 
the role of the Nomination Committee and what it did in 2023 are 
in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 114 and 115.

The overall process of appointment and removal of Directors is 
overseen by the Board as a whole.

All of the Directors retire and seek election or re-election at each AGM.

K.  Skills

Details of the skills, experience and biographical information of the 
Board are set out on pages 92 to 95.

The Chair and Company Secretary ensure that new Directors receive 
a full induction, and that all Directors continually update their skills 
and have the requisite knowledge and familiarity with the Group to 
fulfil their role (see page 104).

The length of service of Non-Executive Directors is reviewed regularly.

L.  Annual evaluation

The Board undertakes either an internal or external annual Board 
effectiveness evaluation. In 2023, the Board undertook an external 
evaluation. Details of the process and results of the evaluation are 
included on pages 104 to 106.

Performance evaluations of Directors, including the Chair, are also 
carried out on an annual basis. Directors’ biographies are set out on 
pages 92 to 95, and details of performance evaluations carried out 
in 2023 are on page 106.

4.  Audit, Risk and Internal Control

M.  Audit functions

The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors (see page 96 for membership details).

Byron Grote, the Audit Committee’s Chair, has recent and relevant 
financial experience, and the Committee as a whole has 
competence relevant to the sector in which we operate. Details of 
the Committee’s role, responsibilities and activities are set out on 
pages 107 to 111.

The Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
Internal Audit function and also assessed PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP’s performance during 2023, including its independence, 
effectiveness and objectivity. Details of these reviews are set out 
in the Audit Committee Report on pages 107 to 109.

The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities (including the Board’s 
statement confirming that it considers that the Annual Report and 
Form 20-F, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s position, performance, business model and strategy) 
is set out on page 144.

The status of IHG as a going concern is set out in the Directors’ 
Report on page 241. An explanation of the Group’s performance, 
business model, strategy and the risks and uncertainties relating to 
IHG’s prospects, including the viability of the Group, is set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 2 to 88.

O.  Risk management

The Board determines the nature and extent of the principal risks 
the organisation is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives. 
The Board completed an assessment of the principal and emerging 
risks facing the Group during the year, including those risks that 
would threaten the Group’s business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity and reputation (see pages 42 to 49 for further 
details of the principal risks). The Board and Audit Committee 
monitor the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems 
and conduct an annual review of their effectiveness. Throughout the 
year, the Board has directly, and through delegated authority to the 
Executive Committee and the Audit Committee, overseen and 
reviewed all material controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls. See pages 42 to 49 and 107 to 109.

5.  Remuneration

P.  Remuneration policies and practices

The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy 
on executive remuneration and determining remuneration packages 
of Directors and senior management. The Directors’ Remuneration 
Report is set out on pages 116 to 140. Details of the Remuneration 
Committee’s focus areas during 2023 are set out on page 125 and 
its membership details are on pages 96 and 118.

Provision 38 of the Code states that pension contribution rates for 
executive Directors should be aligned with those available to the 
workforce. As explained in the Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019, 
this was to be the case for new UK appointments and (then) existing 
UK Executive Directors from January 2023. US retirement benefit 
arrangements differ in a number of ways from the UK and include 
a Deferred Compensation Plan for senior employees.

Given the importance of the CEO, Americas’ role to the business and 
the market competitiveness concerns over Executive Director pay, 
the arrangements as they related to Elie Maalouf in his role as CEO, 
Americas were maintained up to the end of his tenure in that role on 
30 June 2023. With effect from 1 July 2023, Elie was promoted to 
Group CEO and transferred to a UK pension basis. As such, effective 
from 1 July 2023, the pension arrangements for Executive Directors 
are now in line with Provision 38 of the Code. Further details can be 
found on pages 123 and 126.

Q.  Procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration

Details of how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (DR Policy) was 
implemented in 2023 are set out on pages 128 to 137.

During 2023, no individual Director was involved in deciding his 
or her own remuneration outcome.

R. 

Independent judgement and discretion
The Remuneration Committee has formal discretions in place in 
relation to outcomes under the Deferred Award Plan rules, and these 
are disclosed as part of the DR Policy. When determining outcomes 
under incentive plans, the Committee considers whether it is 
appropriate to adjust outcomes under these discretions, taking 
account of the Group’s performance, relative performance against 
competitors and other relevant factors. Information on the 
Remuneration Committee’s consideration of the use of discretion 
during 2023 is set out on page 132.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities

Financial Statements and accounting records 
The Directors are required to prepare the Annual Report and Form 
20-F and the Financial Statements for the Company and the Group 
at the end of each financial year in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. Under company law, directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group 
and the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The Directors have 
prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with 
UK-adopted international accounting standards and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). The Company Financial 
Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK accounting 
standards, comprising Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ (‘FRS 101’), and applicable law.

In preparing these Financial Statements, IHG Directors are required to: 

•  select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently; 

•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable; 

•  state whether the Consolidated Financial Statements have 

been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards;

•  state for the Company Financial Statements whether applicable 

UK accounting standards, comprising FRS 101, have been 
followed; and 

•  prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 

unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the 
Group will continue in business.

The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company 
and the Group keep adequate accounting records sufficient to 
show and explain the Company’s and the Group’s transactions, and 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the 
Company and the Group to enable them to ensure that the Financial 
Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. 

The Directors are also responsible for the system of internal control, 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group, and 
taking reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.

Disclosure of information to Auditor 
The Directors who held office as at the date of approval of this 
report confirm that they have taken steps to make themselves aware 
of relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418(3) of the 
Companies Act 2006). None of the Directors are aware of any 
relevant audit information that has not been disclosed to the 
Company’s and Group’s Auditor.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting for the Group, as defined in 
Rule 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRSs. 

The Group’s internal control over financial reporting includes 
policies and procedures that: 

•  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 

accurately and fairly reflect the Group’s transactions and 
dispositions of assets; 

•  are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions 

are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards and IFRSs as issued by the 
IASB, and that receipts and expenditure are being made only in 
accordance with authorisation of management and the Directors 
of the Company; and 

•  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 

detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Group’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Any internal control framework has inherent limitations and 
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness 
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control over financial reporting at 
31 December 2023 based on criteria established in the Internal 
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). 

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as 
at 31 December 2023 the Group’s internal control over financial 
reporting was effective. 

During the period covered by this document there were no changes 
in the Group’s internal control over financial reporting that have 
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the 
effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting. 

The Group’s internal control over financial reporting at 31 December 
2023, together with the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements, 
were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent 
registered public accounting firm. Their auditor’s report can be 
found on page 151.

Independent auditors’ report to the members 
of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC 

Report on the audit of the Financial Statements

Opinion
In our opinion:

•  InterContinental Hotels Group PLC’s Group Financial Statements 

and Parent Company Financial Statements (the “Financial 
Statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the Parent Company’s affairs at 31 December 2023 and 
of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;

•  the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006;

•  the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law); and

•  the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 

the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the Financial Statements, included within the 
Annual Report and Form 20-F (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the Group and Parent Company statements of financial 
position at 31 December 2023; the Group income statement, Group 
statement of comprehensive income, Group statement of cash flows 
and Group and Parent Company statements of changes in equity for 
the year then ended; the accounting policies; and the notes to the 
Financial Statements.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in the accounting policies, the Group, in addition to 
applying UK-adopted international accounting standards, has also 
applied international financial reporting standards (“IFRSs”) as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).

In our opinion, the Group Financial Statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the auditors’ 
responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of 
our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Financial 
Statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as 
applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in note 5 to the Group Financial 
Statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Parent 
Company or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.

Our audit approach
Overview
Audit scope
•  PwC component audit teams were engaged to perform a full 

scope audit in the US and specified procedures over transactions 
processed at the Group’s Global Business Service Centre in India. 
The Group audit team carried out audit procedures over the 
consolidation and material balances and transactions processed 
centrally. The territories where we conducted audit procedures, 
together with work performed at corporate functions and at the 
Group level, accounted for approximately: 90% of the Group’s 
revenue; 85% of the Group’s statutory profit before tax; and 78% 
of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items and 
the System Fund.

•  The Group audit team performed substantive procedures over all 
of the material balances and transactions of the Parent Company.

Key audit matters
•  Breakage assumption used to estimate IHG One Rewards deferred 

revenue (Group)

•  Allocation of expenses to the System Fund (Group)

•  Recognition of the UK deferred tax asset (Group and Parent Company)

Materiality
•  Overall Group materiality: $48.0 million (2022: $37.0 million) based 
on approximately 5% of profit before tax adjusted for exceptional 
items and the System Fund

•  Overall Parent Company materiality: £21.9 million (2022: £14.8 million) 

based on approximately 1% of net assets

•  Performance materiality: $36.0 million (2022: $27.7 million) (Group) 

and £16.4 million (2022: £11.1 million) (Parent Company)

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed 
the risks of material misstatement in the Financial Statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the Financial 
Statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. The key audit matters below 
are consistent with last year.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Breakage assumption used to estimate IHG One Rewards deferred revenue (Group)

At 31 December 2023, the deferred revenue balance relating to the IHG One Rewards 
loyalty programme was $1,529m (2022: $1,411m).

The loyalty programme, IHG One Rewards, enables members to earn points during 
each qualifying stay at an IHG branded hotel and through other partnerships and 
programmes. Members are able to consume those points at a later date for free or 
reduced accommodation or other benefits. Points revenue includes hotel assessments, 
revenue from third-party partners and proceeds from points purchased directly by 
members. The Group recognises deferred revenue in an amount that reflects the 
Group’s unsatisfied performance obligations, valued at the stand-alone selling price 
of the future benefit to the member. The amount of revenue recognised and deferred 
is impacted by the estimate of breakage (i.e. points that will never be consumed). 
On an annual basis, the Group engages an external actuary who uses statistical 
formulae to assist in the estimate of breakage. In 2022 and 2021, the breakage 
estimate was formed using pre Covid-19 behaviour patterns as a base, but giving 
some weight to activity since 2020 and incorporating the impact of 2022 programme 
changes. In 2023, the breakage estimate has been formed without any equivalent 
adjustment, reflecting normalising patterns of redemption behaviour.

Significant estimation uncertainty exists in projecting members’ future consumption 
activity. A small change in the breakage assumption would result in a material difference 
in the deferred revenue balance at 31 December 2023 and therefore in the revenue 
recognised in the year.

Refer to the estimates section of the accounting policies and to note 3 to the Group 
Financial Statements for management’s disclosures.

Allocation of expenses to the System Fund (Group)

The Group operates a System Fund to collect and administer cash assessments 
from hotel owners for specified purposes of use including marketing, reservations 
and the Group’s loyalty programme, IHG One Rewards. Costs that are incurred are 
allocated to the System Fund in accordance with the principles agreed with the IHG 
Owners Association. For the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group recorded 
System Fund expenses of $1,545m (2022: $1,322m).

System Fund expenses are excluded from the Group result to determine operating 
profit from reportable segments, a key metric used by the Group.

There is judgement involved in developing the Group’s internal policies in order to 
apply the principles agreed with the IHG Owners Association to expenses incurred 
and there is complexity in subsequently evaluating whether expenses are appropriately 
allocated to the System Fund in line with these internal policies.

Refer to the accounting policies and to note 32 to the Group Financial Statements 
for management’s disclosures.

We evaluated and tested the design and operation of key controls in 
place over management’s determination of the breakage assumption.

We tested a sample of data used by management’s external actuary in 
deriving the breakage assumption to underlying records. We assessed 
the competence and objectivity of management’s actuary and we 
understood the methods and assumptions adopted by it in determining 
breakage. We deployed our own actuarial experts to develop an 
independent expectation of a reasonably possible range for deferred 
revenue based on independently determined breakage assumptions. 
We compared the deferred revenue balance, which no longer includes 
a Covid-19 adjustment, with our independently calculated range.

We assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures including 
sensitivity analysis in the estimates section of the accounting policies 
and in note 3 to the Group Financial Statements.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
arising from our work.

We evaluated and tested the design and operation of key controls 
over the allocation of expenses to the System Fund.

We understood and assessed the internal policies and governance 
structure that the Group has put in place in order to apply the 
principles agreed with the IHG Owners Association to expenses 
incurred. We inspected correspondence and minutes of meetings 
with the IHG Owners Association to identify whether allocations 
have been challenged or disputed. For a sample of cost centres, 
we validated the basis for any changes in the proportion of costs 
allocated to the System Fund compared to the prior year. We tested 
a sample of expenses that had been allocated to the System Fund to 
assess whether they were accurately calculated, in compliance with 
the Group’s internal policies and consistent with historical practice.

We checked whether there were any manual journal entries that 
transferred expenses to the System Fund to evaluate whether there 
was an appropriate rationale for any such journals. We determined 
whether the resulting classification of expenses was in line with the 
principles agreed with the IHG Owners Association.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
arising from our work.

Recognition of the UK deferred tax asset (Group and Parent Company)

At 31 December 2023, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of $113m (2022: 
$109m) related to the UK tax group. The Parent Company, which is part of the UK tax 
group, recognised a deferred tax asset of £43m (2022: £40m). The assets largely 
represent brought forward revenue tax losses. The asset recognised by the Group 
also includes future tax deductions for amortisation.

Judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets, particularly 
in respect of tax losses, should be recognised. Deferred tax assets are only recognised 
to the extent that it is regarded as probable that there will be sufficient and suitable 
taxable profits or deferred tax liabilities in the relevant legal entity or tax group against 
which such assets can be utilised in the future. Tax assumptions are overlaid to profit 
forecasts to estimate the future taxable profits. This process has demonstrated that the 
UK deferred tax assets should reverse over a seven to ten year period, with the lower 
end of the range based on the Group’s base case forecast and the upper end of the 
range based on the Group’s severe downside case forecast. The losses do not expire, 
although they can only be offset against 50% of annual UK taxable profits. The Group’s 
TCFD disclosures describe how physical and transitional climate risks present both 
risks and opportunities for the Group. The potential downside risks have been 
considered in the context of the UK deferred tax asset recoverability assessment, 
without taking account of opportunities or mitigating actions.

Refer to note 8 to the Group Financial Statements and note 5 to the Parent Company 
Financial Statements for management’s disclosures.

We evaluated and tested the design and operation of key controls in 
place over the recognition of deferred tax assets and over the Group’s 
forecasting process.

We evaluated the appropriateness of the assumptions reflected in 
the UK forecasts, including assessing the reasonableness of growth 
projections compared to historical experience and industry data. 
As part of this assessment, we benchmarked management’s 
estimates to third-party sources and we considered how climate 
risk had been incorporated.

We deployed tax specialists to assess the appropriateness of tax 
overlay adjustments applied to the forecasts by reference to the 
requirements of tax principles, including the restriction of losses to 
50% of annual UK taxable profits, and to assess whether the UK 
deferred tax assets met the recognition criteria of IAS 12.

We assessed the reasonableness of the recovery period of seven 
to ten years.

We assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in note 8 
to the Group Financial Statements and note 5 to the Parent Company 
Financial Statements.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues 
arising from our work.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the Financial 
Statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the 
Group and the Parent Company, the accounting processes and 
controls and the industry in which they operate.

The Group Financial Statements are a consolidation of over 
450 reporting units. The Group operates a Global Business Service 
Centre (“BSC”) in India which processes transactions for the majority 
of the Group’s reporting units. We identified one aggregation of 
components in the US which required a full scope audit due to its 
size and because this aggregated component holds the IHG One 
Rewards loyalty programme and System Fund. We engaged a PwC 
component audit team in the US to carry out this audit. We also 
instructed our US component team to undertake specified 
procedures over certain balances and transactions in certain other 
US reporting units. We engaged a second PwC component audit 
team in India to undertake testing of transactions processed by the 
BSC encompassing all reporting units within the BSC’s scope.

Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined 
the appropriate level of involvement we needed to have in that audit 
work to ensure that we could conclude that sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence had been obtained for the Group Financial 
Statements as a whole. In addition to instructing and reviewing 
the reporting from our component audit teams, we conducted file 
reviews and participated in key meetings with local management. 
We made one site visit to the US and one site visit to India to meet 
with our component teams and local management in person and 
we supplemented these site visits with regular dialogue with 
component teams throughout the year.

The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and certain 
balances and transactions processed centrally by management in the 
UK, including certain Parent Company balances and transactions that 
were included in Group audit scope, were audited by the Group audit 
team. This included taxation, treasury, impairment reviews and elements 
of expected credit losses on trade receivables. Taken together, the 
audit procedures carried out by the Group and component audit teams 
provided coverage of 90% of the Group’s revenue, 85% of the Group’s 
statutory profit before tax and 78% of the Group’s profit before tax 
adjusted for exceptional items and the System Fund. This provided 
the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group Financial 
Statements taken as a whole. This was before considering the 
contribution to our audit evidence from performing audit work at the 
Group level, including disaggregated analytical review procedures, 
which covered certain of the Group’s smaller and lower risk 
components that were not directly included in our Group audit scope.

Our audit of the Parent Company Financial Statements was 
undertaken by the Group audit team and included substantive 
procedures over all material balances and transactions.

The impact of climate risk on our audit
As part of our audit, we made enquiries of management to 

understand the process that management adopted, with input from 
its third party expert on climate change, to assess the extent of the 
potential impact of climate risk on the Financial Statements and to 
support the disclosures made within the climate change section of 
the accounting policies. Using our knowledge of the business, we 
challenged the completeness of management’s risk assessment. 
This included reading Carbon Disclosure Project submissions made by 
the Group and its competitors to ensure appropriate consistency with 
the judgements and disclosures reflected in the Financial Statements.

Management considers that there are no climate-related estimates 
or assumptions that have a material impact on the Financial 
Statements. We assessed that the key areas in the Financial 
Statements which are more likely to be materially impacted by 
climate change are impairment of non-financial assets, recognition 
of deferred tax assets and going concern.

We tailored our audit approach to respond to the audit risks 
identified in these areas. In particular, we:

•  Challenged management on how the Group’s commitment to 
reduce emissions from its hotel estate by 46% by 2030 from a 
2019 baseline will impact the assumptions within the discounted 
cash flows prepared by management that are used in the Group’s 
impairment analysis, for assessing the recognition of deferred tax 
assets and for going concern purposes;

•  Evaluated whether the impact of both physical and transition 

risks arising due to climate risk had been appropriately reflected 
by management in the estimates of the recoverable value of the 
Group’s non-financial assets including the discounted cash flows 
prepared by management for impairment assessment purposes; and

•  Checked whether the impact of climate risk in the directors’ 

assessments and disclosures related to going concern and viability 
were consistent with management’s climate impact assessment.

We also considered the consistency of the disclosures in relation 
to climate change (including the disclosures in the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) section) in the Annual 
Report with the Financial Statements and with our knowledge 
obtained from our audit.

Our procedures did not identify any material impact in the context 
of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole or on our key 
audit matters for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. 
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of 
our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures 
on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and 
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in 
aggregate on the Financial Statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for 
the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:

How we 
determined it

Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied

Group Financial Statements

Overall materiality

$48.0 million (2022: $37.0 million)

Approximately 5% of profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items and the 
System Fund

Parent Company Financial Statements

£21.9 million (2022: £14.8 million)

Approximately 1% of net assets

The Group’s principal measure of performance is operating profit from reportable 
segments, which excludes exceptional items and the System Fund result, in order 
to present results from operating activities on a consistent basis and to exclude the 
impact of the System Fund, which is not managed to generate a profit or loss for the 
Group over the longer term. We took this measure into account in determining our 
materiality as it is the metric against which the performance of the Group is most 
commonly assessed by management and reported to shareholders. From operating 
profit from reportable segments, we deducted net financial expenses and fair value 
losses on contingent purchase consideration to arrive at adjusted profit before tax.

InterContinental Hotels Group PLC is the 
ultimate parent company which holds the 
Group’s investments and bonds. The strength 
of the balance sheet is the key measure of 
financial health that is important to shareholders 
since the primary concern for the Parent 
Company is the payment of dividends. 
We therefore considered net assets to be 
an appropriate benchmark.

Group Financial Statements

Independent Auditor’s UK Report continued

For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated 
a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was approximately 
$3.8 million to $45.6 million.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, 
we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit 
and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes 
of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample 
sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of overall 
materiality, amounting to $36.0 million (2022: $27.7 million) for the 
Group Financial Statements and £16.4 million (2022: £11.1 million) 
for the Parent Company Financial Statements.

In determining performance materiality, we considered a number of 
factors, including the history of misstatements, risk assessment and 
aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls and we concluded 
that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above $2.4 million 
(Group) (2022: $1.8 million) and £1.0 million (Parent Company) (2022: 
£0.7 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in 
our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to going concern
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting included:

•  Evaluation and testing of key controls over the Group’s budgeting 

process and the assessment of going concern;

•  Evaluation of management’s Base Case and Severe Downside Case 
scenarios and reverse stress testing calculations, understanding 
and evaluating the key assumptions, including assumptions related 
to RevPAR growth;

•  Validation that the cash flow forecasts used to support 

In auditing the Financial Statements, we have concluded that 
the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the Financial Statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the directors’ reporting on how they have applied the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add 
or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the 
Financial Statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with 
respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections 
of this report.

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual 
Report other than the Financial Statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify 
an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we 
are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is 
a material misstatement of the Financial Statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

management’s impairment, deferred tax asset recoverability, going 
concern and viability assessments were consistent and in line with 
the Group’s Board approved plan;

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also 
considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below.

Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the 
Financial Statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report.

Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.

•  Assessment of the historical accuracy and reasonableness of 

management’s forecasting;

•  Identification of RevPAR as the key assumption inherent in 
management’s cash flow forecasts and validation of this 
assumption to industry sources;

•  Consideration of the Group’s available financing and debt maturity 

profile and evaluation of the reasonableness of management’s 
assumption that bank facilities will remain undrawn over the period 
of the going concern assessment;

•  Testing of the mathematical integrity of management’s models and 
liquidity headroom, covenant compliance, sensitivity and reverse 
stress testing calculations;

•  Assessment of the reasonableness of management’s planned or 

potential mitigating actions;

•  Consideration of whether climate change is expected to have any 

significant impact during the period of the going concern 
assessment; and

•  Review of the related disclosures in the Annual Report.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any 
material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s 
and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for 
a period of at least twelve months from when the Financial 
Statements are authorised for issue.

Corporate governance statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statements in 
relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the 
corporate governance statement relating to the Parent Company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with

Responsibilities for the Financial Statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the Financial Statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial 
Statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have 
concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate 
governance statement, included within the Statement of compliance 
is materially consistent with the Financial Statements and our 
knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material 
to add or draw attention to in relation to:

•  The directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust 

assessment of the emerging and principal risks;

•  The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal 
risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and 
an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

•  The directors’ statement in the Financial Statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the Financial Statements;

•  The directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group’s 
and Parent Company’s prospects, the period this assessment 
covers and why the period is appropriate; and

•  The directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable 

expectation that the Parent Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term 
viability of the Group and Parent Company was substantially less 
in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and 
considering the directors’ process supporting their statement; 
checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering 
whether the statement is consistent with the Financial Statements 
and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we 
have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate 
governance statement is materially consistent with the Financial 
Statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

•  The directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, 

taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for the members to assess the 
Group’s and Parent Company’s position, performance, business 
model and strategy;

•  The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of 

effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; 
and

•  The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the 

Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report 
when the directors’ statement relating to the Parent Company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing 
Rules for review by the auditors.

In preparing the Financial Statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group 
or the Parent Company or to cease operations or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance 
with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements 
in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our 
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, 
is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the Group and industry in which it 
operates, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance 
with laws and regulations related to the failure to comply with 
employment laws and regulations and we considered the extent to 
which non-compliance might have a material effect on the Financial 
Statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that 
have a direct impact on the Financial Statements such as the Listing 
Rules, UK and overseas tax legislation and the Companies Act 2006. 
We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for 
fraudulent manipulation of the Financial Statements (including the 
risk of override of controls) and we determined that the principal 
risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries and 
management bias in allocating expenses to the System Fund and in 
accounting for key estimates. The Group audit team shared this risk 
assessment with the component auditors so that they could include 
appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. 
Audit procedures performed by the Group audit team and/or 
component auditors included:

•  Inquiries of management, internal audit and the Group’s legal 

counsel, including considerations of known or suspected instances 
of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;

•  Review of correspondence received, if any, from regulators and 

consideration of the impact on our audit and the disclosures made 
in the Financial Statements;

•  Evaluation and testing of the effectiveness of management’s 

controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;

•  Assessment of matters reported on the Group’s whistleblowing 

helpline and the results of management’s investigation of 
such matters;

Group Financial Statements

Independent Auditor’s UK Report continued

•  Identification and testing of significant manual journal entries, 

in particular any journal entries which resulted in an increase to 
revenue from fee business or from owned, leased and managed 
lease hotels through unusual account combinations and any 
journal entries which resulted in a reduction to the System Fund 
result; and

Other required reporting

Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:

•  We have not obtained all the information and explanations we 

•  Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management 

require for our audit; or

in making significant accounting estimates.

•  Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described 
above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related 
to events and transactions reflected in the Financial Statements. 
Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud 
is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery 
or intentional misrepresentations or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of 
certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing 
techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number 
of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. 
We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on 
their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit 
sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population 
from which the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the Financial Statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part 
of our auditors’ report.

Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or

•  Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 

are not made; or

•  The Parent Company Financial Statements and the part of the 

Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were 
appointed by the members at the Annual General Meeting on 
7 May 2021 to audit the Financial Statements for the year ended 
31 December 2021 and subsequent financial periods. The period of 
total uninterrupted engagement is three years, covering the years 
ended 31 December 2021 to 31 December 2023.

Other matters

In due course, as required by the Financial Conduct Authority 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, these Financial 
Statements will form part of the ESEF-prepared annual financial 
report filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the Financial 
Conduct Authority in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory 
Technical Standard (“ESEF RTS”). This auditors’ report provides no 
assurance over whether the annual financial report will be prepared 
using the single electronic format specified in the ESEF RTS.

Report of Independent Registered Public 
Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of InterContinental 
Hotels Group PLC 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying Group statements of financial 
position of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and its subsidiaries 
(the “Group”) as of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 and 
the related Group income statements and Group statements of 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each 
of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2023, including 
the accounting policies and the related notes (collectively referred 
to as the “Group Financial Statements”). We also have audited the 
Group’s internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 
2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated 
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the Group Financial Statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the 
Group as of 31 December 2023 and 2022 and the results of its 
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended 31 December 2023 in conformity with (i) International 
Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board and (ii) UK-adopted International 
Accounting Standards. Also in our opinion, the Group maintained, 
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial 
reporting as of 31 December 2023, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 

Basis for Opinions
The Group’s management is responsible for these Group Financial 
Statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial 
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
control over financial reporting, included in management’s report 
on internal control over financial reporting on page 144. 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Group Financial 
Statements and on the Group’s internal control over financial 
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with 
respect to the Group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities 
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of 
the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Group 
Financial Statements are free of material misstatement, whether due 
to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the Group Financial Statements included performing 
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the Group 
Financial Statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing 
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and 
disclosures in the Group Financial Statements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the Group Financial Statements. Our audit of internal 
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding 
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as 
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only 
in accordance with authorisations of management and directors 
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the 
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising 
from the current period audit of the Group Financial Statements 
that were communicated or required to be communicated to the 
audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that 
are material to the Group Financial Statements and (ii) involved 
our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgements. 
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any 
way our opinion on the Group Financial Statements, taken as a 
whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters 
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or 
on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Allocation of expenses to the System Fund
As described in the System Fund and other co-brand revenues 
section of the Accounting policies and in Note 32 to the Group 
Financial Statements, the Group recorded System Fund expenses of 
$1,545m for the year ended 31 December 2023. The Group operates 
a System Fund to collect and administer cash assessments from 
hotel owners for specified purposes of use including marketing, 
reservations and the Group’s loyalty programme, IHG One Rewards. 
Costs are incurred and allocated to the System Fund in accordance 
with the principles agreed with the IHG Owners Association. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing 
procedures relating to the allocation of expenses to the System 
Fund is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgement by 
management when developing the Group’s internal policies in order 
to apply the principles agreed with the IHG Owners Association 
to expenses incurred; and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgement, 
subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the 
appropriateness of management’s classification of expenses to 
the System Fund in line with the agreed principles.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and 
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall 
opinion on the Group Financial Statements. These procedures 
included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to allocation 
of expenses to the System Fund. These procedures also included, 
among others, (i) understanding and assessing the internal policies 
that the Group has put in place in order to apply the principles 
agreed with the IHG Owners Association to expenses incurred; 
(ii) inspecting correspondence and minutes of meetings with the 
IHG Owners Association to identify whether allocations have been 
challenged or disputed; (iii) validating for a sample of cost centres 
the basis for any changes in the proportion of costs allocated to 
the System Fund compared to the prior year; (iv) testing a sample 
of expenses that had been allocated to the System Fund to assess 
whether they were accurately calculated, in compliance with the 
Group’s internal policies and consistent with historical practice; 
(v) checking whether there were any manual journal entries that 
transferred expenses to the System Fund to evaluate whether there 
was an appropriate rationale for any such journals; and (vi) determining 
whether the resulting classification of the expenses was in line with 
the principles agreed with the IHG Owners Association.

Breakage assumption used to estimate IHG One Rewards 
loyalty programme deferred revenue
As described in the Estimates section of the Accounting policies 
and in Note 3 to the Group Financial Statements, deferred revenue 
relating to the IHG One Rewards loyalty programme was $1,529m 
as of 31 December 2023. The hotel loyalty programme, IHG One 
Rewards, enables members to earn points during each qualifying 
stay at an IHG branded hotel and through other partnerships and 
programmes. Members are able to consume those points at a 
later date for free or reduced accommodation or other benefits. 
Points revenue includes hotel assessments, revenue from third-party 
partners and proceeds from points purchased directly by members. 
The Group recognises deferred revenue in an amount that reflects 
the Group’s unsatisfied performance obligations, valued at the 
stand-alone selling price of the future benefit to the member. 
The amount of revenue recognised and deferred is impacted by 
the estimate of breakage (points that will never be consumed). 
On an annual basis, the Group engages an external actuary who 
uses statistical formulae to assist in the estimate of breakage. 
Significant estimation uncertainty exists in projecting members’ 
future consumption activity. In 2022 and 2021, the breakage estimate 
was formed using pre Covid-19 behaviour patterns as a base, but 
giving some weight to activity since 2020 and incorporating the 
impact of 2022 programme changes. In 2023, the breakage estimate 
has been formed without any equivalent adjustment, reflecting 
normalising patterns of redemption behaviour. If future member 
behaviour deviates significantly from expectations, breakage 
estimates could increase or decrease.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing 
procedures relating to the breakage assumption used to estimate 
IHG One Rewards loyalty programme deferred revenue is a critical 
audit matter are (i) the significant judgement by management when 
projecting members’ future consumption of points; (ii) a high degree 
of auditor judgement, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures 
and evaluating management’s breakage assumption; and (iii) the 
audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialised skill 
and knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and 
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall 
opinion on the Group Financial Statements. These procedures included 
testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s 
determination of the breakage assumption. These procedures also 
included, among others, (i) testing a sample of data used by 
management’s external actuary in deriving the breakage assumption 
to underlying records; (ii) assessing the competence and objectivity 
of management’s actuary and understanding the methods and 
assumptions adopted by it in determining breakage; (iii) developing 
an independent expectation of a reasonably possible range for 
deferred revenue based on independently determined breakage 
assumptions; (iv) comparing the deferred revenue balance, which 
no longer includes a Covid-19 adjustment, with our independently 
calculated range; and (v) assessing the appropriateness of the related 
disclosures including sensitivity analysis in the Group Financial 
Statements. Professionals with specialised skill and knowledge were 
used to assist in the evaluation of the breakage assumption.

Recognition of the UK deferred tax asset
As described in the Taxes section of the Accounting policies and 
in Note 8 to the Group Financial Statements, a deferred tax asset 
of $113m was recognised related to the UK tax group as of 
31 December 2023. Judgement is used when assessing the extent 
to which deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, 
should be recognised. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to 
the extent that it is regarded as probable that there will be sufficient 
and suitable taxable profits or deferred tax liabilities in the relevant 
legal entity or tax group against which such assets can be utilised 
in the future. Tax assumptions are overlaid to profit forecasts to 
estimate future taxable profits. This process has demonstrated that 
the UK deferred tax asset should reverse over a seven to ten year 
period, with the lower end of the range based on the Group’s base 
case forecast and the upper end of the range based on the Group’s 
severe downside case forecast. The losses do not expire, although 
they can only be offset against 50% of annual UK taxable profits. 
The Group’s TCFD disclosures describe how physical and transitional 
climate risks present both risks and opportunities for IHG. The 
potential downside risks have been considered in the context of 
the UK deferred tax asset recoverability assessment, without taking 
account of opportunities or mitigating actions.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing 
procedures relating to recognition of the UK deferred tax asset is a 
critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgement by management 
involved in determining the future taxable profits of the UK tax group 
including the impact of climate risk; (ii) a high degree of auditor 
judgement, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and 
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s forecast of a seven 
to ten year period to recover this asset; and (iii) the audit effort 
involved the use of professionals with specialised skill and knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and

opinion on the Group Financial Statements. These procedures 
included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the 
recognition of deferred tax assets and the Group’s forecasting 
process. These procedures also included, among others, 
(i) evaluating the appropriateness of the assumptions reflected in 
the UK forecasts, including assessing the reasonableness of growth 
predictions compared to historical experience and industry data, 
benchmarking management’s estimates to third-party sources and 
considering how climate risk has been incorporated; (ii) assessing 
the appropriateness of tax overlay adjustments applied to the 
forecasts by reference to the requirements of tax principles, 
including the restriction of losses to 50% of annual UK taxable 
profits; (iii) assessing whether the UK deferred tax asset meets the 
recognition criteria of IAS 12; (iv) assessing the appropriateness of 
the forecast recovery period of seven to ten years; and (v) assessing 
the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the Group Financial 
Statements. Professionals with specialised skills and knowledge 
were used to assist in the evaluation of recognition of the UK 
deferred tax asset.

IHG  |  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Accounting policies

General information
The Consolidated Financial Statements of InterContinental Hotels 
Group PLC (the ‘Group’ or ‘IHG’) for the year ended 31 December 2023 
were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
Directors on 19 February 2024. InterContinental Hotels Group PLC 
(the ‘Company’) is incorporated and registered in England and Wales.

Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements of IHG have been prepared 
on a going concern basis (see below) and under the historical cost 
convention, except for assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
under relevant accounting standards. The Consolidated Financial 
Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards and with applicable law and 
regulations, including the Companies Act 2006, and with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). UK-adopted international 
accounting standards differ in certain respects from IFRSs as issued 
by the IASB. However, the differences have no impact on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for the years presented.

Going concern
A period of 18 months has been used, from 1 January 2024 to 
30 June 2025, to complete the going concern assessment. 

In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the Group 
financial statements, the Directors have considered a ‘Base Case’ 
scenario, as prepared by management, which assumes continued 
growth in RevPAR in 2024 and 2025 in line with market expectations. 
The assumptions applied in the Base Case scenario are consistent 
with those used for Group planning purposes, for impairment testing 
(impairment tests adjusted for factors specific to individual properties 
or portfolios) and for assessing recoverability of deferred tax assets. 

The Directors have also reviewed a ‘Severe Downside Case’ which 
is based on a severe but plausible scenario equivalent to the market 
conditions experienced through the 2008/09 global financial crisis. 
This assumes that the performance during 2024 starts to worsen 
and then RevPAR decreases significantly by 17% in 2025. 

A large number of the Group’s principal risks would result in an 
impact on RevPAR, which is one of the sensitivities assessed against 
the headroom available in the Base Case and Severe Downside Case 
scenarios. Climate risks are not considered to have a significant 
impact over the 18-month period of assessment. Other principal 
risks that could result in a large one-off incident that has a material 
impact on cash flow have also been considered, for example a 
cybersecurity event.

A one-year extension to the Group’s revolving credit facility of 
$1,350m was exercised in 2023 and the facility now matures in 
2028. The Group’s key covenant requires net debt:EBITDA below 
4.0x. See note 24 for additional information. In November 2023 
the Group issued a six-year €600m bond. The only debt maturity 
in the period under consideration is the €500m October 2024 
bond which is assumed to be repaid with cash on maturity. 

Under the Base Case and Severe Downside Case, bank covenants 
are not breached and there is significant headroom to the 
covenants to absorb multiple additional risks and uncertainties. 
Additional funding is not required in the period under consideration. 
The Directors also reviewed a number of actions that could be taken 
if required to reduce discretionary spend, creating substantial 
additional headroom to the covenants.

The Directors reviewed a reverse stress test scenario to determine 
what decrease in RevPAR would create a breach of the covenants. 
The Directors concluded that it was very unlikely that a single risk 
or combination of the risks considered could create the sustained 
RevPAR impact required, except for a significant global event. 

The leverage and interest cover covenant tests up to 30 June 2025 
(the last day of the assessment period) have been considered 
as part of the Base Case and Severe Downside Case scenarios. 
Neither of these scenarios indicate that a covenant amendment 
would be required but, in the event that it was, the Directors believe 
it is reasonable to expect that such an amendment could be obtained 
based on experience of negotiating the waivers and amendments in 
2020, however the going concern conclusion is not dependent on 
this expectation. The Group also has alternative options to manage 
this risk including raising additional funding in the capital markets. 

Having reviewed these scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has sufficient resources to continue 
operating until at least 30 June 2025. Accordingly, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 

Presentational currency
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in millions 
of US dollars reflecting the profile of the Group’s revenue and 
operating profit which are primarily generated in US dollars or 
US dollar-linked currencies.

In the Consolidated Financial Statements, equity share capital, 
the capital redemption reserve and shares held by employee share 
trusts are translated into US dollars at the relevant rate of exchange 
on the last day of the period; the resultant exchange differences 
are recorded in other reserves.

The functional currency of the Company is sterling since this is a 
non-trading holding company located in the United Kingdom that 
has sterling denominated share capital and whose primary activity 
is the payment and receipt of sterling dividends and of interest on 
sterling denominated external borrowings and intercompany balances.

Group Financial Statements

Accounting policies continued

Critical accounting policies and the use of judgements, 
estimates and assumptions
In determining and applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
management are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if its 
selection or application could materially affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, or the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period, or could do so within the next 
financial year. 

Judgements
System Fund
The Group operates a System Fund (the ‘Fund’) to collect and 
administer cash assessments from hotel owners for specified 
purposes of use including marketing, reservations and the Group’s 
loyalty programme, IHG One Rewards. Assessments are generally 
levied as a percentage of hotel revenues.

The Fund is not managed to generate a surplus or deficit for IHG over 
the longer term, but is managed for the benefit of the IHG System 
with the objective of driving revenues for the hotels in the System.

In relation to marketing and reservation services, the Group’s 
performance obligation under IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers’ is determined to be the continuous performance of 
the services rather than the spending of the assessments received. 
Accordingly, assessment fees are recognised as hotel revenues 
occur, Fund expenses are charged to the Group income statement 
as incurred and no constructive obligation is deemed to exist under 
IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. 
Accordingly, no liability is recognised relating to the balance of 
unspent funds.

No other critical judgements have been made in applying the Group’s 
accounting policies. 

Estimates
Management consider that significant estimates and assumptions 
are used as described below. Estimates and assumptions are 
evaluated by management using historical experience and other 
factors believed to be reasonable based on current circumstances.

Loyalty programme 
The loyalty programme, IHG One Rewards, enables members to earn 
points during each qualifying stay at an IHG branded hotel and through 
other partnerships and programmes. Members are able to consume 
those points at a later date for free or reduced accommodation or 
other benefits. Points revenue includes hotel assessments, revenue 
from third-party partners and proceeds from points purchased directly 
by members. 

The Group recognises deferred revenue in an amount that reflects 
IHG’s unsatisfied performance obligations, valued at the stand-alone 
selling price of the future benefit to the member. The amount of 
revenue recognised and deferred is impacted by ‘breakage’ (points 
that will never be consumed). On an annual basis the Group engages 
an external actuary who uses statistical formulae to assist in the 
estimate of breakage. 

Significant estimation uncertainty exists in projecting members’ 
future consumption activity. In 2022 and 2021, the breakage estimate 
was formed using pre-Covid-19 behaviour patterns as a base, but 
giving some weight to activity since 2020 and incorporating the 
impact of 2022 programme changes. In 2023, the breakage estimate 
has been formed without any equivalent adjustment, reflecting 
normalising patterns of redemption behaviour. If future member 
behaviour deviates significantly from expectations, breakage 
estimates could increase or decrease. At 31 December 2023, 
deferred revenue relating to the loyalty programme was $1,529m 
(2022: $1,411m, 2021: $1,292m). Based on the conditions existing 
at the balance sheet date, a one percentage point decrease/increase 
in the breakage estimate relating to earned points would increase/
reduce this liability by $75m.

Actuarial gains and losses would correspondingly adjust the amount 
of System Fund and reimbursable revenues recognised and deferred 
revenue in the Group statement of financial position.

Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Parent Company and entities controlled by 
the Group. Control exists when the Group has:

•  power over an investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current 

ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);

•  exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with 

the investee; and

•  the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

All intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated on 
consolidation.

The assets, liabilities and results of those businesses acquired or 
disposed of are consolidated for the period during which they were 
under the Group’s control.

Foreign currencies
Within the Group’s subsidiaries, transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated to the subsidiary’s functional currency at the exchange 
rates ruling on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the 
subsidiary’s functional currency at the relevant rates of exchange 
ruling on the last day of the period. On consolidation:

•  The assets and liabilities of foreign operations of the Group’s 

subsidiaries with a functional currency other than US dollars are 
translated into US dollars at the relevant rates of exchange ruling 
on the last day of the period. The revenues and expenses of foreign 
operations are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange 
for each month of the reporting period. The Group treats specific 
intercompany loan balances, which are not intended to be repaid 
in the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment. The exchange 
differences arising on retranslation are taken to the currency 
translation reserve; and

•  Exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings 

that are designated as a hedge against a net investment in a 
foreign operation are taken to the currency translation reserve. 

On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount 
recognised in the currency translation reserve relating to that 
particular foreign operation is recycled as part of the gain or 
loss on disposal.

Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration 
to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring 
goods or services to a customer. 

Fee business revenue
Under franchise agreements, the Group’s performance obligation 
is to provide a licence to use IHG’s trademarks and other intellectual 
property. Franchise royalty fees are typically charged as a percentage 
of hotel gross rooms revenues and are treated as variable 
consideration, recognised as the underlying hotel revenues occur. 

Under management agreements, the Group’s performance 
obligation is to provide hotel management services and a licence 
to use IHG’s trademarks and other intellectual property. Base and 
incentive management fees are typically charged. Base management 
fees are typically a percentage of total hotel revenues and incentive 
management fees are generally based on the hotel’s profitability or 
cash flows. Both are treated as variable consideration. Like franchise 
fees, base management fees are recognised as the underlying hotel 
revenues occur. Incentive management fees are recognised over 
time when it is considered highly probable that the related 
performance criteria for each annual period will be met, provided 
there is no expectation of a subsequent reversal of the revenue. 

Application and re-licensing fees are not considered to be distinct 
from the franchise performance obligation and are recognised over 
the life of the related agreement. 

Franchise and management agreements also contain a promise 
to provide technology support and network services to hotels. 
A monthly technology fee, based on either gross rooms revenues 
or the number of rooms in the hotel, is charged and recognised 
over time as these services are delivered. Technology fee income 
is included in Central revenue.

Technical service fees are received in relation to design and 
engineering support provided prior to the opening of certain hotel 
properties. These services are a distinct performance obligation 
and the fees are recognised as revenue over the pre-opening period 
in line with the Group’s assessment of the stage of completion of the 
project, based on the latest expectation of hotel opening date and 
its knowledge and experience of the pattern of work performed on 
comparable projects.

The Group has applied the practical expedient in IFRS 15 not to 
disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to 
performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied 
as at the end of the reporting period for all amounts where the 
Group has a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds 
directly with the value to the customer of the Group’s performance 
completed to date (including franchise and management fees).

Contract assets 
Amounts paid to hotel owners to secure management and franchise 
agreements (‘key money’) are treated as consideration payable to 
a customer. A contract asset is recorded which is recognised as 
a deduction to revenue over the initial term of the agreement. 

In limited cases, loans can be provided to an owner, in such cases 
the initial credit risk will be low. The difference, if any, between the 
face and market value of the loan on inception is recognised as 
a contract asset.

In limited cases, the Group may provide performance guarantees 
to third-party hotel owners. The expected value of payments under 
performance guarantees reduces the overall transaction price and is 
recognised as a deduction to revenue over the term of the agreement.

Typically, contract assets are not financial assets as they represent 
amounts paid by the Group at the beginning of a contract, and so 
are tested for impairment based on value in use rather than with 
reference to expected credit losses. Contract assets are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If carrying values 
exceed the recoverable amount, determined by reference to 
estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate, the contract assets are written down to the 
recoverable amount.

Deferred revenue
Deferred revenue is recognised when payment is received before 
the related performance obligation is satisfied.

Revenue is also deferred when key money is committed and is highly 
likely to be paid. The annual revenue deferral is equal to the reduction 
to revenue that would arise if the key money were paid at inception 
of the contract. When payment is made, a net contract asset is 
recorded which is amortised over the remaining initial term of 
the agreement.

Contract costs
Certain costs incurred to secure management and franchise 
agreements, typically developer commissions, are capitalised and 
amortised as an expense over the initial term of the related agreement. 
These costs are presented as contract costs in the Group statement 
of financial position.

Contract costs are reviewed for impairment when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable with reference to the future expected cash flows 
from the contract. 

Revenue from owned, leased and managed lease hotels 
At its owned, leased and managed lease hotels, the Group’s 
performance obligation is to provide accommodation and other 
goods and services to guests. Revenue includes rooms revenue and 
food and beverage sales, which are recognised when the rooms are 
occupied and food and beverages are sold. Guest deposits received 
in advance of hotel stays are recorded as deferred revenue in the 
Group statement of financial position. They are recognised as revenue 
along with any balancing payment from the guest when the associated 
stay occurs, or are returned to the customer in the event of 
a cancellation.

System Fund and reimbursable revenues 
System Fund and other co-brand revenues
The Group operates the Fund to collect and administer cash 
assessments from hotel owners for specified purposes of use 
including marketing, reservations and the Group’s loyalty programme, 
IHG One Rewards. The Fund also benefits from proceeds from the 
sale of loyalty points under third-party co-branding arrangements. 
The Fund is not managed to generate a surplus or deficit for IHG 
over the longer term, but is managed for the benefit of the IHG 
System with the objective of driving revenues for the hotels in 
the System. 

The growth in the IHG One Rewards programme means that, although 
assessments are received from hotels up front when a member 
earns points, more revenue is deferred each year than is recognised 
in the Fund. This can lead to accounting losses in the Fund each year 
as the deferred revenue balance grows.

Under both franchise and management agreements, the Group is 
required to provide marketing and reservations services, as well as 
other centrally managed programmes. These services are provided 
by the Fund and are funded by assessment fees. Costs are incurred 
and allocated to the Fund in accordance with the principles agreed 
with the IHG Owners Association. The Group acts as principal in the 
provision of the services as the related expenses primarily comprise 
payroll and marketing expenses under contracts entered into by the 
Group. The assessment fees from hotel owners are generally levied 
as a percentage of hotel revenues and are recognised as those hotel 
revenues occur. 

Certain travel agency commission revenues within the Fund are 
recognised on a net basis, where it has been determined that IHG 
is acting as agent. 

In respect of IHG One Rewards, the performance obligations are 
to arrange for the provision of future benefits to members on 
consumption of previously earned reward points and Milestone 
Rewards. Points are exchanged for reward nights at an IHG hotel or 
other goods or services provided by third parties. Milestone Rewards 
comprise points or other benefits such as upgrades and food and 
beverage vouchers.

Revenue from a) and b) are reported within System Fund and 
reimbursable revenues and revenue from c) is reported within fee 
business revenue.

Fees from these agreements comprise fixed amounts normally 
payable at the beginning of the contract, and variable amounts 
paid on a monthly basis. Variable amounts are typically based on 
the number of points and free night certificates issued to members 
and the marketing services performed by the Group. Total fees are 
allocated to the performance obligations based on their estimated 
stand-alone selling prices. Revenue allocated to marketing and 
licensing obligations is recognised on a monthly basis as the 
obligations are satisfied. Revenue relating to points and free night 
certificates is recognised when the member has consumed the 
points or certificates at a participating hotel or has selected a reward 
from a third party, net of the cost of reimbursing the hotel or third 
party that is providing the benefit. 

Judgement is required in estimating the stand-alone selling prices 
which are based upon generally accepted valuation methodologies 
regarding the value of the licence provided and the number of points 
and certificates expected to be issued. However, the value of revenue 
recognised and the deferred revenue balance at the end of the year 
is not materially sensitive to changes in these assumptions.

Reimbursable revenues
In a managed property, the Group typically acts as employer of the 
general manager and, in some cases, other employees at the hotel 
and is entitled to reimbursement of these costs. The performance 
obligation is satisfied over time as the employees perform their 
duties, consistent with when reimbursement is received. 
Reimbursements for these services are shown as revenue with an 
equal matching employee cost, with no profit impact. Certain other 
costs relating to both managed and franchised hotels are also 
contractually reimbursable to IHG and, where IHG is deemed to 
be acting as principal in the provision of the related services, the 
revenue and cost are shown on a gross basis.

Segmental information
The Group has four reportable segments reflecting its geographical 
regions (Americas, EMEAA, Greater China) and its Central functions.

Under its franchise and management agreements, IHG receives 
assessment fees based on total qualifying hotel revenue from IHG 
One Rewards members’ hotel stays.

Central functions include technology, sales and marketing, 
finance, human resources, corporate services and insurance results. 
Central revenue arises principally from technology fee income.

The Group’s performance obligation is not satisfied in full until the 
member has consumed the relevant benefits. Accordingly, loyalty 
assessments are allocated between points and Milestone Rewards 
and deferred in an amount that reflects the stand-alone selling price 
of the future benefit to the member. Revenue is impacted by a 
‘breakage’ estimate of the benefits that will never be consumed. 
On an annual basis, the Group engages an external actuary who 
uses statistical formulae to assist in formulating this estimate, which 
is adjusted to reflect actual experience up to the reporting date.

As materially all of the awards will be either consumed at IHG 
managed or franchised hotels owned by third parties, or exchanged 
for awards provided by third parties, IHG is deemed to be acting as 
agent on consumption and therefore recognises the related revenue 
net of the cost of reimbursing the hotel or third party that is 
providing the benefit. 

Performance obligations under the Group’s co-brand credit card 
agreements comprise:

a)  Arranging for the provision of future benefits to members who 

have earned points or free night certificates;

b)  Marketing services; and

c)  Providing the co-brand partner with the right to access the 

loyalty programme.

No operating segments are aggregated to form these 
reportable segments. 

Management monitors the operating results of these reportable 
segments for the purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Each of the geographical 
regions is led by its own Chief Executive Officer or Managing 
Director who reports to the Group Chief Executive Officer.

The System Fund is not managed to generate a profit or loss for IHG 
over the longer term and cost reimbursements do not impact in-year 
profit or loss. System Fund and reimbursable revenues and results 
are therefore not regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (‘CODM’) and do not constitute an operating segment under 
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. 

Segmental performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss 
and is measured consistently with operating profit or loss in the Group 
Financial Statements, excluding System Fund, reimbursables and 
exceptional items. Group financing activities, fair value gains or losses 
on contingent purchase consideration and income taxes are managed 
on a Group basis and are not allocated to reportable segments.

Government grants
The Group receives government support income relating to the 
Group’s corporate office presence in certain countries and, as a 
result of Covid-19, has received support at certain of the Group’s 
leased hotels. 

Earnings per share 
Basic earnings or loss per ordinary share is calculated by dividing 
the profit or loss for the year available for IHG equity holders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares, excluding investment 
in own shares, in issue during the year.

Where grants are intended to compensate payroll costs they are 
recognised as an offset within staff costs; those which are unrelated 
to specific costs are presented within other operating income. 
As grants are recognised only where there is reasonable assurance 
that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be 
complied with, the grants may be recognised in subsequent years.

Diluted earnings or loss per ordinary share is calculated by adjusting 
basic earnings or loss per ordinary share to reflect the notional 
exercise of the weighted average number of dilutive ordinary share 
awards outstanding during the year. Where the effect of the notional 
exercise of outstanding ordinary share awards is anti-dilutive, these 
are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.

Receiving support at leased hotels may result in additional variable 
rent; these amounts are not offset in the Group income statement.

Financial income and expenses
Financial income and expenses include income and charges 
on the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and related hedging 
instruments, and foreign exchange gains and losses primarily related 
to the Group’s internal funding structure.

Finance charges relating to bank and other borrowings, including 
transaction costs and any discount or premium on issue, are 
recognised in the Group income statement using the effective 
interest rate method.

Borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition or development of 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare 
for their intended use are capitalised as part of the asset cost. 

In the Group statement of cash flows, interest paid and received is 
presented within cash from operating activities, including any fees 
and discounts on issuance or settlement of borrowings. Capitalised 
interest paid is presented within investing activities.

Exceptional items
The Group discloses certain financial information both including 
and excluding exceptional items. The presentation of information 
excluding exceptional items allows a better understanding of the 
underlying trading performance and trends of the Group and its 
reportable segments. It also provides consistency with the Group’s 
internal management reporting.

In determining whether an event or transaction is exceptional, 
quantitative and qualitative factors are considered. Exceptional 
items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, with 
consideration given to consistency of treatment with prior years and 
between gains and losses.

The tax effect of exceptional items is also presented as exceptional. 

Examples of exceptional items include, but are not restricted to, gains 
and losses on the disposal of assets, impairment charges and reversals, 
the costs of individually significant legal cases or commercial 
disputes and reorganisation costs. All exceptional items are subject 
to review by the Audit Committee.

Business combinations and goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed are measured at their fair value. Contingent 
liabilities assumed are measured at fair value unless this cannot 
be measured reliably, in which case they are not recognised but 
are disclosed in the same manner as other contingent liabilities. 

The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising on 
acquisition is as described in the general principles detailed within 
the ‘Taxes’ accounting policy note on page 170 with the exception 
that no deferred tax is provided on taxable temporary differences 
in connection with the initial recognition of goodwill.

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
fair value of the consideration transferred. Contingent purchase 
consideration is measured at fair value on the date of acquisition and 
is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair 
value recognised on the face of the Group income statement below 
operating profit. Deferred purchase consideration is subsequently 
measured at amortised cost and the effect of unwinding the discount 
is recorded in financial expenses. 

Payments of contingent and deferred purchase consideration 
reduce the respective liabilities. In respect of contingent purchase 
consideration, the portion of each payment relating to its original 
estimate of fair value on acquisition is reported within cash flow 
from investing activities in the Group statement of cash flows and 
the portion of each payment relating to the increase or decrease 
in the liability since the acquisition date is reported within cash 
flow from operating activities. In respect of deferred purchase 
consideration, the cash paid in excess of the initial fair value is 
reported within interest paid, and the remainder is reported within 
cash flows from investing activities.

Goodwill is recorded at cost, being the difference between the fair 
value of the consideration and the fair value of net assets acquired. 
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses and is not amortised.

Transaction costs are expensed and are not included in the cost 
of acquisition.

Intangible assets
Brands
Externally acquired brands are initially recorded at cost if separately 
acquired or fair value if acquired as part of a business combination, 
provided the brands are controlled through contractual or other 
legal rights, or are separable from the rest of the business. 
Brands are tested for impairment at least annually if determined 
to have indefinite lives.

Leases
The Group as lessee
On inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether it contains 
a lease. A contract contains a lease when it conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration. The right to use the asset and the obligation under 
the lease to make payments are recognised in the Group statement 
of financial position as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.

The costs of developing internally generated brands are expensed 
as incurred.

Management agreements
Management agreements acquired as part of a business combination 
are initially recognised at the fair value attributed to those contracts 
on acquisition and are subsequently amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the agreements, including any extension 
periods at the Group’s option.

Software
Substantially all software is internally generated; amounts capitalised 
include internal and third-party labour and consultancy costs. 

Internally generated development costs are capitalised when all 
of the following can be demonstrated:

•  The ability and intention to complete the project;

•  That the completed software will generate probable future 

economic benefits;

•  The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources 

to complete the project; and

•  The ability to measure the expenditure. 

Following initial recognition, the asset is carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Costs are 
generally amortised over estimated useful lives of three to five years 
on a straight-line basis with the exception of the Guest Reservation 
System which is amortised over seven to 10 years (see page 188).

Costs incurred in the research phase are expensed. In addition, 
configuration and customisation costs relating to cloud computing 
arrangements are expensed.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation 
and any accumulated impairment.

Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Land is not depreciated. All other property, plant and equipment 
are depreciated to a residual value over their estimated useful 
lives, namely:

•  Buildings – over a maximum of 50 years; and

•  Fixtures, fittings and equipment – three to 25 years.

All depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis. Residual value 
is reassessed annually.

Where the Group holds land or other property which it intends 
to occupy and provide hotel services, either as owner or manager, 
it is classified as property, plant and equipment.

Lease contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. 
The Group allocates payments in the contract to the lease and 
non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices 
and applies the lease accounting model only to lease components. 

The right-of-use asset recognised at lease commencement includes 
the amount of lease liability recognised, initial direct costs incurred 
and lease payments made at or before the commencement date, 
less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are 
depreciated to a residual value over the shorter of the asset’s 
estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are also 
adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities and are subject 
to impairment testing. Residual value is reassessed annually.

A lease liability is recorded when the leased asset is available for 
use by the Group and is initially measured at the present value of 
the lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease 
payments include fixed payments (including ‘in-substance fixed’ 
payments) and variable lease payments that depend on an index or 
a rate (initially measured using the index or rate at commencement), 
less any lease incentives receivable. ‘In-substance fixed’ payments 
are payments that may, in form, contain variability but that, in 
substance, are unavoidable. In calculating the present value of lease 
payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease 
is not readily determinable.

The lease term includes periods subject to extension options which 
the Group is reasonably certain to exercise and excludes the effect 
of early termination options where the Group is reasonably certain 
that it will not exercise the option. Minimum lease payments include 
the cost of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain it will 
purchase the underlying asset after the lease term.

After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is 
increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for lease 
payments made. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured 
if there is a modification, a change in the lease term or a change in 
lease payments as a result of a rent review or change in the relevant 
index or rate.

Variable lease payments are payable under certain of the Group’s 
hotel leases and arise where the Group is committed to making 
lease payments that are contingent on the performance of these 
hotels. Such lease payments that do not depend on an index or 
a rate are recognised as an expense in the period over which the 
event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

The Group has opted not to apply the lease accounting model to 
intangible assets, leases of low-value assets or leases which have 
a term of less than 12 months. Costs associated with these leases 
are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.

Payments and receipts are presented as follows in the Group 
statement of cash flows:

•  Short-term lease payments, payments for leases of low-value 

assets and variable lease payments that are not included in the 
measurement of the lease liabilities are presented within cash 
flows from operating activities;

•  Payments for the interest element of recognised lease liabilities are 
included in interest paid within cash flows from operating activities; 
and

•  Payments for the principal element of recognised lease liabilities 

are presented within cash flows from financing activities.

The Group as lessor
Leases, including subleases, for which the Group is a lessor are 
classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to 
the lessee, the lease is classified as a finance lease. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases. Where a leased property earns 
rentals under an operating sublease outside of the normal course 
of business, the Group’s interest in the lease is classified as an 
investment property within right-of-use assets; these are subsequently 
measured under the cost model.

When the lease is classified as an operating lease, rental income 
arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis in the Group 
income statement. 

When the lease is classified as a finance lease, the Group’s interest 
in the lease is derecognised and is replaced by a finance lease 
receivable. Any difference between those amounts is recognised 
in the Group income statement. Finance lease receivables are 
presented within other receivables and are initially measured at the 
present value of lease payments receivable under the sublease plus 
any initial direct costs. Finance lease interest is recognised within 
financial income in the Group income statement.

Receipts are presented as follows in the Group statement of 
cash flows:

•  Receipts from operating leases and investment properties are 

presented within cash flows from operating activities; and

•  Receipts from finance leases are presented within cash flows 

from investing activities.

Associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is not 
control or joint control over those policies. A joint venture exists 
when two or more parties have joint control over, and rights to the 
net assets of, the venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed 
sharing of control which only exists when decisions about the 
relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties 
sharing control.

In determining the extent of power or significant influence, 
consideration is given to other agreements between the Group, 
the investee entity, and the investing partners. This includes any 
related management or franchise agreements and the existence 
of any performance guarantees. 

Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method unless the associate or joint venture is classified as held for 
sale. Under the equity method, the Group’s investment is recorded 
at cost adjusted by the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits and 
losses, and other movements in the investee’s reserves, applying 
consistent accounting policies. When the Group’s share of losses 
exceeds its interest in an associate or joint venture, the Group’s 
carrying amount is reduced to $nil and recognition of further losses 
is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of 
an associate or joint venture.

If there is objective evidence that an associate or joint venture is 
impaired, an impairment charge is recognised if the carrying amount 
of the investment exceeds its recoverable amount.

Upon loss of significant influence over an associate or joint control 
of a joint venture, any retained investment is measured at fair value 
with any difference to carrying value recognised in the Group 
income statement.

Impairment of non-financial assets
Non-financial assets are tested for impairment when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable and, in the case of goodwill and brands with 
indefinite lives, at least annually. 

Assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are allocated 
to the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’), or group of CGUs, to which they 
belong. For impairment testing of hotel properties, each hotel is 
deemed to be a CGU.

If carrying values exceed their estimated recoverable amount, 
the assets or CGUs are written down to the recoverable amount. 
Recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. Value in use is assessed based on estimated future 
cash flows, including the effect of inflation, discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax nominal discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset.

With the exception of goodwill, an assessment is made at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have 
decreased. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
only if there has been a significant change in the assumptions used 
to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment 
loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, 
net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in prior years. 

Impairment losses, and any subsequent reversals, are recognised 
in the Group income statement.

Financial assets
On initial recognition, the Group classifies its financial assets as 
being subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit 
or loss (‘FVTPL’). 

Financial assets which are held to collect contractual cash flows 
and give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and 
interest are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Interest on 
these assets is calculated using the effective interest rate method 
and is recognised in the Group income statement as financial 
income. The Group recognises a provision for expected credit losses 
for financial assets held at amortised cost. With the exception of 
trade receivables, where there has not been a significant increase 
in credit risk since initial recognition, provision is made for defaults 
that are possible within the next 12 months. Where there has been 
a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, for 
example trade deposits and loans where the borrower is in financial 
difficulty or has not met repayments as they fall due, provision is 
made for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the asset.

The Group has elected to irrevocably designate equity investments 
as FVOCI as they mainly comprise strategic investments in entities 
that own hotels which the Group manages. Changes in their value 
are recognised within gains or losses on equity instruments 
classified as FVOCI in the Group statement of comprehensive 
income and are never recycled to the Group income statement. 
On disposal, any related balance within the fair value reserve is 
reclassified to retained earnings. Dividends from equity investments 
classified as FVOCI are recognised in the Group income statement 
as other operating income when the dividend has been declared, 
when receipt of the funds is probable and when the dividend is not 
a return of invested capital. Equity instruments classified as FVOCI 
are not subject to an impairment assessment. 

Financial assets not meeting the above criteria are measured at 
FVTPL. These include money market funds, investments which do 
not meet the definition of equity and other financial assets, including 
those which do not have a fixed date of repayment.

Trade receivables
A trade receivable is recorded when the Group has an unconditional 
right to receive payment. In respect of franchise fees, base and 
incentive management fees, Central revenue and revenues from 
owned, leased and managed lease hotels, the invoice is typically 
issued as the related performance obligations are satisfied, as 
described on page 163. Trade receivables typically do not bear 
interest and are generally on payment terms of up to 30 days. 

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost. A provision for impairment is made for 
lifetime expected credit losses. The Group has established a provision 
matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience by region 
and number of days past due. Where the historical experience is not 
relevant to defined owner groups, for example those in financial 
distress, lifetime expected credit losses are calculated by reference 
to other sources of data.

Trade receivables are written off once determined to be uncollectable. 

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term deposits, money 
market funds and repurchase agreements that are readily convertible 
to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. They generally have an original maturity of three 
months or less.

Cash and cash equivalents may include amounts which are subject 
to regulatory or other contractual restrictions and are not available 
for general use by the Group. 

Cash balances are classified as other financial assets when the Group 
is not able to freely access the funds because they are subject to a 
specific charge or other restrictions.

Money market funds
Money market funds are held at FVTPL, with distributions recognised 
in financial income.

Bank and other borrowings
Bank and other borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value 
of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction 
costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 

Borrowings are classified as non-current when the repayment date 
is more than 12 months from the period-end date or where they are 
drawn on a facility with more than 12 months to expiry.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised and subsequently measured at 
fair value. The subsequent accounting treatment depends on whether 
the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the 
nature of the item being hedged.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives which have either not been 
designated as hedging instruments or relate to the ineffective portion 
of hedges are recognised immediately in the Group income statement.

Documentation outlining the measurement and effectiveness of 
any hedging arrangement is maintained throughout the life of the 
hedge relationship.

Interest arising from currency derivatives and interest rate swaps 
is recorded in either financial income or expenses over the term 
of the agreement, unless the accounting treatment for the hedging 
relationship requires the interest to be taken to reserves. 

Within the Group statement of cash flows, interest paid includes 
interest paid on the Group’s bonds and the related derivative 
financial instruments.

Cash flow hedges
Financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges when 
they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that are attributable 
to either a highly probable forecast transaction or a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability.

Changes in the fair value are recorded in other comprehensive 
income and cash flow hedge reserves to the extent that the hedges 
are effective. When the hedged item is recognised, the cumulative 
gains and losses on the related hedging instrument are reclassified 
to the Group income statement, within financial expenses.

Net investment hedges
Financial instruments are designated as net investment hedges 
when they hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. 

Changes in the fair value are recorded in other comprehensive 
income and the currency translation reserve to the extent that the 
hedges are effective. The cumulative gains and losses remain in 
equity until the relevant foreign operation is disposed, at which point 
they are reclassified to the Group income statement as part of the 
gain or loss on disposal.

Financial guarantee contracts
In limited cases, the Group may guarantee part of mortgage 
loans made to facilitate third-party ownership of hotels under IHG 
management or franchise arrangements. The Group has elected 
to apply the requirements of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ to these 
arrangements. Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognised 
at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the amount 
calculated under the Group’s expected credit loss model and any 
amount initially recognised less cumulative amounts recognised in 
accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy. The carrying 
value of financial guarantee liabilities is immaterial for all 
periods presented.

Fair value measurement
The Group measures each of the following at fair value 
on a recurring basis: 

•  Financial assets and liabilities measured at FVTPL; 

•  Financial assets measured at FVOCI; and 

•  Derivative financial instruments. 

Other assets are measured at fair value when impaired or 
re-measured on classification as held for sale by reference to fair 
value less costs of disposal.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants. Fair value is measured by reference to the principal 
market for the asset or liability assuming that market participants 
act in their economic best interests.

The fair value of a non-financial asset assumes the asset is used 
in its highest and best use, either through continuing ownership 
or by selling it.

The Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of 
relevant observable inputs using the following valuation hierarchy:

Level 1:   Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical 

assets or liabilities.

Level 2:  Other techniques for which all inputs which have a 

significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, 
either directly or indirectly.

Level 3:  Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect 
on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.

For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, 
the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

Further disclosures on the particular valuation techniques used 
by the Group are provided in note 25.

Where significant assets, such as property, are valued by reference 
to fair value less costs of disposal, an external valuation will normally 
be obtained using professional valuers who have appropriate market 
knowledge, reputation and independence.

Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount 
is reported in the Group statement of financial position if there is 
a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts 
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously. To meet these criteria, the 
right of set-off must not be contingent on a future event and must be 
legally enforceable in all of the following circumstances: the normal 
course of business; the event of default; and the event of insolvency 
or bankruptcy of the Group and all of the counterparties.

Taxes
Current tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior 
periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from, or paid to, the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of the reporting period. 

The calculation of the Group’s current tax charge involves 
consideration of applicable tax laws and regulations in many 
jurisdictions throughout the world. From time to time, the Group 
is subject to tax audits and uncertainties in these jurisdictions. 
The issues involved can be complex and audits may take a number 
of years to conclude. Where the interpretation of local tax law is not 
clear, management relies on judgement and accounting estimates 
to ensure all uncertain tax positions are adequately provided for 
in the Group Financial Statements, in accordance with IFRIC 23 
‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’, representing the Group’s 
view of the most likely outcome or, where multiple issues are 
considered likely to be settled together, the probability weighted 
amounts of the range of possible outcomes. 

This may involve consideration of some or all of the following factors:

•  strength of technical argument, impact of case law and clarity 

of legislation;

•  professional advice;

•  experience of interactions, and precedents set, with the particular 

taxing authority; and

•  agreements previously reached in other jurisdictions on 

comparable issues.

The Group has applied the exception to recognising and disclosing 
information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to 
Pillar Two income taxes.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise and are generally recognised 
in respect of temporary differences between the tax base and 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. 

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
in the periods in which the asset is released or the liability will be 
settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of the reporting period.

Judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax 
assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, should be recognised. 
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is 
regarded as probable that there will be sufficient and suitable 
taxable profits or deferred tax liabilities in the relevant legal entity 
or tax group against which such assets can be utilised in the future. 
For this purpose, forecasts of future profits are considered by 
assessing estimated future cash flows, consistent with those 
disclosed on page 161 within ‘Going concern’. Tax assumptions 
are overlaid to these profit forecasts to estimate the future 
taxable profits.

Deferred tax is not provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the 
timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Where deferred tax assets and liabilities arise in the same entity, or 
group of entities, and there would be a legal right to offset the assets 
and liabilities were they to reverse, the assets and liabilities are also 
offset in the Group statement of financial position.

Retirement benefits
Defined contribution plans
Payments to defined contribution plans are charged to the Group 
income statement as they fall due.

Defined benefit plans
Plan assets are measured at fair value and plan liabilities are 
measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit 
method, discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate 
of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent currency 
and term to the plan liabilities. The difference between the value 
of plan assets and liabilities at the period-end date is the amount 
of surplus or deficit recorded in the Group statement of financial 
position as an asset or liability. An asset is recognised when the 
employer has an unconditional right to use the surplus at some 
point during the life of the plan or on its wind-up.

The service cost of providing pension benefits to employees, 
together with the net interest expense or income for the year, 
is charged to the Group income statement within administrative 
expenses. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate 
to the net defined benefit asset or liability, after any asset restriction. 

Re-measurements comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return 
on plan assets and changes in the amount of any asset restrictions. 
Actuarial gains and losses may result from differences between 
the actuarial assumptions underlying the plan liabilities and actual 
experience during the year or changes in the actuarial assumptions 
used in the valuation of the plan liabilities. Re-measurement gains 
and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss 
in subsequent periods.

Actuarial valuations are carried out on a regular basis and are 
updated for material transactions and other material changes in 
circumstances (including changes in market prices and interest 
rates) up to the end of the reporting period.

Deferred compensation plan
The Group operates a deferred compensation plan in the US which 
allows certain employees to make additional provision for retirement 
through the deferral of salary with matching company contributions 
within a dedicated trust. The related assets and liabilities are 
recognised in the Group statement of financial position. The Group’s 
obligation to employees under the plan is limited to the fair value of 
assets held by the plan and so the assets and liabilities are valued at 
the same amount, with no net impact on profit or loss.

Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled share-based payment transactions with 
employees is measured by reference to fair value at the date at 
which the right to the shares is granted. Fair value is determined 
by an external valuer using option pricing models.

The cost of equity-settled share-based payment transactions is 
recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, 
over the period in which any performance or service conditions 
are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees 
become fully entitled to the award (vesting date).

The Group income statement charge represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognised at the beginning and end of that 
year. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance and/or service conditions 
are satisfied.

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that a payment will be made 
and a reliable estimate of the amount payable can be made. If the 
effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is 
discounted using a current pre-tax discount rate that reflects the 
risks specific to the liability. No amounts are currently discounted.

Commercial litigation and disputes
A provision is made when management consider it probable that 
payment may occur and the amount can be reliably estimated even 
though the defence of the related claim may still be ongoing through 
the court process.

Self insurance reserves
The Group holds insurance policies with third-party insurers 
against certain risks relating to its corporate operations and owned 
and leased properties. Certain risks are reinsured through the 
Group’s captive insurance company (the ‘Captive’), SCH Insurance 
Company. This reduces the cost of insurance to the Group.

For both the Group’s self insurance provisions and its external 
insurance obligations, in addition to the Captive obtaining regulatory 
approval, each line of insurance is subject to review and approval by 
the Insurance Executive Sub-Committee. The level of retained risk 
and expected loss is reviewed annually to balance the level of risk 
against external risk transfer costs. 

Insurance reserves are held principally in the Captive. They are 
established using independent actuarial assessments, which reflect 
current expectations of the future economic outlook, or are based 
on past claims experience provided by third parties.

Amounts utilised are principally paid to third-party insurers or 
dedicated claims handlers for subsequent settlement with the 
claimant. In order to protect the third-party insurer against the 
solvency risk of the Captive, the Group has outstanding letters 
of credit (see note 30).

Insurance
The Group has applied IFRS 17 for the first time in 2023. IFRS 17 
introduces a new measurement and disclosure model for insurance 
contract arrangements. The Group has applied these changes 
retrospectively.

The Group’s insurance reserves relating to managed hotels 
(previously included within provisions) are now included in the 
Group statement of financial position as insurance liabilities. 
Insurance liabilities include both claims which are incurred but 
not reported (‘IBNR’) and those reported but not yet settled. 
Reserves are established using IFRS 17’s premium allocation 
approach, as all policies have a duration of 12 months or less, 
and incorporate independent actuarial assessments which reflect 
current expectations of the future economic outlook and past 
claims experience.

The Group assesses other arrangements with guarantees and 
similar features to determine whether an insurance contract exists. 
No material contracts have been identified to date.

Insurance revenue and insurance expenses are presented separately 
within the Group income statement. Insurance revenue comprises 
reinsurance premiums which are recognised over the period of 
coverage; insurance expenses comprise the cost of claims and 
associated expenses. The effect of discounting is immaterial.

Disposal of non-current assets
The Group recognises sales proceeds and any related gain or loss on 
disposal on completion of the sales process. In determining whether 
the gain or loss should be recorded, the Group considers whether it:

•  has a continuing managerial involvement to the degree associated 

with asset ownership;

•  has transferred the significant risks and rewards associated with 

asset ownership; and

•  can reliably measure and will actually receive the proceeds.

Equity share capital and reserves
Equity share capital
Equity share capital includes the total net proceeds (both nominal 
value and share premium) on issue of the Company’s equity share 
capital. Share premium represents the amount of proceeds received 
for shares in excess of their nominal value.

Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve maintains the nominal value of the 
equity share capital of the Company when shares are repurchased 
and cancelled.

Shares held by employee share trusts
Shares held by employee share trusts comprise ordinary shares 
held by employee share trusts.

Other reserves
Other reserves comprise the merger and revaluation reserves 
previously recognised under UK GAAP, together with the reserve 
arising as a consequence of the Group’s capital reorganisation in 
June 2005. The revaluation reserve relates to the previous revaluations 
of property, plant and equipment which were included at deemed 
cost on adoption of IFRS. Following the change in presentational 
currency to US dollars in 2008, this reserve also includes exchange 
differences arising on retranslation to period-end exchange rates of 
equity share capital, the capital redemption reserve and shares held 
by employee share trusts.

Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve comprises movements in the value of financial 
assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. 

Cash flow hedge reserves
The cash flow hedge reserves comprise:

•  Cash flow hedge reserve: the effective portion of the cumulative 
net change in the fair value of hedging instruments used in cash 
flow hedges pending subsequent recognition in profit or loss; and

•  Cost of hedging reserve: the gain or loss which is excluded from 

the designated hedging instrument relating to the foreign currency 
basis spread of currency swaps. 

Currency translation reserve 
The currency translation reserve comprises the movement in 
exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations 
and exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings and 
derivative financial instruments that provide an effective hedge 
against net investments in foreign operations. On adoption of IFRS, 
cumulative exchange differences were deemed to be $nil.

Non-controlling interest
A non-controlling interest is equity in a subsidiary of the Group not 
attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Group.

Climate change
There are no climate-related estimates and assumptions that have 
a material impact on asset values in the Group Financial Statements. 
In particular, the following have been considered:

•  In the case of goodwill and brands, the carrying value is recovered 

in less than 5 years under the Base Case forecasts and is not 
susceptible to medium-term risks.

•  In the case of the InterContinental Boston, for which the lease 
expires in 2105, the last impairment test performed indicates 
headroom above recoverable value of approximately 25% of the 
asset value before the asset would be impaired.

•  In the case of other hotel assets (within property, plant and 

equipment, right-of-use assets, associates or other financial assets) 
the remaining economic lives, whether they are sensitive to the 
impact of transitional risks or are susceptible to physical risks.

•  In the case of contract assets, the term of the management 

agreement and the significant headroom of fee income over the 
asset carrying value.

•  The period of coverage of performance guarantees and owner 
loan guarantees, together with caps on the Group’s exposure.

The comparative information in these Consolidated Financial 
Statements has been re-presented for the adoption of IFRS 17, 
as summarised below.

•  The Group’s insurance reserves relating to managed hotels 

(previously included within provisions) are now included in the 
Group statement of financial position as insurance liabilities. 
As at 31 December 2022, current insurance liabilities of $9m and 
non-current insurance liabilities of $23m have been reclassified. 

•  Insurance revenue (previously presented within revenue from fee 
business) and insurance expenses (previously presented within 
administrative expenses) are now presented separately within the 
Group income statement. For the year ended 31 December 2022, 
these amounts totalled $15m and $11m (2021: $9m and $8m) 
respectively.

Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ in relation to International 
Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules
The amendments to IAS 12 have been introduced in response to 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s 
(‘OECD’) base erosion and profit shifting (‘BEPS’) Pillar Two rules 
and include: 

•  In the case of the recoverability of the UK deferred tax asset, the 
impact of the potential downside risk on the Group’s forecasts 
(see disclosure on page 185).

•  a mandatory temporary exception to the recognition and 
disclosure of deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional 
implementation of the Pillar Two model rules; and 

Additionally, increasing operating costs over a medium term, for 
example energy, are not expected to have a material impact on any 
of the Group’s assets.

•  disclosure requirements to help users of the financial statements 

better understand the Group’s exposure to Pillar Two income taxes 
arising from that legislation, particularly before its effective date. 

While there is currently no material medium-term impact expected 
from climate change, the risks attached to climate change continue 
to evolve and these will continue to be assessed against the Group’s 
judgements and estimates.

The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 12 from 1 January 
2023 with there being no impact to the Group’s reported financial 
performance or position. The incremental disclosure required by 
the amendment is provided in note 8.

New accounting standards and other presentational changes
Adoption of new accounting standards
IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’
IFRS 17, which replaces IFRS 4, introduces a new measurement and 
disclosure model for insurance contracts issued. IFRS 17 applies to 
all types of insurance contracts, regardless of the type of entities 
that issue them. 

The Group has adopted IFRS 17 using the full retrospective method 
of adoption with the date of initial application being 1 January 2023. 
On adoption of IFRS 17, the Group elected to apply the requirements 
of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ to financial guarantee contracts 
which were previously accounted for by applying IFRS 4. 
The carrying value of financial guarantee liabilities is immaterial 
for all periods presented.

The Group’s contracts within the scope of IFRS 17 for the periods 
presented include IHG’s global insurance programme which 
provides coverage to managed hotels for certain risks. Premiums are 
payable by the hotels to third-party insurance providers. Some of the 
risk is reinsured by the Captive, in exchange for premiums paid from 
the third-party insurance provider to the Captive. 

The adoption of IFRS 17 had no impact on operating profit, profit 
before or after tax, net liabilities or cash flows for any period 
presented. As a result, the Group has not included a third statement 
of financial position at 31 December 2021 within the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

Other standards adopted
The Group has applied the following amendments:

•  IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Disclosure of Accounting 

Policies;

•  IAS 8 – Definition of Accounting Estimates; and 

•  IAS 12 – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from 

a Single Transaction.

None of these amendments have had a material impact on the 
Group’s reported financial performance or position.

New standards issued but not yet effective
From 1 January 2024, the Group will apply the amendments to:

•  IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current;

•  IAS 1 – Non-current Liabilities with Covenants; 

•  IFRS 16 – Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback; and

•  IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – Supplier Finance Arrangements.

From 1 January 2025, the Group will apply the amendments to:

•  IAS 21 – Lack of Exchangeability

There is no anticipated material impact from these amendments on 
the Group’s reported financial performance or position.

Other presentational changes
Revenues and expenses from the System Fund are presented 
together with reimbursable revenue and expenses in the Group 
income statement for clarity of presentation, consistency with 
industry practice and to reflect the fact that neither of these are 
reported to the CODM and do not generate a profit or loss for the 
Group over the longer term. Analysis of these items continues to 
be provided in note 3 and note 32.

and $16m government support income relating to the EMEAA region. The net impact of government support income on operating profit 
from reportable segments was $6m after deducting additional variable rent of $10m which became payable as a direct result of the 
support received.

Group Financial Statements

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued

6. Exceptional items continued
(a) Costs of ceasing operations in Russia
On 27 June 2022, the Group announced it was in the process of ceasing all operations in Russia consistent with evolving UK, US and EU 
sanction regimes and the ongoing and increasing challenges of operating there. The costs associated with the cessation of corporate 
operations in Moscow and long-term management and franchise contracts were presented as exceptional due to the nature of the war 
in Ukraine which drove the Group’s response.

(b) Commercial litigation and disputes
From time to time, the Group is subject to legal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of each is always subject to many uncertainties inherent 
in litigation. The 2022 provision for commercial litigation and disputes principally related to the EMEAA region and was utilised in full in 2023 
following settlement of the disputed matters.

In 2021, related to the agreed costs to settle two commercial disputes, $18m in the Americas region and $7m in the EMEAA region.

These costs were presented as exceptional reflecting the quantum of the costs and nature of the disputes.

(c) Share of profits/losses of associate
As part of an agreed settlement of the 2021 Americas commercial dispute in relation to the Barclay associate, in 2022 the Group was allocated 
expenses in excess of its actual percentage share which directly reduced the Group’s current interest in the associate. This resulted in $60m 
of additional expenses being allocated to the Group in 2022, with a current tax benefit of $15m and, applying equity accounting to this 
additional share of expenses, reduced the Group’s investment to $nil. In addition, a liability of $18m was recognised, reflecting an unavoidable 
obligation to repay this amount in certain circumstances. The value of the liability is linked to the value of the hotel; increases in the property 
value are attributed first to the Group and are reflected as a reduction of the liability until it is reduced to $nil. 

In 2023, the increase in fair value of the hotel (according to pricing opinions provided by a professional external valuer) resulted in a full 
reversal of the liability but no further trigger for reversal of previous impairment charges. 

The gain is presented as exceptional by reason of its size, the nature of the agreement and for consistency with the associated charges 
in 2022 and 2021.

(d) Other operating income
Relates to amounts receivable from the Group’s insurer under its business interruption policy for certain owned, leased and managed lease 
hotels due to Covid-19.

The income is presented as exceptional due to its size.

(e) Impairment charge/reversals on contract assets
In 2022, the $5m charge related to key money pertaining to managed and franchised hotels in Russia. The $3m reversal related to other 
impairments originally recorded in 2020 and arises as a result of the improved financial position of owners or performance of the 
related hotels.

These costs are presented as exceptional for consistency with (a) above and, in respect of releases, with the treatment applied in prior years.

(f) Tax on exceptional items
The tax impacts of the exceptional items are shown in the table below:

a  In 2022, related to the release of tax contingencies no longer needed; one of these was as a result of the closure of a tax audit of the 2014 US federal income tax return. In 2021, 

the tax charge related to the same audit.

(g) Exceptional tax
Related to the enactment of a change to the UK rate of corporate income tax from 19% to 25%, effective 1 April 2023. The change resulted in 
the re-measurement of those UK deferred tax assets and liabilities which are forecast to be utilised or crystallise after this effective date, using 
the higher tax rate. A further credit of $4m was recorded within the Group statement of comprehensive income in respect of movements in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities originally recorded there. The value attributable to unrecognised deferred tax assets increased by $34m 
as a result of the rate change; this had no impact on the reported tax charge.

Financial income comprises $24m (2022: $12m, 2021: $8m) relating to financial assets held at amortised cost and $15m (2022: $10m, 2021: $nil) 
relating to financial assets held at FVTPL. 

Interest expense on external borrowings and unwind of discount on deferred purchase consideration relate to financial liabilities which are 
held at amortised cost. Other charges includes bank charges and non-bank interest expense.

In 2023, $43m (2022: $15m, 2021: $1m) was payable to the System Fund in relation to interest accumulated on the balance of cash received 
in advance of the consumption of points awarded through the IHG One Rewards loyalty programme. The expense and corresponding System 
Fund interest income are eliminated within financial expenses. On a net basis, financial income and expenses includes $1m (2022: $1m, 
2021: $2m) of other interest which is also attributable to the System Fund.

a  The System Fund is, in general, not subject to taxation. 

b  Includes (0.6) percentage points (2022: (1.0) percentage points, 2021: (0.7) percentage points) in respect of the US Foreign-derived intangible income regime.

c  Includes 1.3 percentage points (2022: 6.9 percentage points, 2021: 7.1 percentage points) driven by the relatively high blended US rate, which includes US Federal and State taxes.

d  In 2021, the UK Government enacted an increase to the UK rate of Corporation Tax from 19% to 25%. 

e  During 2023, law implementing a new corporate income tax regime was substantively enacted in the UAE. This resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of $9m in the UAE. 

Absent further law change, this benefit is not likely to reoccur.

f  Predominantly in respect of losses arising in the year. 

g  Entirely in respect of adjustments relating to estimated recoverable deferred tax assets other than 2023. In 2023, includes 0.7 percentage points respectively relating to the provision 

of previously unprovided deferred tax liabilities which arise on temporary differences in subsidiaries.

h  Relates to the finalisation of tax returns, activity from tax authorities such as tax audits and the reassessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions.

Factors that may affect the future tax charge
Many factors will affect the Group’s future tax rate, the main ones being future legislative developments, future profitability of underlying 
subsidiaries and tax uncertainties. 

In 2021, the OECD made proposals for worldwide tax reform under a two ‘pillar’ system – Pillar One and Pillar Two. Pillar One has not been 
enacted in any jurisdiction, but even if it were in its current form, the Group would not expect to be impacted. 

Pillar Two seeks to impose a global minimum tax, essentially establishing a floor on corporate tax competition by ensuring a large 
multinational enterprise is subject to tax in each jurisdiction at a 15% effective minimum tax rate regardless of where it operates. A total 
of 145 jurisdictions have agreed in principle to implement the Pillar Two rules with approximately a third of these actively preparing and 
implementing legislation. Notably the UK, the Group’s headquarter jurisdiction, substantively enacted the Pillar Two rules in 2023 and as 
such they will apply to the Group on a worldwide basis from 1 January 2024, with the first tax return due to be filed by 30 June 2026. 

For the first three years of operation, transitional exemptions operate on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis to remove the need to prepare 
full calculations. The Group has analysed these exemptions on the assumption that the Pillar Two rules were to have applied in the periods 
2019 to 2022 and concluded that only three jurisdictions in the Group would have failed to meet the exemptions once transactions or items 
that the Group would not expect to recur in the future were excluded. Failing to meet the exemptions does not mean that Pillar Two tax will 
be due, but instead that the full calculations are performed, which are complex in nature. The profit before tax for these three territories in 
2023 was c.$35m and accordingly the Group does not believe any material Pillar Two tax would have arisen.

Once the transitional exemptions cease to be available at the start of 2027, the Group will be required to perform full calculations for every 
jurisdiction. The Group will continue to assess the future impact of the rules, taking into account the issuance of new guidance and refinements 
to the rules (including possible new exemptions), expected to occur within the next three years. However, given that a significant proportion 
of the Group’s profit before tax was earned in legal entities in the US, UK and China, each of which has a blended future statutory tax rate of 
25% or higher, the Group considers the likelihood of material future Pillar Two taxes arising to be low, based upon the current profile of the 
Group’s business. 

As a revenue protecting measure, more jurisdictions are beginning to implement their own minimum tax systems, in general, with rules 
similar to those of Pillar Two. This has the impact of replacing any Pillar Two tax arising on the profits of a jurisdiction with an equivalent 
amount of domestic tax.

8. Tax continued
Tax paid
Total tax paid (net of refunds) is entirely in respect of operating activities. This comprises taxes paid directly by Group entities to taxing 
authorities and taxes withheld at source in respect of fees payable to the Group. Taxes withheld at source are paid by hotel owners to their 
local taxing authorities on behalf of the Group. The table below shows the territories to whom taxes are directly paid by the Group which 
exceed $5m in the current or comparative periods, in addition to the UK, the Group’s headquarter jurisdiction. The year-on-year increases 
are predominantly driven by corresponding increases to Group profitability and refunds received in 2021 in respect of earlier periods.

A deferred tax asset of $nil (2022: $107m) has been recognised in legal entities which have made a loss in the current or the previous year.

Recoverability of UK deferred tax assets
The Group has recognised UK deferred tax assets of $113m (2022: $109m), including revenue losses of $73m (2022: $73m). The deferred 
tax assets have been recognised following the consideration of both positive and negative evidence in respect of the probability of future 
taxable profits against which the assets could be recovered. The losses have arisen by identifiable non-recurring events, for example special 
contributions into a former Group pension scheme and the impact of Covid-19, absent which, the UK tax group would have been profitable. 
The losses do not expire, although they can only be offset against 50% of annual UK taxable profits. The UK deferred tax asset should reverse 
over a seven- to ten-year period (2022: seven- to ten-year period), with the lower end of this range based on the Group’s Base Case forecast 
(see page 161 within ‘Going concern’) and the upper end of the range based on the Group’s Severe Downside Case forecast.

8. Tax continued
The Group’s TCFD disclosures describe how physical and transitional climate risks present both risks and opportunities for IHG. The potential 
downside risk has been considered in the context of the UK deferred tax asset recoverability, without taking account of opportunities or 
mitigating actions, and could be absorbed within the sensitivities disclosed above.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets
The Group does not recognise deferred tax assets if it cannot anticipate being able to offset them against existing deferred tax liabilities 
or against future profits or gains.

Unprovided deferred tax liabilities
No deferred tax liability has been provided in respect of $0.5bn (2022: $0.5bn) of taxable temporary differences relating to subsidiaries 
(comprising undistributed earnings and net inherent gains).

Uncertain tax positions
Current tax payable includes $14m (2022: $9m) in respect of uncertain tax positions, with the largest single item not exceeding $3m 
(2022: $3m). There are no amounts recognised in relation to uncertain tax positions within deferred tax in either the current or prior year.

The Group’s most material territories for tax are the US and the UK and the Group carries provisions of $6m (2022: $3m) in respect 
of US federal and state tax uncertainties and $nil (2022: $nil) in respect of UK Corporation Tax uncertainties.

In the US, the Internal Revenue Service has the right to commence a routine audit of a federal income tax return for up to three years 
following the filing of the return. The Group has now agreed all federal tax returns up to and including 2019 and there are no ongoing audits.

In the UK, HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) has the right to commence a routine audit of a UK Corporation Tax return for up to 12 months 
following the filing of the return. The Group has agreed all UK tax returns for periods up to 2021 other than 2016. The Group received a 
single question from HMRC in respect of the 2016 period in 2019, to which a response was provided also in 2019. The Group has received 
no meaningful update since and still considers the risk of material adjustment to be low.

Goodwill and brands
Brands
Brands relate to the acquisitions of Kimpton ($193m), Regent ($57m) and Six Senses ($189m). They are each considered to have an 
indefinite life given their strong brand awareness and reputation, and management’s commitment to continued investment in their growth. 
The brands are protected by trademarks and there are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful 
lives of the brands. In the hotel industry there are a number of brands that have existed for many years and IHG has brands that are over 
60 years old.

12. Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, have been determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions are 
RevPAR growth (detailed on page 161 within ‘Going concern’), terminal growth rates and pre-tax discount rates. Cash flows beyond the 
five-year period are extrapolated using terminal growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets. 
Cash flow projections are discounted using pre-tax rates that are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and incorporate 
adjustments reflecting risks specific to the territory of the CGU.

The weighted average terminal growth rates and pre-tax discount rates are as follows:

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, exceeded their carrying value such that no impairment has arisen. Assumptions 
were sensitised, including using the Severe Downside Case scenario (detailed on page 161 within ‘Going concern’), with no impairment 
arising reflecting the number of years of Base Case forecasts required to recover the carrying value.

Software
Software includes $146m relating to the development of the next-generation Guest Reservation System with Amadeus. Internally developed 
software with a net book value of $105m is being amortised over seven to ten years, with five years remaining at 31 December 2023, reflecting 
the Group’s experience of the long life of guest reservation systems and the initial term over which the Group is party to a technology 
agreement with Amadeus. The remaining project value relates to enhancements to existing systems as part of the project, which are 
amortised over five years.

In 2023 and 2022, no impairment was charged. 

Management agreements
Management agreements relate to contracts recognised at fair value on acquisition. The weighted average remaining amortisation period 
for all management agreements is 14 years (2022: 15 years).

2022 impairment reversal
The impairment reversal of $12m related to the Kimpton management agreement portfolio in the Americas region and arose due to strong 
trading conditions in 2022 and significantly improved industry forecasts. The key assumption was RevPAR growth which was approximately 
in line with the Group forecast detailed in the 2022 Annual Report. Cash flows beyond the five-year period were extrapolated using a 1.8% 
long-term growth rate that did not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant market.

The portfolio was valued at value in use (which exceeded fair value less costs of disposal) using discounted cash flow techniques that measure 
the present value of projected post-tax income flows. The post-tax discount rate used was 10.8%; the pre-tax equivalent rate is 14.8%.

Impairment and impairment reversals
2022 impairment
An impairment charge of $10m was recognised in the year on property, plant and equipment relating to one hotel in the EMEAA region. 
A further $2m impairment of right-of-use assets was recognised in relation to the same hotel. The charge arose, and was classed as 
exceptional, due to recent cost inflation which is impacting operating costs but also the projected variable rent payments. The assets 
were measured at value in use, using a discounted cash flow approach based on the hotel’s five-year plan. Cash flows beyond the five-year 
period were extrapolated using a long-term growth rate which did not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the relevant country. 
Estimated future cash flows were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 9.6%. The recoverable amount was $nil.

13. Property, plant and equipment continued
2022 impairment reversal
Impairment reversals of $3m were recognised in relation to the UK portfolio (EMEAA region) and arose as a result of the renegotiation 
of contractual agreements which enhanced the cash-generating potential of those hotels. The recoverable amount was measured at value 
in use, using a discounted cash flow forecast used to assess the new deal with rentals based on the agreed contractual terms. A pre-tax 
discount rate of 14.2% was applied.

In both 2022 impairment tests, hotel specific plans were used which used the IHG UK RevPAR forecasts adjusted for factors specific to the 
individual property (such as revenue from food and beverage facilities and the impact of renovations on occupancy and rate).

14. Leases continued
The Group’s leased assets mainly comprise hotels and offices. Leases contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The term of 
property leases ranges from 1-99 years. The weighted average lease term remaining on the Group’s top eight leases (which comprise 94% 
(2022: 95%) of the right-of-use asset net book value) is 56 years (2022: 56 years). The InterContinental Boston lease, expiring in 2105, has 
a significant impact on this weighted average lease term; excluding this lease the weighted average lease term is 8 years (2022: 9 years). 
Undiscounted cash flows on the Boston lease of $3,212m (2022: $3,233m) represent 94% (2022: 94%) of the total undiscounted cash flows 
relating to lease liabilities.

Many of the Group’s property leases contain extension or early termination options, which are used for operational flexibility. The lease 
agreement over the US corporate headquarters contains a material extension option which is not included in the calculation of the lease 
asset and liability as the extension would not take effect before 2031 and there is no reasonable certainty the option will be exercised. 
The value of the undiscounted rental payments relating to this lease and not included in the value of the lease asset and liability is $295m. 
Additionally, the Group has the option to extend the term of the InterContinental Boston lease for two additional 20-year terms, the first 
of which would take effect from 2105. These extension options have not been included in the calculation of the lease liability.

Impairment and impairment reversals
2022 impairment
Details of the $2m impairment charge are contained in note 13.

2022 impairment reversal
Impairment reversals of $2m were recognised in relation to one hotel in the EMEAA region and arose due to improved recovery forecasts 
as well as strong 2022 trading. The asset was measured at value in use, using a discounted cash flow for the remaining five-year lease term. 
Estimated future cash flows were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 17.6%. The recoverable amount was $9m which represents the depreciated 
value of the original asset. 

2021 impairment reversal
Impairment reversals of $3m were recognised in relation to the US corporate headquarters and arose as a result of contractual agreements 
to sublease or surrender certain areas for the remainder of the lease term, removing uncertainty over future cash flows for those areas.

The recoverable amount was measured at value in use, using a discounted cash flow based on the agreed contractual terms. A pre-tax 
discount rate of 9.5% was applied. 

The impairment reversal was substantially all recognised in the System Fund in line with existing principles for cost allocation relating 
to this facility.

Lease liabilities
The majority of the Group’s lease liabilities are discounted at incremental borrowing rates of up to 11%. The rate implicit in the 
InterContinental Boston lease was 9.7% and was derived from a valuation of the hotel at lease inception in 2006.

14. Leases continued
Variable lease payments
The UK portfolio leases contain guarantees that the Group will fund any shortfalls in lease payments up to an annual and cumulative cap. 
These caps limit the Group’s exposure to trading losses, meaning that rental payments are reduced if insufficient cash flows are generated 
by the hotels. Since there is no floor to the rent reduction applicable under these leases, they are treated as fully variable. In the event that 
rent reductions are not applicable, annual base rental payments stabilise at £34m over the remaining lease term of 20 years. Additional 
performance-based rental payments are calculated using hotel revenues and net cash flows.

In addition, one German hotel lease under a similar structure is treated as fully variable. One further German hotel lease under a similar 
structure is expected to commence in 2024.

liability recognised in 2022 and its subsequent reversal (see note 6). In 2022, $42m was included within exceptional items in addition to the $18m above.

Barclay associate
The Group held one associate investment which had a significant impact on profit for the current and prior year, a 19.9% interest in 
111 East 48th Street Holdings, LLC (the ‘Barclay associate’) which owns InterContinental New York Barclay, a hotel managed by the Group. 
The investment is classified as an associate and equity accounted. While the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence through 
certain decision rights, approval rights relating to the hotel’s operating and capital budgets rest solely with the 80.1% majority member. 
The Group’s ability to receive cash dividends is dependent on the hotel generating sufficient income to satisfy specified owner returns. 
$18m was provided in 2021 in relation to settlement of a commercial dispute regarding owner returns during the pandemic.

In 2022, impairment reversal of $2m related to an associate in the Americas region and arose due to strong trading conditions in 2022 and 
significantly improved industry forecasts. The recoverable amount was measured at fair value less costs of disposal, using a discounted 
cash flow approach that measures the present value of projected income flows (over a 10-year period) and the property sale. The key 
assumptions were RevPAR growth (which was in line with the Group forecast detailed in the 2022 Annual Report), discount rate of 9.75% 
and terminal capitalisation rate of 7.25%.

16. Other financial assets continued
Restricted funds 
Amounts ring-fenced to satisfy insurance claims are principally held in the Group’s Captive, which is a regulated entity.

The bank accounts pledged as security are subject to a charge in favour of the members of the UK unfunded pension arrangement (see 
note 27). The amounts pledged as security were reduced in the year with the trustees’ agreement, based on updated actuarial valuations. 
The bank accounts will continue to be pledged as security until the date at which the UK unfunded pension liabilities have been fully 
discharged, unless otherwise agreed with the trustees and amounts pledged may change in future years.

Expected credit losses 
Other financial assets with a net value of $68m (2022: $50m) are subject to the expected credit loss model requirements of IFRS 9. 
Equity securities, money market funds and other amounts measured at fair value are excluded. The gross value of trade deposits and loans 
that were subject to the expected credit loss requirements is $40m with credit loss allowances of $9m (2022: $20m gross, $12m allowance). 
Other expected credit losses are considered to be immaterial.

Credit risk
Restricted funds are held with bank counterparties which are rated at least A+ based on S&P’s ratings. 

The maximum exposure to credit risk of other financial assets at the end of the reporting period by geographic region is as follows:

The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit 
terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables, excluding 
prepayments, at the end of the reporting period by geographic region is as follows:

Americas

EMEAA

Cash at bank and in hand includes bank balances of $51m (2022: $86m) which are matched by bank overdrafts of $44m (2022: $55m) under 
the Group’s cash pooling arrangements. Under these arrangements, each pool contains a number of bank accounts with the same financial 
institution and the Group pays interest on net overdraft balances within each pool. The cash pools are used for day-to-day cash management 
purposes and are managed as closely as possible to a zero balance on a net basis for each pool. Overseas subsidiaries are typically in a 
cash-positive position with the matching overdrafts held by the Group’s central treasury company in the UK. Accordingly, bank overdrafts 
are included within cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.

Third-party bank loan guarantees
At 31 December 2023, the Group has issued financial guarantee contracts of up to $50m (2022: $50m). The carrying amount of these 
guarantees was $nil in all periods presented. The largest guarantee has a gross guaranteed amount of $21m (2022: $21m) and the underlying 
loan matures in 2029. Should the Group fund any amount under the guarantee, there is a cross-indemnity that the Group would seek to 
pursue for the other parties’ share.

Commercial litigation and disputes
The utilisation of the provision principally reflects the settlement of commercial litigation and disputes in the Americas and EMEAA regions 
which were fully provided for in the prior year. 

Self insurance reserves
Self insurance reserves consist of $12m of incurred but not reported (‘IBNR’) reserves and $2m of claims reported but not yet settled. 
$10m of these amounts relates to employment-related obligations. The utilisation of IBNR reserves is dependent on the timing of claims 
being reported and ultimately being settled; based on historical experience this is expected to be approximately five years. The maximum 
liabilities of the last five policy years is $49m, noting that actual claims did not significantly differ to estimates in 2023 or 2022.

24. Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments
Overview
The Group is exposed to financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business activities. These risks include: market risk, liquidity risk, 
credit risk and capital risk. There are Board approved policies in place to manage these risks. Treasury activities to manage these risks may 
include money market funds, repurchase agreements, spot and forward foreign exchange instruments, currency swaps, interest rate swaps 
and forward rate agreements.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. 
Market risk comprises: foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and other 
borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, debt and equity investments and derivatives. 

Foreign exchange risk
Movements in foreign exchange rates can affect the Group’s reported profit or loss, net liabilities and its interest cover. The most significant 
exposures of the Group are in currencies that are freely convertible. The Group’s reported debt has an exposure to borrowings held in sterling 
and euros. After the effect of currency swaps, the Group holds its bond debt in sterling, which is the primary currency of shareholder returns, 
and in US dollars, the predominant currency of the Group’s revenue and cash flows. US dollar borrowing or currency derivatives may also 
act as a net investment hedge of US dollar denominated assets.

When the Group borrows in currencies different from the functional currency of the borrowing entity, currency swaps are transacted at the 
same time to minimise foreign exchange risk. Currency swaps were transacted against the €500m 2.125% 2027 and €500m 1.625% 2024 
bonds, in November 2018 and October 2020 respectively, swapping the bonds’ proceeds and interest flows into sterling. Similar currency 
swaps were transacted against the €600m 4.375% 2029 bonds in November 2023, swapping the bond proceeds and interest flows into 
US dollars (see page 200).

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Group’s policy requires a minimum of 50% 
fixed rate debt over the next 12 months. With the exception of overdrafts, 100% of borrowings were fixed rate debt at 31 December 2023 
(2022: 100%).

Cash flow hedges
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the critical terms are aligned, such that the 
hedge ratio is 1:1.

The change in the fair value of hedging instruments used to measure hedge ineffectiveness in the period mirrors that of the hypothetical 
derivative (hedged item) and was $14m loss (2022: $48m gain).

Hedge ineffectiveness arises where the cumulative change in the fair value of the swaps exceeds the change in fair value of the future 
cash flows of the bonds, and may be due to any opening fair value of the hedging instrument, or a change in the credit risk of the Group 
or counterparty. There was no cumulative ineffectiveness in 2023 or 2022.

Amounts recognised in the cash flow hedge reserves are analysed in note 29.

Net investment hedges
The Group designates the following as net investment hedges of its foreign operations, being the net assets of certain Group subsidiaries 
with a US dollar functional currency:

•  Borrowings under the RCF;

•  Long-dated currency forward contracts; and

•  Certain short-dated foreign exchange swaps.

There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the net investment creates a foreign exchange 
risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the US dollar borrowings or foreign exchange swaps or forwards. The hedge ratio is 1:1 
as the underlying risk of the hedging instrument is identical to the hedged risk component. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing 
changes in the carrying amount of the hedging instrument that is attributable to a change in the spot rate with changes in the investment 
in the foreign operation due to movements in the spot rate. 

The change in value of hedging instruments recognised in the currency translation reserve through other comprehensive income was a gain 
of $15m (2022: $6m loss). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the Group income statement during the current or prior year.

Interest rate sensitivity relates to cash balances and would only be realised to the extent deposit rates increase by 1%.

Interest rate sensitivities include the impact of hedging and are calculated based on the year-end net debt position.

Liquidity risk
Group policy ensures sufficient liquidity is maintained to meet all foreseeable medium-term cash requirements and provide headroom 
against unforeseen obligations.

Cash and cash equivalents are held in short-term deposits, repurchase agreements and cash funds which allow daily withdrawals of cash. 
Most of the Group’s funds are held in the UK or US, although $30m (2022: $24m) is held in countries where repatriation is restricted 
(see note 18).

Medium- and long-term borrowing requirements are met through committed bank facilities and bonds as detailed in note 22.

The RCF contains two financial covenants: interest cover (Covenant EBITDA: Covenant interest payable) and a leverage ratio (Covenant net 
debt: Covenant EBITDA). These are tested at half year and full year on a trailing 12-month basis.

24. Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued
Credit risk
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is minimised by operating a policy on the investment of surplus cash that generally restricts 
counterparties to those with a BBB- credit rating or better or those providing adequate security. The Group uses long-term credit ratings 
from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch Ratings as a basis for setting its counterparty limits.

In order to manage the Group’s credit risk exposure, the treasury function sets counterparty exposure limits using metrics including credit 
ratings, the relative placing of credit default swap pricings, tier 1 capital and share price volatility of the relevant counterparty.

Repurchase agreements are fully collateralised investments, with a maturity of three months or less. The Group accepts only government 
or supranational bonds where the lowest credit rating is AA- or better as collateral. In the event of default, ownership of these securities 
would revert to the Group. The securities held as collateral are to protect against default by the counterparty.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with the maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount 
of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments. The expected credit loss on cash and cash equivalents is considered 
to be immaterial.

The table below analyses the Group’s short-term deposits, money market funds and repurchase agreement collateral classified as cash and 
cash equivalents by counterparty credit rating:

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. The capital structure consists of net debt, issued 
share capital and reserves. The structure is managed with the objective of maintaining an investment grade credit rating, to provide ongoing 
returns to shareholders and to service debt obligations, while maintaining maximum operational flexibility. A key characteristic of IHG’s 
managed and franchised business model is that it is highly cash generative, with a high return on capital employed. Surplus cash is either 
reinvested in the business, used to repay debt or returned to shareholders. 

The Group’s debt is monitored on the basis of a cash flow leverage ratio, being net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA. The Group has a stated 
aim of maintaining this ratio at 2.5x to 3.0x. The ratio at 31 December 2023 (which differs from the ratio as calculated for covenant tests) was 
2.09 (2022: 2.07). 

The Group currently has a senior unsecured long-term credit rating of BBB from S&P and obtained, in 2023, a Baa2 rating from Moody’s. 
In the event of either rating being downgraded below BBB- and Baa3 respectively (a downgrade of two levels) there would be an additional 
step-up coupon of 1.25% payable on the bonds which are subject to those ratings.

Right of offset
Other than in relation to cash pooling arrangements (see note 18), there are no financial instruments with a significant fair value subject 
to enforceable master netting arrangements and other similar agreements that are not offset in the Group statement of financial position. 

Valuation techniques
Money market funds, deferred compensation plan investments and bonds
The fair value of money market funds, deferred compensation plan investments and bonds is based on their quoted market price.

Unquoted equity securities
Unquoted equity securities are fair valued using a discounted cash flow model, either internally or using professional external valuers. 
The significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of the equity securities are RevPAR growth (based on the market-
specific growth assumptions used by external valuers), pre-tax discount rate which ranged from 6.4% to 10.0% (2022: 6.3% to 10.0%), 
and a non-marketability factor which ranged from 20.0% to 30.0% (2022: 20.0% to 30.0%).

There is no material sensitivity arising from changes in assumptions.

25. Classification and measurement of financial instruments continued
Derivative financial instruments and other payables
Currency swaps and currency forwards are measured at the present value of future cash flows discounted back based on quoted forward 
exchange rates and the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. Adjustments for credit risk use observable credit default 
swap spreads.

The put option over part of the Group’s investment in the Barclay associate was valued at $nil at 31 December 2023 and 2022. The value 
is equal to the excess of the amount receivable under the option (which is based on the Group’s capital invested to date) over fair value 
and is also affected by specially allocated expenses which resulted in an obligation of $18m in 2022 which reversed in 2023 (see note 6). 
The fair value of the hotel was derived from a pricing opinion provided by a professional external valuer which is categorised as a Level 3 
fair value measurement. The fair value of the hotel could fall by $38m before a liability arises.

Deferred purchase consideration
Deferred purchase consideration arose in respect of the acquisition of Regent, and comprises $13m payable in 2024. The first instalment 
of $13m was paid in 2021. 

Contingent purchase consideration
Regent $69m (2022: $65m)
In 2018, the Group acquired a 51% controlling interest in Regent Hospitality Worldwide, Inc (‘RHW’), with put and call options existing over 
the remaining 49% shareholding exercisable in a phased manner from 2026 to 2033. The Group has a present ownership interest in the 
remaining shares and the acquisition was accounted for as 100% owned with no non-controlling interest recognised and contingent 
purchase consideration comprising the present value of the expected amounts payable on exercise of the options based on the annual 
trailing revenue of RHW in the year preceding exercise with a floor applied.

The value of the contingent purchase consideration is subject to periodic reassessment as interest rates and RHW revenue expectations 
change. At 31 December 2023, it is assumed that $39m will be paid in 2026 to acquire an additional 25% of RHW with the remaining 24% 
acquired in 2028 for $42m. This assumes that the options will be exercised at the earliest permissible date which is consistent with the 
assumption made on acquisition. The amount recognised is the discounted value of the total expected amount payable of $81m. 
The discount rate applied is based on observable US corporate bond rates of similar term to the expected payment dates. The range 
of possible outcomes remains unchanged from the date of acquisition at $81m to $261m (undiscounted). 

The significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration are the projected trailing 
revenues of RHW and the date of exercising the options. If the annual trailing revenue of RHW were to exceed the floor by 10%, the amount 
of the contingent purchase consideration recognised in the Group Financial Statements would increase by $7m (2022: $6m). If the date 
for exercising the options is assumed to be 2033, the amount of the undiscounted contingent purchase consideration would be $86m 
(2022: $86m).

27. Retirement benefits
UK
Since 2014, UK retirement and death in service benefits are provided for eligible employees by the IHG UK Defined Contribution Pension Plan. 
Members are provided with defined contribution arrangements under this plan; benefits are based on each individual member’s personal 
account. The plan is HM Revenue & Customs registered and governed by an independent trustee, assisted by professional advisers as and 
when required. The overall operation of the plan is subject to the oversight of The Pensions Regulator.

The former defined benefit plan, the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan, was wound up in 2015 following the completion of the buy-out 
and transfer of the defined benefit obligations to Rothesay Life.

Residual defined benefit obligations remain in respect of additional benefits provided to members of an unfunded pension arrangement 
(‘UK plan’) who were affected by lifetime or annual allowances under the former defined benefit arrangements. Accrual under this 
arrangement ceased with effect from 1 July 2013 and a cash-out offer in 2014 resulted in the extinguishment of approximately 70% of the 
unfunded pension obligations. The Group meets the benefit payment obligations of the remaining members as they fall due. A charge over 
certain ring-fenced bank accounts totalling $32m (£25m) at 31 December 2023 (see note 16) is currently held as security on behalf of the 
remaining members.

US
During 2018, the Group completed a termination of the US funded Inter-Continental Hotels Pension Plan, which involved certain qualifying 
members receiving lump-sum cash-out payments with the remaining pension obligations subject to a buy-out by Banner Life Insurance 
Company, a subsidiary of Legal & General America.

The Group continues to maintain the unfunded Inter-Continental Hotels Non-qualified Pension Plans (‘US plans’) and unfunded Inter-Continental 
Hotels Corporation Postretirement Medical, Dental, Vision and Death Benefit Plan (‘US post-retirement plan’), both of which are defined 
benefit plans. Both plans are closed to new members. A Retirement Committee, comprising senior Group employees and assisted by 
professional advisers as and when required, has responsibility for oversight of the plans.

Mortality is the most significant demographic assumption. The current assumptions for the UK are based on the S3PA ‘light’ year of birth 
tables with projected mortality improvements using the CMI_2022 model and a 1.25% per annum long-term trend and a smoothing parameter 
(‘s-kappa’) of 7.0 with weightings of 92% and 86% for pensioners and 87% and 86% for non-pensioners, male and female respectively. In the 
US, the current assumptions use rates from the Pri-2012 Mortality Study and Generationally Projected with Scale MP-2021 mortality tables.

The assumptions applied to the UK plan and US plans for life expectancy at retirement age are as follows:

Sensitivities
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have an impact on the Group income statement 
and the Group statement of financial position. The key assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation, the assumed mortality rate 
and the healthcare costs trend rate. The sensitivity analysis below relates to the increase/(decrease) in the benefit obligation and is based 
on extrapolating reasonable changes in these assumptions, using year-end conditions and assuming no interdependency between

Philippines
The Group maintains a further, immaterial, pension plan for employees in the Philippines which is accounted for as a defined benefit plan.

At 31 December 2023, the net retirement benefit asset was $3m (2022: $2m) comprising plan assets of $12m (2022: $9m) and a defined 
benefit obligation of $9m (2022: $7m). Plan assets comprise $7m (2022: $6m) domestic government securities, $3m (2022: $2m) domestic 
equity investments, $1m (2022: $1m) money market funds and $1m (2022: $nil) domestic corporate bonds.

Contributions in the year were $2m (2022: $1m); the charge to System Fund and reimbursables was $1m (2022: $1m) and all other 
movements were less than $1m (2022: less than $1m).

Key assumptions used in the valuation are the discount rate of 6.0% (2022: 7.0%) and the rate of salary increases of 6.0% (2022: 6.0%). 
The weighted average duration of liabilities is 11 years (2022: 11 years); estimated future benefit payments are less than $1m in all years.

Defined contribution plans
The Group also operates a number of smaller pension plans outside the UK, the most significant of which is a defined contribution plan 
in the US.

28. Share‑based payments
In 2023, the new Deferred Award Plan rules (‘DAP’) replaced the IHG Annual Performance Plan (‘APP’) and Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
as a simplified, combined set of plan rules which govern the Company’s discretionary incentive plans. 

Awards granted under the DAP can consist of Deferred Annual Incentive (‘DAI’), Long-Term Incentive (‘LTI’), Restricted Stock Unit (‘RSU’) 
and other ad hoc awards.

The DAP rules were approved at the AGM on 5 May 2023, with all LTI and RSU awards granted after this date and DAI awards granted in 
respect of 2024 and future APP years being subject to the rules of the DAP. All previously granted awards will still be subject to the LTIP 
and APP rules respectively. In the transition to the DAP, there have been no changes to accounting for the awards.

Annual Performance/Deferred Annual Incentive Awards
Eligible employees (including Executive Directors) may receive all or part of their bonus in the form of deferred shares and/or receive 
one-off awards of shares. Deferred shares in relation to annual performance-related bonus plans are released on the third anniversary of the 
award date. Awards are conditional on the participants remaining in the employment of a participating company or leaving for a qualifying 
reason. The grant of deferred shares under the APP/DAP is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 

The number of shares is calculated by dividing a specific percentage of the participant’s annual performance-related bonus award by the 
average of the middle market quoted prices on the three consecutive business days following the announcement of the Group’s results for 
the relevant financial year.

Long Term Incentive Plan and Restricted Stock Units
Executive Directors and eligible employees may receive conditional share awards, which normally have a vesting period of three years, 
subject to continued employment. In addition, certain LTI awards made to Executive Directors are normally subject to a further two-year 
holding period after vesting.

LTI awards are subject to performance-based vesting conditions set by the Remuneration Committee, which are normally measured over 
the vesting period.

Awards are normally made annually and, except in exceptional circumstances, will not exceed 3.5 or 5 times salary for eligible employees 
under the LTIP or DAP rules respectively.

Colleague Share Plan
The Colleague Share Plan gives eligible corporate employees the opportunity to purchase shares up to an annual limit. After the end of the 
plan year, the participant will be awarded the right to receive one matching share for every purchased share (subject to continued employment). 
If the participant holds the purchased shares until the second anniversary of the end of the plan year, the conditional right to matching 
shares vests.

The total fair value of the Colleague Share Plan is not significant.

   More detailed information on the performance measures for awards to Executive Directors is shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
on pages 128 to 133.

Under the authority given to the Company by shareholders at the AGM held on 6 May 2022 to purchase its own shares, in August 2022 the 
Board approved a $500m share buyback programme that commenced on 9 August 2022 and completed on 31 January 2023. In February 
2023 the Board approved a further $750m share buyback programme which completed on 29 December 2023. In the year ended 31 December 
2023, 10.9m shares were repurchased for total consideration of $790m including $28m transaction costs and subsequently cancelled. 
Of the total consideration, $38m relates to the completion of the 2022 programme and $752m relates to the 2023 programme. The cost of 
treasury shares and related transaction costs have been deducted from retained earnings. In the year ended 31 December 2022, 9.1m shares 
were repurchased for total consideration of $482m including $2m transaction costs, of which 4.5m were held as treasury shares and 4.6m 
were cancelled. 

When approving shareholder returns in 2022 and 2023, the Board first reviewed the Parent Company Financial Statements to confirm 
availability of sufficient distributable reserves.

In February 2024, the Board approved a further $800m share buyback programme. A resolution to renew the authority to repurchase shares 
will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 3 May 2024.

The Company no longer has an authorised share capital.

on the currency swaps and an exchange loss of $14m (2022: $57m gain, 2021: $81m loss) which offsets a corresponding gain or loss on the 
hedged bonds.

30. Contingencies and commitments
2022 criminal unauthorised access to technology systems
On 6 September 2022, the Group announced that parts of the Group’s technology systems had been subject to unauthorised activity causing 
disruption to IHG’s booking channels and other applications. No evidence of unauthorised access to systems storing guest data was 
identified and precautionary regulatory notifications were filed and have been closed.

A class action has been filed, although alleged damages have not been specified. Given the uncertainty around the timing of the legal process 
and the quantum of any damages, it is not practicable to make a reliable estimate of the possible financial effect of any claims on the Group 
at this time.

The Group holds third-party insurance policies in respect of cyber risks. It is expected that any further payment of claims will be recoverable 
under insurance policies, subject to specific agreement with the insurance providers. 

Litigation
From time to time, the Group is subject to legal proceedings the ultimate outcome of each being always subject to many uncertainties 
inherent in litigation. These legal claims and proceedings are in various stages and include disputes related to specific hotels where the 
potential materiality is not yet known; such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, have not in the recent past and are not likely 
to have a material effect on the Group’s financial position or profitability. Previously reported contingent liabilities have been resolved or are 
considered remote.

It is the view of the Directors that, other than to the extent that liabilities have been provided for in these Group Financial Statements (see 
note 20), it is not possible to quantify any loss to which these proceedings may give rise, however, as at the date of reporting, the Group 
does not believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material effect on the Group’s financial position.

Other items 
At 31 December 2023, the Group had outstanding letters of credit of $68m (2022: $55m) mainly relating to the Group’s Captive. The letters 
of credit do not have set expiry dates, but are reviewed and amended as required.

The Group had total commitments for capital expenditure of $10m at 31 December 2023 (2022: $6m). The Group has also committed to 
invest $3m (2022: $6m) in one of its associates.

Parent Company Financial Statements

Notes to the Parent Company 
Financial Statements

1. Accounting policies
General information
The Parent Company Financial Statements of InterContinental Hotels 
Group PLC (the ‘Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2023 
were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 19 February 
2024 and the Parent Company statement of financial position was 
signed on the Board’s behalf by Michael Glover. The Company is a 
public limited company incorporated and registered in England and 
Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are publicly traded on the 
London Stock Exchange and it is not under the control of any single 
shareholder. The Company’s primary activity is acting as a holding 
company for the Group’s investments.

The Parent Company Financial Statements are presented in sterling 
and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m) except 
when otherwise indicated.

No income statement is presented for the Company as permitted 
by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 

Going concern
The Directors have assessed, in the light of current and anticipated 
economic conditions, the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. Having considered the going concern status and liquidity 
of the Group (see page 161), the Directors confirm they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company has sufficient resources 
to continue operating until at least 30 June 2025 and there are no 
material uncertainties that may cast doubt on the Company’s going 
concern status. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Parent Company Financial Statements.

Basis of preparation
The Parent Company Financial Statements have been prepared 
in accordance with FRS 101, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. FRS 101 sets out a reduced 
disclosure framework for a ‘qualifying entity’ as defined in the 
standard which addresses the financial reporting requirements 
and disclosure exemptions in the individual financial statements 
of qualifying entities that otherwise apply the recognition, 
measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted IFRSs.

FRS 101 sets out amendments to adopted IFRSs that are necessary to 
achieve compliance with the Companies Act and related Regulations.

The following disclosures have not been provided as permitted 
by FRS 101:

•  A cash flow statement and related notes as required by IAS 7 

‘Statement of Cash Flows’;

•  A comparative period reconciliation for share capital as required 

by IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’;

•  Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned 

subsidiaries as required by IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’;

•  Disclosures in respect of capital management as required by 

paragraphs 134 to 136 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’; 

•  The following paragraphs of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial 

statements’ (removing the requirement to present):

 – 10(d) (statement of cash flows);

 – 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS); and

 – 111 (cash flow statement information).

•  The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs as required by 

paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes 
in Accounting Estimates and Errors’; and

•  Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management 

personnel as required by paragraph 17 of IAS 24 ‘Related 
Party Disclosures’.

Where the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company 
include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken 
the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the 
following disclosures:

•  The requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 

‘Share-based Payment’ in respect of group-settled share-based 
payments; and

•  The requirements of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value 

Measurement’ and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’.

The accounting policies set out herein have, unless otherwise 
stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
Financial Statements.

Critical accounting policies and the use of judgements, 
estimates and assumptions
There are no critical estimates or judgements which are considered 
to present significant risk of a material adjustment to the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in the next financial year.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised and subsequently measured at 
fair value. The subsequent accounting treatment depends on whether 
the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the 
nature of the item being hedged.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives which have either not been 
designated as hedging instruments or relate to the ineffective portion 
of hedges are recognised immediately in the income statement. 

Documentation outlining the measurement and effectiveness of 
any hedging arrangement is maintained throughout the life of the 
hedge relationship.

Interest arising from currency derivatives and interest rate swaps 
is recorded in either financial income or expenses over the term 
of the agreement, unless the accounting treatment for the hedging 
relationship requires the interest to be taken to reserves.

Capital and reserves
Accounting policies relating to capital and reserves, which are also 
applicable to the Company, can be found on page 171 of the Group 
Financial Statements.

The share premium account represents the amount of proceeds 
received for shares in excess of their nominal value.

Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled shared-based payment transactions with 
employees is measured by reference to fair value at the date at which 
the right to the shares is granted. Fair value is determined by an 
external valuer using option pricing models.

The cost of equity-settled share-based payment transactions is 
recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over 
the period in which any performance or service conditions are 
fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees 
become fully entitled to the award (vesting date).

Where the Company grants awards over its own shares to the 
employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase in the cost 
of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled 
share-based payment charge recognised in its Consolidated 
Financial Statements with the corresponding credit being 
recognised directly in equity. Any consideration received from 
subsidiaries in relation to those awards does not represent an 
increase in the cost of investment.

1. Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting policies
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company’s 
functional currency at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of 
the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated to the functional currency at 
the relevant rates of exchange ruling on the last day of the period. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised 
in the income statement. 

Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity 
securities, amounts due from and amounts due to Group undertakings 
and loans and other borrowings.

Investments in equity securities
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost plus deemed capital 
contributions arising from share-based payment transactions less 
any provision for impairment. The carrying amount is reviewed 
at each reporting date, including a comparison to the market 
capitalisation of the Company on 31 December 2023 (£11.7bn) to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement.

Amounts due from Group undertakings
Amounts due from Group undertakings are recognised initially 
at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method less provision for expected credit 
losses. Allowances for expected credit losses are made based 
on the risk of non-payment, taking into account ageing, previous 
experience, economic conditions and forward-looking data. 
Such allowances are measured as either 12-month expected credit 
losses or lifetime expected credit losses, depending on changes 
in the credit quality of the counterparty. 

Amounts due to Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair 
value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method.

Amounts due from and to Group undertakings are only offset where 
the relevant facilities permit such offset under all conditions described 
in the Group accounting policy for offsetting of financial assets and 
financial liabilities on page 169 of the Group Financial Statements.

Loans and other borrowings
Loans and other borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of 
the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. 
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Finance charges, 
including transaction costs and any discount or premium on issue, 
are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest 
rate method.

Borrowings are classified as due after more than one year when the 
repayment date is more than 12 months from the period-end date 
or where they are drawn on a facility with more than 12 months 
to expiry.

Under UK tax law it is possible to realise certain categories of deferred tax assets, including all those of the Company, against future taxable 
profits of any other UK entity within the Group. There is an expectation of sufficient future taxable profits within the Group which supports 
the recognition of the Company’s deferred tax asset.

   More detailed information on the basis for deferred tax recognition is shown within the Group accounting policies and note 8 to the Group Financial 
Statements on pages 170 and 184.

Revenue per available room (RevPAR), average daily rate and occupancy
RevPAR is the primary metric used by management to track hotel performance across regions and brands. RevPAR is also a commonly used 
performance measure in the hotel industry. RevPAR comprises IHG system rooms revenue divided by the number of room nights available 
and can be mathematically derived from occupancy rate multiplied by average daily rate (ADR). Occupancy rate is rooms occupied by hotel 
guests expressed as a percentage of rooms that are available. ADR is rooms revenue divided by the number of room nights sold.

References to RevPAR, occupancy and ADR are presented on a comparable basis comprising groupings of hotels that have traded in both 
the current and prior year. The principal exclusions in deriving this measure are new hotels, hotels closed for major refurbishment and hotels 
sold in either of the two years. RevPAR and ADR are quoted at a constant US$ conversion rate, in order to allow a better understanding of 
the comparable year-on-year trading performance excluding distortions created by fluctuations in exchange rates.

The following tables present RevPAR statistics for the year ended 31 December 2023 and a comparison to 2022. Fee business and owned, 
leased and managed lease statistics are for comparable hotels and include only those hotels in the Group’s System at 31 December 2023 
and franchised, managed, owned, leased or operated under a managed lease by the Group since 1 January 2022. The comparison with 
2022 is at constant US$ exchange rates.

7,006,782 shares held in treasury, which constituted 4.07% of the 
total issued share capital (including treasury shares). 

There are no special control rights or restrictions on share transfers 
or limitations on the holding of any class of shares.

During 2023, 500,000 shares were transferred from treasury to the 
employee share ownership trust.

As far as is known to management, IHG is not directly or indirectly 
owned or controlled by another company or by any government. 
The Board focuses on shareholder value creation. When it decides 
to return capital to shareholders, it considers all of its options, 
including share buybacks and special dividends.

Share issues and buybacks
In December 2023, we completed our $750m share buyback 
programme which was announced, and commenced, on 
21 February 2023. As part of the buyback, 10,643,334 shares were 
bought back and cancelled.

Further information on the transactions that took place this year can 
be found on page 260.

Directors’ Report continued

Employee engagement statement
Our statement relates to IHG’s directly employed individuals and 
should be read in conjunction with our people section, Section 172 
statement, Voice of the Employee and wider workforce remuneration 
and employee engagement disclosures on pages 29 to 31, 102 and 
103, 113, 117 and 118 and 123 and 124. 

During 2023, the main communication channels to provide 
information of concern to employees included weekly newsletters, 
virtual town halls, CEO and regional leadership calls, podcasts, blogs, 
email broadcasts, videos and business function team meetings.

Employees have been consulted and given opportunities to express 
their views and concerns through participation in the employee 
engagement survey, Voice of the Employee feedback sessions, 
ERGs, Next events (interactive sessions relating to IHG’s strategy and 
behaviours), quarterly performance, development and wellbeing 
meetings, team meetings and the Q&A session as part of the CEO 
quarterly business update call.

Each December, employees are invited to join the employee share 
plan. The plan is available to around 98% of our corporate employees 
below the senior/mid-management level (who received LTIP and 
restricted stock units awards). Further details are on page 123.

Employees have been made aware of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the performance of the Company through quarterly 
business update calls with the CEO, as well as business function 
team meetings and other regional leadership calls.

The Chair and other Directors have engaged with employees 
through a number of means, including direct interactions, Voice 
of the Employee feedback sessions, Next events and a series of 
opportunities held during the year to meet Executive Directors via 
video meetings or in person.

Details of how Directors have had regard to employee interests, and 
the effect of that regard, including principal decisions taken by IHG 
during the year can be found on pages 38 to 40 and 101 to 103.

Employee numbers 
Having a predominantly franchised and managed business model 
means that many of those people who work at hotels operated 
under our brands are not our employees. 

The average number of IHG employees, including part-time 
employees, during 2023 were as follows:

•  7,292 people worldwide (including those in our corporate offices, 

central reservations offices and owned, leased and managed 
leased hotels (excluding those in a category below)), whose costs 
were borne by the Group; and

•  20,306 people who either worked directly on behalf of the 

System Fund and whose costs were borne by the System Fund, 
or as General Managers and (in the US predominantly) other hotel 
workers, who work in managed hotels, who have contracts or are 
directly employed by IHG and whose costs are borne by those 
hotel owners.

 See note 4 of the Group Financial Statements on page 178.

Employment of disabled persons
IHG continues to focus on providing an inclusive environment, in 
which employees are valued for who they are and what they bring to 
the Group, and in which talented individuals are retained through all 
levels of the organisation. 

We look to appoint the most appropriate person for the job and are 
committed to providing equality of opportunity to all employees 
without discrimination. Every effort is made to ensure that 
applications for employment from disabled employees are fully 
and fairly considered and that disabled employees have equal 
opportunities to training, career development and promotion. 

 See our people disclosures on pages 29 to 31.

 Visit ihgplc.com/responsible-business for more information.

2023 share awards and grants to employees
Our current policy is to settle the majority of awards or grants under 
the Company’s share plans with shares purchased in the market or 
from shares held in treasury; however, the Company continues to 
review this policy. The Company’s share plans incorporate the 
current Investment Association’s guidelines on dilution which 
provide that commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury 
shares under executive plans should not exceed 5%, and under all 
plans should not exceed 10%, of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in any 
10-year period. During the financial year ended 31 December 2023, 
the Company transferred 500,000 treasury shares (0.29% of the 
total issued share capital) to satisfy obligations under its share plans.

The estimated maximum dilution from awards made under the 
Company’s share plans over the last 10 years is 4.49%.

As at 31 December 2023, there were no options outstanding. 
The Company has not utilised the authority given by shareholders 
at any of its AGMs to allot shares for cash without first offering such 
shares to existing shareholders.

Employee share ownership trust (ESOT)
IHG operates an ESOT for the benefit of employees and former 
employees. The ESOT receives treasury shares from the Company 
and purchases ordinary shares in the market and releases them 
to current and former employees in satisfaction of share awards. 
During 2023, the ESOT released 899,845 shares and at 31 December 
2023, it held 589,077 ordinary shares in the Company. The ESOT 
adopts a prudent approach to purchasing shares, using funds provided 
by the Group, based on expectations of future requirements.

Certain shares that have been allocated to share plan participants 
under the Annual Performance Plan (APP) are held in a nominee 
account on behalf of those participants by Computershare Investors 
Plc (Nominee). As at 31 December 2023, the Nominee held 225,688 
forfeitable shares as part of the APP. The shares held by the Nominee 
have been allocated to share plan participants on terms that entitle 
those participants to request or require the Nominee to exercise the 
voting rights relating to those shares. The Nominee exercises those 
votes in accordance with the directions of the participants. Shares 
that have not been allocated to share plan participants under such 
terms are held by the ESOT and although the trustee has the right to 
vote or abstain from exercising their voting rights in relation to those 
shares, it has a policy of not voting, which is in line with guidelines. 
The trustee also has the right to accept or reject any offer relating to 
the shares in any way it sees fit.

Unless otherwise requested by the Company, the trustee of the 
ESOT waives all ordinary dividends on the shares held in the ESOT, 
other than shares which have been allocated to participants on 
terms which entitle them to the benefit of dividends, except for such 
amount per share as shall, when multiplied by the number of shares 
held by it on the relevant date, equal one pence or less. 

In 2023, the new Deferred Award Plan (‘DAP’) rules were approved 
by shareholders at the May AGM. For more information, please see 
the Remuneration Report on page 127.

Colleague Share Plan 
The Company’s employee share plan, known as the Colleague Share 
Plan, was first introduced in 2019 following approval by shareholders 
at the Company’s 2019 AGM.

In accordance with the Colleague Share Plan Rules, participants’ 
contributions are used to purchase shares on a monthly basis on 
behalf of the individuals (Purchased Shares) and held within the 
Nominee. At the end of the Plan Year, the participants receive a 
conditional right to receive one share (Matching Share) for every 
one Purchased Share that they have purchased. Provided the 
participants hold the Purchased Shares in the Nominee until the 
second anniversary of the end of the Plan Year, the conditional right 
to Matching Shares will vest.

In 2023, 45 shares vested outside of the usual timetable due to 
deaths or good leavers, and in January 2024, 30,922 shares vested 
as part of the third Plan Year. As at 16 February 2024, the Nominee 
held 30,084 Purchased Shares in relation to the fourth Plan Year.

Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct (Code) applies to all Directors, officers and 
employees and complies with the NYSE rules as set out in Section 
406 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. Further details on our 
Code, including the Board's oversight of the Code, are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 39 and 40.

Business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
Our business relationships with our guests, hotel owners and 
suppliers are fundamental to our commercial success. During the 
year, the Board considered matters related to them and had regard 
to the impact of decisions on them as detailed in the key matters 
discussed by the Board on pages 101 to 103. These included 
strategic and operational matters relating to our brand portfolio, 
global sales strategy and operating regions.

The Board monitors relationships through a mixture of presentations, 
reports and direct engagement. The Responsible Business 
Committee specifically reviews responsible procurement processes, 
targets and the Supplier Code of Conduct.

Details of how relationships have been maintained during the year 
are set out in the key stakeholder engagement tables on pages 36 
and 37.

The Group is party to a technology agreement with Amadeus 
Hospitality Americas, Inc. (Amadeus), for the next generation central 
reservation system used by the Group. The initial term of 10 years 
will expire in 2028, and the Group has the right to extend this 
agreement for two additional periods of up to 10 years each on the 
same terms, conditions and pricing. The financial and performance 
obligations in this agreement are guaranteed by Amadeus IT Group 
S.A., the parent company of Amadeus.

Otherwise, there are no specific individual contracts or arrangements 
considered to be essential to the business of the Group as a whole.

Future business developments of the Group

  Details on these are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 21 to 27.

Finance
Political donations
The Group made no political donations under the Companies Act 
during the year and proposes to maintain this policy in respect of 
such donations. Notwithstanding this policy, in accordance with US law, 
one of IHG’s US subsidiaries provides administrative support to an 
employee-operated Political Action Committee in the US (US PAC), which 
is funded by voluntary political donations from eligible employees. 
The US PAC is not controlled by IHG. All decisions regarding the amounts 
and recipients of contributions are directed by the Board of Directors of 
the US PAC, in accordance with its Charter and By-laws. In 2023, a total 
of US $12,600 was expended on political contributions by the US PAC.

Financial risk management

  The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies, including 
its use of financial instruments, are set out in note 24 to the Group 
Financial Statements on pages 199 to 203. 

Significant agreements and change of control provisions

together with interest accrued.

•  The four-year €500 million bond issued by the Company on 
8 October 2020, under which, if the bond’s credit rating was 
downgraded in connection with a change of control, the bond 
holders would have the option to require the Company to redeem 
or, at the Company’s option, repurchase the outstanding notes 
together with interest accrued.

8 October 2020, under which, if the bond’s credit rating was 
downgraded in connection with a change of control, the bond 
holders would have the option to require the Company to redeem 
or, at the Company’s option, repurchase the outstanding notes 
together with interest accrued.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
By delivering more environmentally sustainable hotels, we create 
value for IHG, our hotel owners and all our stakeholders. We recognise 
the risks from climate change and the importance of reducing our 
carbon footprint and our 2030 Science Based Target (SBT) reflects 
this. Our SBT is approved by the SBTi and aligns with the most 
ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement to keep global warming 
within 1.5°C by targeting a reduction in market-based greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions of 46% across our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, 
as well as our Scope 3 GHG emissions covering both our Fuel and 

Energy Related Activities (FERA) and franchised hotels energy. 
Our Exclusive Partners hotels (i.e. Iberostar Beachfront Resorts) are 
not included within the scope of our ESG reporting and are therefore 
not included in our Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting 
(SECR) table at present.

  Refer to page 63 for more information on our SBT and Carbon KPI and 
pages 52 to 59 for more information on how we identify and manage 
climate-related risks and the steps we are taking to mitigate these, 
including our transition plan.

Our Performance 
Our absolute Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 market-based GHG emissions 
have decreased by 1.9% compared to our 2019 baseline level despite 
our system size growing from over 5,900 open hotels in 2019 to over 
6,300 in 2023 across 100 countries. In addition, we have seen a 
reduction of 3.8% in our GHG emissions intensity per occupied 
room night on the same basis.

Even as our actions become more widely embedded across our 
estate, the rate at which we can decarbonise will be impacted by 
several factors, including rates of grid decarbonisation and 
government’s climate change policies. We recognise that our role 
in collaborating with governments, peers and trade bodies will be 
crucial to supporting owners and the industry in decarbonising 
successfully. Some of the key external dependencies we have 
identified are outlined in our TCFD disclosure on page 58 and 
have been factored into our decarbonisation plan.

To support our progress towards our decarbonisation target while 
continuing to grow our business, we are taking action across three 
main areas: decarbonising our existing hotels; sourcing renewable 
energy; and developing new-build hotels that operate at very low/
zero carbon.

  See pages 56 and 57 for more information on our decarbonisation 
strategy and our transition plan.

  See pages 47 to 49 of our 2023 Responsible Business Report for 
a full breakdown of our GHG emissions and energy data including 
renewable energy.

GHG Scope boundaries
We report Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions in tonnes 
(tCO2e) as defined by the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard methodology, under the operational 
control approach: 

•  Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from the combustion 
of fuels on-site, in company-owned vehicles and from refrigerant 
losses from our managed, owned, leased and managed lease 
hotels and corporate offices. 

•  Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions generated by the 
energy purchased or acquired from our managed, owned, leased 
and managed lease hotels and corporate offices. A market-based 
method has been used to calculate total GHG emissions as this 
aligns with our SBT, however we have also reported Scope 2 
location-based emissions for reference in the table above. 

•  Scope 3 emissions are indirect GHG emissions that occur in IHG’s 
value chain. The Scope 3 emissions included within our SBT are 
material to IHG in accordance with the SBTi criteria. This includes 
Category 3 (FERA) from IHG’s managed, owned, leased and 
managed lease hotels and corporate offices, as well as Category 14 
(Franchises), which includes the Scope 1 and 2 market-based 
emissions of our franchised hotels energy consumption and their 
Scope 3 FERA. For the purposes of SECR, IHG also report Scope 3 
emissions from UK business travel in rental or employee-owned 
vehicles where IHG is responsible for purchasing the fuel, in the 
table above. However, these emissions are not in the scope of our 
SBT and, therefore, not included in the total figures above, reported 
in our Carbon KPI or our 2023 Responsible Business Report. 

  See page 47 of our 2023 Responsible Business Report for more 
information on our SBT and GHG emissions scopes and materiality.

Methodology
We work with data specialists to give us an up-to-date picture 
of IHG’s carbon footprint and assess our performance over time. 
To calculate our global energy consumption for the reporting period 
1 January to 30 September 2023, we used energy consumption 
data reported by hotels through IHG’s Green Engage system. 
Energy consumption for the final three months of 2023 has been 
estimated using an average consumption from the previous 12 months, 
applied to a projected number of occupied room nights to ensure 
that all hotels have a consumption figure corresponding to their 
likely occupancy. This approach was not used for fuel where it was 
not possible to determine whether data was missed or fuel was not 
used, or only purchased intermittently/ seasonally. Estimating Q4 
enables us to gain assurance over the data we report for the 
calendar year and aligns with our financial reporting period to 
enable analysis of both financial and non-financial indicators for 
the same period. Outlier checks were completed, and a gap-filling, 
and extrapolation methodology was applied where necessary. 
Any missing data points for energy consumption were filled using 
average consumption per room night from the nearest 12-month 
period. The IHG system size and number of occupied room nights 
used to estimate missing energy data is based on nine months of 
actual data and three months of data from 2022. Our estimation 
methodology is conservative to reduce the risk of under reporting. 
For 2023, the energy sample included 86% of hotels reporting 
energy consumption globally. As IHG’s system size is constantly 
changing and as new data becomes available, each year we restate 
the previous year’s figures (2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022). 

  For more information on our restatement method and historical GHG 
emissions and utility data, see pages 46 to 51 of our 2023 Responsible 
Business Report.

To calculate our emissions, we use the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard methodology. Energy (MWh) 
and fuel (Litres) use was converted to GHG emissions using the 
published conversion factors from sources including IEA, USEPA, 
AIB and BEIS, and reported to the nearest tonne in tCO2e across 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The most recently published emissions 
factors were used for all regions and applied to each energy data 
point to give associated GHG emissions. Intensities were calculated 
from the data in the sample group and divided by the total occupied 
room nights in the sample group. 

To ensure that our market-based emissions reporting is robust, 
IHG only reports on renewable electricity where we have received 
corresponding Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or energy 
contracts that state that the electricity being purchased is 100% 
renewable. This evidence is validated by our internal teams and 
third-party verification provider. We are working to improve this 
reporting and validation process to account for more of the 
renewable energy that is being procured by our hotels going forward.

  The full details of our methodology statements for GHG emissions and all 
utilities are detailed on pages 46 to 51 of our 2023 Responsible Business 
Report, where we report our carbon, energy (including renewables), water 
and waste data since 2019, as part of a performance tracking towards our 
Journey to Tomorrow commitments. 

  Our carbon, energy and water data has been verified by a third-party, 
the assurance statements can be found at ihgplc.com/

Energy reduction initiatives
We have devised a strategy to drive forward our carbon reduction 
commitments while expanding our estate. To make progress against 
our decarbonisation target while continuing to grow our business, 
we are taking action across three main areas: decarbonising our 
existing hotels; sourcing renewable energy; and developing new-build 
hotels that operate at very low/zero carbon. Due to the different 
challenges and opportunities across our three regions, we have 
developed regional plans to take into consideration the significant 
geographical and operational variances. These regional plans are 
overseen by a new regional governance structure that incorporates 
oversight of resource and capital planning requirements. These 
regional plans have helped us to accelerate action in 2023 and 
further support hotels where we can.

In 2022, we updated our brand standards to integrate ECMs; 
these include high-efficiency, low-flow aerated shower heads and 
taps and LED lighting. In 2023, we integrated further ECMs into 
our existing estate across the Essentials & Suites (E&S) brands in 
the Americas. These measures included guest room occupancy 
sensing thermostats to ensure that heating/ cooling isn’t being used 
unnecessarily in unoccupied rooms, public area and back-of-house 
programmable thermostats (upon renovation) to ensure heating 
and cooling operation is efficient, and switching traditional electric 
resistance packaged terminal air- conditioners with more efficient 
packaged terminal heat pumps upon replacement. All ECMs 
integrated into hotel brand standards are carefully considered in 
consultation with the Hotel Owners Association and supported by 
our LTIP ESG metrics. We are now working on implementing 
additional brand standards tailored to each region and segment. 

Every hotel is given access to the IHG Green Engage system, 
our comprehensive online environmental management platform, 
which helps hotel teams to measure, track and report their utility 
consumption and carbon footprint, as well as providing over 
200 ‘Green Solutions’ with detailed guidance to support hotels 
in reducing their energy, water and waste impacts. To comply with 
the IHG Green Engage standard, hotels are required to report their 
monthly energy consumption and complete key energy-saving 
actions. Collaborating with our hotels, we actively promote energy 
efficiency throughout our estate, assigning customised annual and 
2025 energy reduction targets to each hotel. To motivate hotels to 
reduce their energy consumption, these targets are integrated into 
hotel-level metrics and key performance indicators, aligning with the 
Executive Committee’s broader metrics, including Guest Satisfaction 
and Guest Love. We track their performance through the verifiable 
data required to enter into our IHG Green Engage system. 

IHG continues to invest in utility data acquisition to improve data 
quality and assurance to enhance our reporting. This includes our 
collaboration with an energy specialist to offer all our hotels a 
centralised data feed solution to collect utility information, which is 
then sent directly into the Green Engage system. The collected data 
enables improved analytics for hotels to drive efficiencies in utility 
management and strengthen hotel RFP responses to corporate 
clients globally.

Being part of IHG means hotel owners receive a range of support 
to empower them with the knowledge and resources they need 
to progress against their energy reduction targets. In 2022, we 
launched the IHG HERO tool, which guides hotels on the most 
effective energy conservation measures for their specific building. 
The tool provides indicative capital costs, energy reductions and 
payback periods for a range of energy conservation measures based 
on the hotel’s facilities, climate and energy consumption. Since we 
launched the tool in 2022, over 560 hotels have used it to guide 
their capital spending. The tool is available across our EMEAA and 
Americas regions and is expected to launch in Greater China in 
2024, following a successful pilot programme in 2023.

Our Energy & Carbon Reduction Training’ e-learning modules advise 
hotel colleagues on how to reduce costs, drive revenue and increase 
the asset value of their property by providing effective strategies 
to reduce their hotel’s energy consumption and carbon footprint. 
These modules also cover the global context, the commercial and 
competitive advantages of sustainability efforts, and what hotels 
need to do to meet their energy reduction targets. We also have a 
decarbonisation module for our corporate colleagues. In 2023, we 
led multiple training workshops for key business functions to engage 
them on how their role can support us to deliver our decarbonisation 
commitments.

We are supporting hotels to identify tax and other financial incentives 
available to them to help fund energy efficiency investments. 
Owners in our Americas region have access, free of charge, to 
reports on tax incentives and utility rebates available to their hotels. 
We have also partnered with an ‘energy efficiency as a service’ 
supplier that provides financing, installation, and maintenance of 
energy conservation measures and then shares the energy cost 
savings with the hotel.

  See pages 28 to 32 of our 2023 Responsible Business Report for further 
information on our work across carbon and energy.

Going concern
An overview of the business activities of IHG, including a review of 
the key business risks that the Group faces, is given in the Strategic 
Report on pages 2 to 88 and in the Group information on pages 242 
to 254. 

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had total liquidity of $2,572m, 
comprising $1,350m of undrawn bank facilities and $1,222m of cash 
and cash equivalents (net of overdrafts and restricted cash).

There remains a wide range of possible planning scenarios over the 
going concern period. The scenarios considered and assessment 
made by the Directors in adopting the going concern basis for 
preparing these financial statements are included on page 161.

Based on the assessment completed, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient resources 
to continue operating until at least 30 June 2025, and there are 
no material uncertainties that may cast doubt on the Group’s 
going concern status. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.

 Please see the viability statement on pages 50 and 51.

Additional Information

Group information
History and developments

The Company was incorporated and registered in England and 
Wales with registered number 5134420 on 21 May 2004 as a limited 
company under the Companies Act 1985 with the name Hackremco 
(No. 2154) Limited. In 2004/05, as part of a scheme of arrangement 
to facilitate the return of capital to shareholders, the following 
structural changes were made to the Group: (i) on 24 March 2005, 
Hackremco (No. 2154) Limited changed its name to New 
InterContinental Hotels Group Limited; (ii) on 27 April 2005, New 
InterContinental Hotels Group Limited re-registered as a public 
limited company and changed its name to New InterContinental 
Hotels Group PLC; and (iii) on 27 June 2005, New InterContinental 
Hotels Group PLC changed its name to InterContinental Hotels 
Group PLC and became the holding company of the Group.

The Group, formerly known as Bass, and then Six Continents, 
was historically a conglomerate operating as, among other things, 
a brewer, soft drinks manufacturer, hotelier, leisure operator, and 
restaurant, pub and bar owner. In 1988 Bass acquired Holiday Inn 
International and the remainder of the Holiday Inn brand in 1990. 
The InterContinental brand was acquired by Bass in 1998 and the 
Candlewood Suites brand was acquired by Six Continents in 2003.

On 15 April 2003, following shareholder and regulatory approval, 
Six Continents PLC separated into two new listed groups, 
InterContinental Hotels Group PLC, comprising the hotels and soft 
drinks businesses, and Mitchells & Butler plc, comprising the retail 
and standard commercial property developments business.

The Group disposed of its interests in the soft drinks business by way 
of an initial public offering of Britvic (Britannia Soft Drinks Limited for 
the period up to 18 November 2005, and thereafter, Britannia SD 
Holdings Limited (renamed Britvic plc on 21 November 2005), which 
became the holding company of the Britvic Group on 18 November 
2005), a manufacturer and distributor of soft drinks in the UK, in 
December 2005. The Group now continues as a stand-alone 
hotels business.

Recent acquisitions and divestitures
The Group made no acquisitions or disposals in 2023 or 2022. 
In 2021, the Group disposed of a portfolio of three EVEN Hotels 
in the Americas region resulting in a net cash inflow of $44m.

  Further information is included in note 11 to the Group Financial 
Statements on page 186. 

Capital expenditure
•  Gross capital expenditurea in 2023 totalled $253 million compared 
with $161 million in 2022 and $100 million in 2021, see page 230.

•  At 31 December 2023, capital committed (being contracts placed 
for expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets not provided for in the Group Financial Statements) totalled 
$10 million, see page 212.

a  Definitions for Non-GAAP revenue and operating profit measures can be found on 

pages 84 to 88. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable line 
items within the Group Financial Statements can be found on pages 226 to 231.

Several other factors will continue to remain important to the Group’s 
outlook, including those relating to operational resilience, such as 
the safety and security of hotel operations; guest preferences for 
branded hotel experiences and loyalty in a competitive industry 
where expectations continue to evolve; and its ability to attract and 
retain talent and capability where key aspects of the Group’s growth 
ambitions and operations are dependent on access to experience 
and knowledge.

The Group also faces emerging risks where the impact and 
likelihood are not yet fully understood or factors that may become 
significant in the medium- to long-term. This includes uncertainty 
linked to the rapidly evolving wider macroeconomic and geopolitical 
factors, including government policy and how this might impact 
travel patterns and business relationships, central bank policy and 
how this might impact development and financing costs of owners, 
rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technology, 
and the physical risks of climate change on the Group’s activities.

To enable focus on the material risk factors facing the Group, the 
detail below has been organised under headings corresponding to 
the ordering of the principal risks outlined earlier in this document.

  The principal risks are on pages 45 to 49, the cautionary statements 
regarding forward-looking statements are on page 263 and financial and 
forward-looking information in note 8 on pages 181 to 185, and note 24 
on pages 199 to 203.

Risk factors

The Group is subject to a variety of inherent risks that may have 
an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition, 
turnover, profits, brands and reputation. This section describes the 
main risks that could materially affect the Group’s business. The risks 
below are not the only ones that the Group faces. Some risks are 
not yet known to the Group and some risks that the Group does not 
currently believe to be material could later turn out to be material.

During 2023, the Group continued to face risks relating to macro 
external factors, including the impact of continuing inflationary 
pressures and challenges to labour availability in key markets, ongoing 
conflict in Ukraine and, towards the end of the year, in the Middle East. 
These factors contributed to additional political, economic and 
financial market developments and uncertainties, including global 
supply chain disruptions, continuing cybersecurity threat levels, 
and increases to the cost of borrowing due to rising interest rates.

Following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the Group ceased all 
operations in Russia due to the ongoing and increasing challenges 
of operating there and consistent with evolving UK, US and EU 
sanction regimes. The Group continues to monitor the impact of the 
war in relation to our two hotels in Ukraine, both of which are open 
to the public.

The Group’s refreshed strategy will require balancing of short-term 
execution and long-term goals, along with resilience in an 
environment of uncertainties relating to, for example, its ability to 
deliver innovation at scale and speed; how it uses, stores, secures 
and transfers data; owner preferences for and ability to invest in its 
brands; global and local supply chain efficiency and resiliency; and 
legal and regulatory complexity and litigation trends.

1. Guest preferences for branded hotel experiences and loyalty
The Group is subject to a competitive and changing industry
The Group competes against other global hotel chains, local hotel 
companies and independent hotels to win the loyalty of guests, 
employees and owners. The competitive landscape also includes 
other types of businesses, both global and specific to certain markets, 
such as web-based booking channels (which include online travel 
agents and intermediaries), and alternative sources of accommodation, 
such as short-term lets of private property. Failure to compete 
effectively in traditional and emerging areas of the business could 
impact the Group’s market share, system size, profitability and 
relationships with owners and guests. The hospitality industry has 
previously experienced consolidation, and further such activity may 
result in such competitors having access to increased resources, 
capabilities or capacity and provide advantages from scale of 
revenues, marketing funds and/or cost structures.

The Group is reliant on the reputation of its existing brands 
and is exposed to inherent reputation risks
Any event that materially damages the reputation of one or more of 
the Group’s brands and/or fails to sustain the appeal of the Group’s 
brands to its customers and owners may have an adverse impact 
on the value of that brand and subsequent revenues from that brand 
or business. In particular, if the Group is unable to create consistent, 
valued and quality products and guest experiences across the 
franchised, managed, owned, leased and managed lease hotels 
or if the Group, its franchisees or business partners fail to act 
responsibly, this could result in an adverse impact on its brand 
reputation. In addition, the value of the Group’s brands could be 
influenced by a number of external factors outside the Group’s 
control, such as, but not limited to, changes in sentiments against 
global brands, changes in applicable regulations related to the hotel 
industry or to franchising, successful commoditisation of hotel 
brands by online travel agents and intermediaries, or changes in 
owners’ perceptions of the value of the Group.

The Group is exposed to inherent uncertainties associated 
with brand development and expansion
The Group has launched eight brands in six years and also maintains 
co-branded credit card relationships to support the IHG Rewards 
programme. Since the rollout, integration and growth of these 
brands (including associated loyalty programmes) is dependent on 
market conditions, guest preference and owner investment, as well 
as continued cooperation with third parties, there are inherent risks 
that we will be unable to recover costs incurred in developing or 
acquiring the brands or any new programmes or products, or those 
brands, programmes, or products will not succeed as we intend. 
The Group’s ongoing agenda to deliver industry-leading net rooms 
growth creates risks relating to the transition of systems, new or 
changed operating models, services and processes, and may result 
in failures to improve commercial performance, leading to financial 
loss and undermining stakeholder confidence.

2. Owner preferences for or ability to invest in our brands
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks related to identifying, 
securing and retaining franchise and management agreements
The Group’s growth strategy depends on its success in identifying, 
securing and retaining franchise and management agreements. 
This is an inherent risk for the hotel industry and the franchising 
business and management model. Competition with other hotel 
companies may generally reduce the number of suitable franchise, 
management and investment opportunities offered to the Group 
and increase the bargaining position of property owners seeking 
to become a franchisee or engage a manager. The terms of new 
franchise or management agreements may not be as favourable as 
current arrangements; the Group may not be able to renew existing 
arrangements on similarly favourable terms, or at all.

There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to identify, 
retain or add franchisees to the IHG System, to secure management 
contracts or open hotels in our development pipeline. For example, 
the availability of suitable sites, market saturation, planning and other 
local regulations or the availability and affordability of finance, which 
has remained a challenge in 2023, may restrict the supply of suitable 
hotel development opportunities under franchise or management 
agreements and mean that not every hotel in our development 
pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system. 
In connection with entering into franchise or management agreements, 
the Group may be required to make investments in, or guarantee the 
obligations of, third parties or guarantee minimum income to third 
parties. There are also risks that significant franchisees or groups of 
franchisees may have interests that conflict, or are not aligned, with 
those of the Group, including, for example, the unwillingness of 
franchisees to support individual or masterbrand or system 
improvement initiatives. This could result in franchisees prematurely 
terminating contracts, which could lead to disputes, litigation, 
damages and other expenses and would adversely impact the 
overall IHG System size and the Group’s financial performance.

The Group is exposed to the risks of hotel industry overcapacity
The future operating results of the Group could be adversely affected by 
industry overcapacity (by number of rooms) and weak demand due, 
for example, to customer confidence in business and leisure travel, 
whether related to pandemics, war, or otherwise, the cyclical nature of 
the hotel industry, other differences between planning assumptions 
and actual operating conditions, cost-of-living pressures and changes 
in stakeholder expectations around environmental factors. These 
conditions could result in reductions in room rates and occupancy levels, 
which would adversely impact the financial performance of the Group.

3. Our ability to attract and retain talent and capability
The Group requires the right people, skills and capability 
to manage growth and change
In order to remain competitive, the Group relies upon hiring and 
retaining highly skilled employees with particular expertise or 
leadership capability. The Group’s strategic business plans could 
be undermined by a failure to build and sustain a resilient corporate 
culture, failure to recruit or retain key personnel, unexpected loss 
of key senior employees, inadequate succession planning and 
incentive plans, or failure to invest in the development of key skills.

The Group must compete against other companies inside and 
outside the hospitality industry for suitably qualified or experienced 
employees, up to and including Executive Directors. Some of the 
markets in which the Group operates may experience economic 
growth and/or low levels of unemployment, pay compression, and 
there may be attractive roles and competitive rewards available 
elsewhere which limit the ability to attract and retain talent.

Labour shortages could restrict our ability and the ability of 
franchisees to operate hotel properties or grow our business or 
could result in increased costs that could adversely affect results of 
operations. The Covid-19 pandemic negatively affected the labour 
market for employers. Staffing shortages in various parts of the 
world could hinder our ability to grow and expand our business. 
Some emerging markets may not have the required local expertise 
to operate a hotel, particularly for luxury and lifestyle brands, and 
may not be able to attract the right talent. 

If we or our franchisees are unable to attract, retain, train, manage 
and engage skilled individuals, the ability to staff and operate the 
hotels that we manage, own or franchise could be diminished. 
This could reduce customer satisfaction and adversely affect the 
reputation of our brands. Labour costs may also increase, threatening 
the ability to operate hotels and our corporate support functions, 
achieve business growth targets or impact the profitability of our 
operations. Additionally, unless the Group maintains a sufficient 
infrastructure to enable knowledge and skills to be passed on, the 
Group risks losing accumulated knowledge if key employees leave.

Additional Information

Group information continued
Risk factors continued

Collective bargaining activity could disrupt operations, increase 
our labour costs or interfere with the ability of our management 
to focus on executing our business strategies.
A significant number of the Group’s colleagues at its managed, 
owned, leased and managed lease hotels in the US, Canada, Mexico, 
Grand Cayman and Netherlands Antilles are covered by collective 
bargaining agreements and similar agreements. If relationships 
with those colleagues or the unions that represent them deteriorate, 
the properties we own, lease or manage could experience labour 
disruptions such as strikes, lockouts, boycotts and public 
demonstrations. In 2024, bargaining agreements in major cities will 
be expiring within several months of each other. There will be labour 
activity in many of our major markets, including Washington DC, 
San Diego, Boston and San Francisco. Hotel sector union member 
participation continues to increase in key markets within the 
Americas region, which may require IHG to enter into new labour 
agreements as more employees become unionised in the future. 
Labour disputes, which are generally more likely when collective 
bargaining agreements are being renegotiated, could harm our 
relationship with our colleagues, result in increased regulatory 
inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter 
guests. Further, adverse publicity related to a labour dispute could 
harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. 

Labour regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective 
bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs, 
changes in work rules that raise operating expenses, legal costs and 
limitations on our ability or the ability of our third-party property 
owners to take cost-saving measures during economic downturns. 
We do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective 
bargaining agreements covering unionised labour employed by our 
third-party property owners and franchisees. Increased unionisation 
of our workforce, new labour legislation or changes in regulations 
could disrupt our operations, reduce our profitability or interfere 
with the ability of our management to focus on executing our 
business strategies.

4. Data and information usage, storage, security and transfer
The Group is exposed to cybersecurity and data privacy risks
The Group is increasingly dependent upon the collection, usage, 
retention, availability, integrity and confidentiality of information, 
including, but not limited to: guest, employee and owner credit card, 
financial and personal data, business performance, financial reporting 
and commercial development. The information is sometimes held in 
different formats, such as digital, paper, voice recordings and video, 
and could be stored in many places, including cloud-based storage 
and facilities managed by third-party service providers, in our 
managed hotels, and by our independently owned and operated 
hotels, that are all subject to the same or similar risks.

Cyber breaches are increasingly becoming an unfortunate reality 
for most companies and risks relating to cybersecurity appear to be 
heightened in light of geopolitical conflicts. The threats towards the 
hospitality industry and the Group’s information are dynamic, and 
include cyber-attacks, fraudulent use, loss or misuse by employees 
and breaches of our vendors’ security arrangements, among others.

For example, in 2022, parts of the Group’s technology systems were 
subject to unauthorised activity, causing disruption to the Group’s 
booking channels and other applications. A putative class action suit 
has been filed by a small group of hotel owners related to the incident. 
This cybersecurity breach follows additional previous cybersecurity 
incidents of a different nature in 2016. 

The legal and regulatory environment around data privacy and 
requirements set out by the payment card industry surrounding 
information security across the many jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates are constantly evolving (such as the EU GDPR, 
China cybersecurity law, and US State privacy laws). If the Group 
fails to protect information and ensure relevant controls are in place 
to enable the acceptable use and release of information through the 

appropriate channels in a timely and accurate manner, IHG System 
performance, guest experience and the reputation of the Group 
may be adversely affected. This could lead to revenue losses, fines, 
penalties, litigation and other additional costs.

We are required to comply with marketing and advertising laws 
relating to our direct marketing practices, including email marketing, 
online advertising, including in our use of generative artificial 
intelligence, and postal mailings. Further restrictions to the content or 
interpretations of these laws could adversely impact our current and 
planned activities and the effectiveness or viability of our marketing 
strategies to maintain, extend and acquire relationships with customers, 
and impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products.

  For information of incidents and ongoing legal proceedings relating to 
cybersecurity, data privacy and trade practices, see pages 212 and 254. 

The Group is exposed to intellectual property risks
Given the importance of brand recognition to the Group’s business, 
the protection of its intellectual property poses a risk due to the 
variability and changes in controls, laws and effectiveness of 
enforcement globally, particularly in jurisdictions that may not 
have developed levels of protection for corporate assets, such 
as intellectual property, trade secret, know-how and customer 
information and records. Any widespread infringement, 
misappropriation or weakening of the control environment could 
materially harm the value of the Group’s brands and its ability 
to develop the business and compete currently or in the future. 
Third-party claims that we infringe their intellectual property 
could lead to disputes, litigation, damages and other expenses.

5. Ethical and social expectations
The Group’s reputation and the value of its brands are influenced 
by the perception of various stakeholders of the Group
The reputation of the Group and the value of its brands are 
influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the perception 
of stakeholder groups, such as guests, owners, suppliers and 
communities in which the Group operates. The social and 
environmental impacts of its business are under increasing scrutiny, 
and the Group is exposed to the risk of damage to its reputation 
if it fails to (or fails to influence its business partners to) undertake 
responsible practices and engage in ethical behaviour, or fails to 
comply with relevant regulatory requirements.

6. Legal and regulatory complexity or litigation trends
The Group is required to comply with existing and changing 
regulations and act in accordance with societal expectations 
across numerous countries, territories and jurisdictions
Government regulations affect countless aspects of the Group’s 
business, including corporate governance, health and safety, 
the environment, social responsibility, bribery and corruption, 
employment law and diversity, franchise laws and regulation, 
disability access, data privacy and information protection, financial, 
accounting and tax. Regulatory changes may require significant 
changes in the way the business operates and may inhibit the 
Group’s strategy, including the markets the Group operates in, 
brand protection, and use or transmittal of personal data and use 
of artificial intelligence. If the Group fails to comply with existing 
or changing regulations, the Group may be subject to fines, 
prosecution, loss of licence to operate or reputational damage.

Companies that operate franchise systems may be subject to 
liabilities and claims relating to the franchisor/franchisee relationship, 
such as for allegedly being a ‘joint employer’ with a franchisee. 
Changes in laws or regulations relating to this relationship could 
result in a determination that we are a joint employer with our 
franchisees or that our franchisees are part of one unified system 
subject to joint and several liability. Such a determination could 
subject us to liability for employment-related and other liabilities 
of our franchisees and could cause us to incur other costs that have 
a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profit.

The Group is exposed to the risk of litigation
Certain companies in the Group are the subject of various claims 
and proceedings. The ultimate outcome of these matters is subject 
to many uncertainties, including future events and uncertainties 
inherent in litigation. In addition, the Group could be at risk of 
litigation claims made by many parties, including but not limited to: 
guests, customers, joint venture partners, suppliers, employees, 
regulatory authorities, franchisees and/or the owners of the hotels 
it manages. Claims filed may include requests for punitive damages 
as well as compensatory damages. Unfavourable outcomes of 
claims or proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the 
Group’s results of operations, cash flow and/or financial position. 
Exposure to significant litigation or fines may also affect the 
reputation of the Group and its brands. (See also legal proceedings 
on page 254.)

Domestic and international environmental laws and regulations 
may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to 
potential liabilities
The Group is exposed to certain compliance costs and potential 
liabilities under various foreign and US federal, state and local 
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws 
and regulations govern actions and reporting requirements relating 
to matters including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal 
of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. 
The Group’s failure to comply with such laws, including any required 
permits or licences, could result in substantial fines or possible 
revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. 
We could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation, 
removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our 
currently or formerly franchised, managed, owned, leased or 
managed lease hotels or at third-party locations in connection 
with our waste disposal operations, regardless of whether or not 
we knew of, or caused, the presence or release of such substances. 
The Group may also be required to remediate such substances or 
remove, abate or manage asbestos, mould, radon gas, lead or other 
hazardous conditions at our properties. The presence or release of 
such toxic or hazardous substances could result in third-party claims 
for personal injury, property or natural resource damages, business 
interruption or other losses. Such claims and the need to investigate, 
remediate or otherwise address hazardous, toxic or unsafe 
conditions could adversely affect the Group’s operations, the value 
of any affected property, or our ability to sell, lease or assign our 
rights in any such property, or could otherwise harm our business 
or reputation. Environmental, health and safety requirements are 
increasingly stringent, and our costs may increase as a result.

The Group’s financial performance may be affected by changes 
in tax laws
Many factors will affect the Group’s future tax rate, the key ones 
being legislative developments, future profitability of underlying 
subsidiaries and tax uncertainties. Tax liabilities or refunds may also 
differ from those anticipated, in particular as a result of changes in 
tax law, changes in the interpretation of tax law, or clarification of 
uncertainties in the application of tax law. The Group continues 
to monitor significant tax reform proposals, most notably the 
development of the OECD’s ‘Pillar Two’ minimum tax regime; 
further information is included in note 8 to the Group Financial 
Statements on page 181.

7. Global and local supply chain efficiency and resilience
The Group is dependent upon a wide range of external 
stakeholders and business partners
The Group relies on the performance, behaviours and reputation 
of a wide range of business partners and external stakeholders, 
including, but not limited to, owners, contractors, lenders, suppliers, 
outsourced providers, vendors, joint-venture partners, online travel 
agents, third-party intermediaries and other business partners 
which may have different ethical values, interests and priorities. 
Further, the number and complexity of interdependencies with 

stakeholders is evolving. Breakdowns in relationships, contractual 
disputes, deterioration of the financial health of our partners, poor 
vendor performance, sub-standard control procedures, business 
continuity arrangements, insolvency, stakeholder behaviours or 
adverse reputations, which may be outside of the Group’s control, 
could adversely impact on the Group’s performance and 
competitiveness, delivery of projects, guest experiences or the 
reputation of the Group or its brands.

8. Operational resilience to incidents or disruption or control 
breakdown (including geopolitical, safety and security, 
cybersecurity, fraud and health-related)
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks associated with safety, 
security and crisis management
There is a constant need to protect the safety and security of our 
guests, employees and assets against natural and man-made threats. 
These include, but are not limited to, exceptional events, such as 
extreme weather, civil or political unrest, violence and terrorism, 
serious and organised crime, fraud, employee dishonesty, cyber 
crime, pandemics or contagious diseases, fire and day-to-day 
accidents, incidents and petty crime, which impact the guest or 
employee experience, could cause loss of life, sickness or injury and 
result in compensation claims, fines from regulatory bodies, litigation 
and impact reputation. Serious incidents or a combination of events 
could escalate into a crisis that, if managed poorly, could further 
expose the Group and its brands to significant reputational damage.

The Group is reliant upon the resilience of its reservation system 
and other key technology platforms and is exposed to risks that 
could disrupt their operation and/or integrity
The value of the Group is partly derived from the ability to drive 
reservations through its reservation system and technology 
platforms which are highly integrated with other processes and 
systems and linked to multiple sales channels, including the Group’s 
own websites, in-house and third-party managed call centres, 
hotels, third-party intermediaries and travel agents.

The scope and complexity of our technology infrastructure, 
including increasing reliance on third-party suppliers to support and 
protect our systems and information, as well as the rapidly evolving 
cyber threats, means that we are inherently vulnerable to physical 
damage, failures, disruptions, denial of service, phishing or other 
malware attacks, ransomware, cyber terrorism and fraud, as well 
as human error, negligence and wilful misuse. These risks may be 
heightened when these capabilities are provided offshore or in 
cloud-based environments. Our franchisees and suppliers are also 
inherently vulnerable to the same risks.

Lack of resilience and operational availability of these systems 
provided by the Group or third-party technology providers and 
inability or difficulty in updating existing or implementing new 
functionality could lead to prolonged service disruption. This might 
result in significant business interruption, impact the guest booking 
experience, lead to loss of or theft of data, and subsequently 
adversely impact Group revenues, incur financial costs to remediate 
or investigate, lead to regulatory and/or contractual enforcement 
actions or lawsuits, or damage the Group’s reputation and 
relationships with hotel owners.

The Group is exposed to political and economic developments
The Group is exposed to political, economic and financial market 
developments, such as recession, inflation and availability and/or 
cost of credit (due to rising interest rates) and currency fluctuations 
that could lower revenues and reduce income. The outlook for 2024 
may worsen due to continued unrest and conflict in Ukraine, the 
Middle East, parts of Africa and Asia and other geopolitical tensions; 
potential disruptions in the US economy; uncertain central bank 
policies; the impact of fluctuating commodity prices (including oil) 
on economies dependent on such exports; and barriers to global 
trade, including unforeseeable changes in regulations, imposition 
of tariffs or embargoes and other trade restrictions or controls.

Additional Information

Group information continued
Risk factors continued

The interconnected nature of economies suggests any of these 
events, or other events, could trigger a recession that reduces leisure 
and business travel as demand for our services is closely associated 
with the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to 
business and personal discretionary spending levels. Decreased 
global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can 
be especially pronounced during economic downturns or low levels 
of economic growth, and the hospitality industry may fail to keep 
pace with overall economic improvement. Such declines in demand 
for our products and services could adversely affect room rates and/
or occupancy levels and other income-generating activities. 

Specifically, the Group is most exposed to the impact of political 
and economic risk factors in relation to the US market, including 
elections in 2024, and to Greater China. The owners or potential 
owners of hotels franchised or managed by the Group face similar 
risks that could adversely impact their solvency and the Group’s 
ability to secure and retain franchise or management agreements. 
Accordingly, the Group is particularly susceptible to adverse 
changes in these economies, as well as changes in their currencies. 
In addition to trading conditions, the economic outlook also affects 
the financial health of current and potential owners and their ability 
to access capital, which could impact existing operations, timely 
payment of IHG fees and the health of the pipeline.

The Group is exposed to continued disruption and consequences 
from the war in Ukraine 
The Group continues to monitor the impact of the war in relation 
to our two hotels in Ukraine, both of which are open to the public. 
The Group has ceased all operations in Russia. Although these 
operations were not material to consolidated financial results, 
the Group continues to face uncertainty relating to the broader 
consequences of this conflict on global macroeconomic conditions. 
These uncertainties include the potential for governments to 
impose additional sanctions or other economic or military measures. 
Further expansion or escalation of military confrontations or related 
geopolitical tensions, including increased restrictions on global 
trade, could also result in, among other things, depressed or 
restricted travel demand, declines in consumer confidence and 
economic growth, an increased likelihood of cyber attacks or 
information technology disruption, supply chain disruptions, 
increases in inflation rates, changes to foreign currency exchange 
rates, constraints, volatility or disruption in financial markets, the 
decreased availability of raw materials, supplies, freight and labour, 
and uncertainty about economic and global stability. 

The Group is also exposed to disruption and consequences 
from the conflict in the Middle East
The Group continues to face some disruption relating to the broader 
consequences of the Middle East conflict on neighbouring countries 
and on wider global macroeconomic uncertainty, including supply 
chain disruption through the region. Further expansion or escalation 
of military confrontations or related geopolitical tensions could also 
result in similar factors to those listed above relating to the war 
in Ukraine.

The Group may face difficulties insuring its business
Historically, the Group has maintained insurance at levels 
determined to be appropriate in light of the cost of cover and the 
risk profile of the business. However, the Group’s claims experience 
and wider external market forces may limit the scope of coverage 
the Group can obtain and the Group’s ability to obtain coverage at 
reasonable rates. Other forces beyond the Group’s control, such as 
terrorist attacks or natural disasters, may be uninsurable or simply 
too expensive to insure. Inadequate or insufficient insurance carried 
by the Group, our owners or other partners for damage, other 
potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties 
that we own, manage or franchise could expose the Group to large 
claims or could result in the loss of capital invested in properties.

246

IHG  |  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

The Group is exposed to risks related to executing and realising 
benefits from strategic transactions, including acquisitions 
and restructuring
The Group may seek to make strategic transactions, including 
acquisitions, divestments or investments in the future. The Group 
may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions 
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and may not realise the 
anticipated benefits from such transactions. Strategic transactions 
come with inherent valuation, financial and commercial risks, and 
regulatory and insider information risks during the execution of the 
transactions. The Group may also continue to make organisational 
adjustments to support delivery of our growth ambitions, including 
the integration of acquisitions into the Group’s operating processes 
and systems. This creates inherent risks of complexity and that any 
changes made could be unsustainable or that we are unable to 
achieve the return envisaged through reinvestment. In addition, 
the Group may face unforeseen costs and liabilities, diversion of 
management attention, as well as longer-term integration and 
operational risks, which could result in a failure to realise benefits, 
financial losses, lower employee morale and loss of talent.

The Group is exposed to a variety of risks associated with its 
financial stability and ability to borrow and satisfy debt covenants
While the strategy of the Group is to grow through activities that do 
not involve significant amounts of its own capital, the Group does 
require capital to fund some development opportunities, technological 
innovations and strategic acquisitions; and to maintain and improve 
owned, leased and managed lease hotels. The Group is reliant upon 
having financial strength and access to capital markets and other 
borrowing facilities to meet these expected capital requirements. 
The Group’s $1,350m revolving credit facility (RCF) is only available 
if the financial covenants in the facility are complied with. 
Non-compliance with covenants could result in the Group’s lenders 
demanding repayment of the funds advanced and any undrawn 
facilities could be unavailable. In addition, if the RCF was drawn and 
repayment was demanded, it would trigger a repayment of the bond 
debt. If the Group’s financial performance does not meet market 
expectations, it may not be able to refinance existing bond and bank 
facilities on terms considered favourable. 

The Group currently has a senior unsecured long-term credit rating 
of BBB from S&P and, since 2023, a Baa2 rating from Moody’s. 
In the event of either rating being downgraded below BBB- and 
Baa3 respectively (a downgrade of two levels) there would be an 
additional step-up coupon of 1.25% payable on the public bonds 
which are subject to those ratings.

The Group’s operations are dependent on maintaining sufficient 
liquidity to meet all foreseeable medium-term requirements 
and provide headroom against unforeseen obligations
Cash and cash equivalents are held in short-term deposits, money 
market funds and repurchase agreements with short maturities. 
Most of the Group’s funds are held in the UK or US, although 
$30 million (2022: $24 million) is held in countries where repatriation 
is restricted as a result of foreign exchange regulations. Medium and 
long-term borrowing requirements are met through the bonds and 
RCF. Short-term borrowing requirements may be met from drawings 
under uncommitted overdrafts and RCF.

The Group is exposed to an impairment of the carrying value 
of our brands, goodwill or other tangible and intangible assets 
negatively affecting our consolidated operating results
Significant amounts of goodwill, intangible assets, right-of-use 
assets, property, plant and equipment, investments and contract 
assets are recognised on the Group balance sheet. We review the 
value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for 
impairment annually (or whenever events or circumstances indicate 
impairment may have occurred). Changes to estimated values can 
result from political, economic and financial market developments 
or other shifts in the business climate, the competitive environment, 
the perceived reputation of our brands (by guests or owners),

or changes in interest rates, operating cash flows, market 
capitalisation, or developments in the legal or regulatory environment. 
Because of the significance of our goodwill and other non-current 
assets, we have incurred and may incur future impairment charges 
on these assets which could have a material adverse effect on our 
financial results. Due to significant challenges and uncertainty in the 
data associated with both risks and opportunities, the Group is not 
yet able to fully quantify the potential financial impacts of climate 
change. The Group continues to refine its workplan to enable 
quantification in the future and is focused on ensuring the identified 
risks and opportunities are integrated into our business strategy. 

The Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, currency 
devaluations or restructurings and to interest rate risk in relation 
to its borrowings
The US dollar is the predominant currency of the Group’s revenue 
and cash flows. Movements in foreign exchange rates can affect the 
Group’s reported profit, net liabilities and interest cover. The most 
significant exposures of the Group are in currencies that are freely 
convertible. The Group’s reported debt has an exposure to 
borrowings held in pounds sterling (including €1,000 million euro 
bonds which have been swapped into sterling using currency 
swaps). Conducting business in currencies other than US dollars 
exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates, currency devaluations, 
or restructurings. This could potentially lower our reported revenues, 
increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our operations. 
Exposure to these factors is linked to the pace of our growth in 
territories outside the US and, if the proportion of our revenues 
grows, this may increase the potential sensitivity to currency 
movements having an adverse impact on our results. The Group 
is also exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its fixed and 
floating rate borrowings and interest rates may be higher on new 
or replacement borrowings compared to existing interest rates. 
All of the current bond debt ($3,122m) is at fixed rates. The Group 
may use interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate exposure.

The Group could be affected by credit risk on treasury transactions
The Group uses long-term credit ratings from S&P, Moody’s and 
Fitch Ratings as a basis for setting its counterparty limits. In order to 
manage the Group’s credit risk exposure, the treasury function sets 
counterparty exposure limits using metrics including credit ratings, 
the relative placing of credit default swap pricings, tier 1 capital and 
share price volatility of the relevant counterparty. The Group trades 
only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s 
policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are 
subject to credit verification procedures. In respect of credit risk 
arising from financial assets, the Group’s exposure to credit risk 
arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure 
equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. 

9. Our ability to deliver technological or digital performance 
or innovation (at scale, speed, etc.)
The Group is exposed to inherent risks in relation to changing 
technology and systems
As the use of the internet, artificial intelligence, mobile and data 
technology grows, and new and disruptive technology solutions 
are developed, customer needs and expectations evolve at pace. 
The Group may find that its evolving technology capability is not 
sufficient and may have to make substantial additional investments 
in new technologies or systems to remain competitive. Failure to 
keep pace with developments in technologies or systems, and 
also with regulatory, risk and ethical considerations of how these 
developments are used, for example in relation to cross-border 
transfers of data, may put the Group at a competitive disadvantage. 
Generative artificial intelligence is an emerging technology that the 
Group expects will create uncertainty for the travel and hospitality 
sector and society in general. The primary impacts are considered 
to be in relation to how guests will find and interact with hotels, how 
colleagues will work and talent and capability attraction or retention 
(among others).

In addition, the technologies or systems that the Group chooses to 
deploy may not be commercially successful or the technology or 
system strategy may not be sufficiently aligned with the needs of the 
business. Any such failure could adversely affect guest experiences, 
and the Group may lose customers, fail to attract new customers, 
impact our appeal to owners, incur substantial costs or face other 
losses. This could further impact the Group’s reputation in regards 
to innovation. 

(See also ‘4. Data and information usage, storage, security 
and transfer’.)

The Group is exposed to competition from online travel agents 
and intermediaries
A proportion of the Group’s bookings originate from large 
multinational, regional and local online travel agents and 
intermediaries with which the Group has contractual arrangements 
and to which it pays commissions. These platforms offer a wide 
range of products, often across multiple brands, have growing 
booking and review capabilities, and may create the perception that 
they offer the lowest prices. Some of these online travel agents and 
intermediaries have strong marketing budgets and aim to create 
brand awareness and brand loyalty among consumers, which may 
impact the Group’s profitability, undermine the Group’s own booking 
channels and value to its hotel owners.

10. The impact of climate change on hospitality 
(physical and transition risks for IHG)
The Group is exposed to the risk of events or stakeholder 
expectations that adversely impact domestic or international 
travel, including climate change
The room rates and occupancy levels of the Group could be 
adversely impacted by events that reduce domestic or international 
travel, such as actual or threatened acts of terrorism or war, political 
or civil unrest, epidemics and pandemics or threats thereof, 
travel-related accidents or industrial action, natural or man-made 
disasters, or other local factors impacting specific countries, cities 
or individual hotels, as well as increased transportation and fuel 
costs. Additionally, the Group may be impacted by increasing 
stakeholder and societal expectations and attitudes in relation to 
factors contributing to climate change including overtravel and 
overtourism, and those linked directly to hotels including waste, 
water, energy, or impact on local communities. A decrease in the 
demand for business and/or leisure hotel rooms as a result of such 
events or attitudinal and demand shifts may have an adverse impact 
on the Group’s operations or growth prospects and financial results. 
In addition, inadequate planning, preparation, response or recovery 
in relation to a major incident or crisis may cause loss of life, prevent 
operational continuity, or result in financial loss, and consequently 
impact the value of our brands and/or the reputation of the Group.

The Group is exposed to risks relating to our commitments 
in relation to Climate Change
In line with our commitment to reduce our energy use and carbon 
emissions in line with climate science, the Group has implemented a 
2030 science-based target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2, and scope 
3 greenhouse gas emissions from fuel and energy-related activities 
and franchises by 46.2% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. This ambition 
is challenging to implement and will require significant transformation 
across IHG, hotel owners and supply chain partners, including 
investment in physical assets and operational procedures. It is also 
dependent on government financial incentives, the decarbonisation 
of electricity grids and hotel owners having access to scalable, 
cost-effective renewable energy, as well as new operational behaviours 
and mindset shifts, including from guests, to adapt to low-energy 
products and services. If these changes, many of which are outside 
of IHG’s control, do not occur, the Group may have difficulty achieving 
its public commitments, which may impact the reputation of 
the Group.

Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity governance 
IHG’s board of directors is ultimately accountable for establishing a 
framework of prudent and effective controls, which enable risk to be 
assessed and managed. Management, including the Chief Information 
Security Officer (CISO) and our cybersecurity team, regularly update 
the Board on the company’s cybersecurity programmes, material 
risks and mitigation strategies and provide status and risk reports at 
least annually. The audit committee reviews the appropriateness of 
IHG’s risk management system to address risks and has allocated 
particular attention to cybersecurity and governance in the context 
of previous criminal, unauthorised access to the Group’s 
technology systems. 

Management is responsible for identifying, considering and 
assessing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, 
establishing processes to ensure that such potential exposures are 
monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures and 
maintaining cybersecurity programmes. This is guided by periodic 
external third-party assessment of IHG’s cyber risks and the maturity 
of the cybersecurity programme. The cyber incident response 
framework uses defined playbooks, coordinating with external 
incident response groups and aligning with wider IHG crisis 
management and escalation protocols, including triggers for 
reporting to senior management, board of directors and external 
parties where required.

IHG’s CISO has overall responsibility for the Information Security 
strategy and the development and management of the associated 
programme. The CISO was hired by IHG in 2018 from Invesco, 
a global investment management company, where he built and 
ran the cybersecurity programme as CISO for more than 10 years. 
The CISO is supported by a dedicated, certified and experienced 
in-house team, complemented by outsourced groups for performing 
either highly repetitive or operational tasks or for very specialised 
skillsets such as penetration testing or cyber forensics. The CISO 
receives reports from the team to enable the monitoring of the 
prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of 
cybersecurity incidents.

IHG employs several independent or third-party mechanisms to 
provide a level of assurance that the different information security 
capabilities are operating effectively and assessment of risk is also 
informed by observations arising from a variety of independent 
auditing either from IHG’s Internal Audit function or as part of 
regulatory compliance work performed including Sarbanes-Oxley, 
HIPAA, SWIFT, SOC-1 and MLPS (China). As noted above, periodic 
external assessments are also conducted of the maturity of the 
cybersecurity programme, which are also reported to the board 
of directors.

Cybersecurity risk management
Cybersecurity is an integral part of IHG’s overall risk management 
and internal control system. Our information security risk 
management programme follows the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology Cyber Security Framework and supports the 
identification of the systems, data, and other information assets that 
are considered most sensitive from a confidentiality perspective, 
or most critical from an availability perspective. These include guest 
data, credit card data, pre-public financial information, and revenue 
generating applications. 

Standards, policies and procedures are in place to manage how 
personal data can be used and protected across IHG, including a 
requirement for participation by all employees in annual e-learning 
training on handling information responsibly. 

The Information Security programme incorporates:

•  Engagement with leaders from other IHG business functions, 

including to identify and assess cybersecurity threats, and to act 
as point of contact for escalation of issues and incidents.

•  User awareness and colleague engagement, including 

communications to corporate and hotel teams on changing threats 
and phishing simulation exercises to raise risk awareness.

•  Maintenance of information risk management processes including 

a risk register and standard contract language. 

•  Risk assessment of third parties based on access to IHG systems, 

data, and operational reliance using a combination of manual 
procedures, for example, completion of security questionnaires, 
and independent cyber risk scoring. Critical rated third parties are 
reviewed annually.

•  Security compliance to coordinate required tracking of 

compliance for applicable regulations and standards, including 
remediation of any regulatory and audit findings.

•  Security engineering and architecture to define, implement and 

maintain standards for the secure use of core technology platforms 
and solutions, including new technology solutions and potential 
business partners and acquisitions.

•  Assessment of the security of individual business applications 
and platforms, including good security hygiene within coding.

•  Vulnerability management for all technical components of 

infrastructure and core application platforms.

•  Identity and access management for global platforms and 

solutions, including privileged access management, and loyalty 
account members. 

•  Cyber threat intelligence relationships with worldwide law 

enforcement and intelligence sharing organisations, profiling likely 
threat actors and methods, and providing insight on threat levels.

•  Security operations monitoring, triaging alerts to facilitate 

response and action within agreed service level agreements.

•  Cyber incident response using agreed and practised playbooks 
for security events, coordinating with external incident response 
groups and wider IHG crisis protocols, and deploying tabletop 
exercises to simulate scenarios and identify potential gaps 
in response.

•  Center of Excellence project management, continuous process 

improvement, tracking of key performance metrics, change 
management, and communications to internal, executive and 
external stakeholder groups.

In 2023 we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have 
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our 
business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. 
However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from 
cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not 
experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident. As we explained 
in our 6 and 29 September 2022 Stock Exchange Announcements, 
parts of our technology systems were subject to unauthorised 
activity, causing disruption to our booking channels and other 
applications. In line with our crisis management framework, teams 
across IHG came together to evaluate and address the incident, 
supported by external specialists. No evidence of unauthorised 
access to systems storing guest data was identified. The Board 
was engaged throughout the incident response.

  For more information about our risks, please refer to pages 42 to 49 
and pages 242 to 247.

Executive Directors’ benefits upon termination of office

All current Executive Directors have a rolling service contract with a notice period from the Group of 12 months. As an alternative, the Group 
may, at its discretion, pay in lieu of that notice. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross misconduct.

Payment in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months’ salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months’ pension contributions and 
other contractual benefits. Where possible, the Group will seek to ensure that, where a leaver mitigates their losses by, for example, finding 
new employment, there will be a corresponding reduction in compensation payable for loss of office.

  Visit ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate governance in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy section for further details about the determination 
of termination payments in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

As such, a Director has no power, in the absence of an independent 
quorum, to vote on compensation to themselves, but may vote on 
a resolution (and may count in the quorum of the meeting at which 
it was passed) to award compensation to Directors provided those 
arrangements do not confer a benefit solely on them.

The Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the 
Company to borrow money, subject to any limitation in the Articles 
(currently $5 billion), unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution 
of the Company. 

Under the Articles, there are no age limit requirements relating to 
a person’s qualification to hold office as a Director of the Company.

Directors are not required to hold any shares of the Company by way 
of qualification.

The Articles require annual retirement and re-election of all Directors 
at the AGM.

Rights attaching to shares
Dividend rights and rights to share in the Company’s profits
Under English law, dividends are payable on the Company’s ordinary 
shares only out of profits available for distribution, as determined in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK 
and by the Companies Act. No dividend will bear interest as against 
the Company.

Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
such dividends as may be declared by the shareholders in general 
meeting, rateably according to the amounts paid up on such shares, 
provided that the dividend cannot exceed the amount 
recommended by the Directors.

The Company’s Board of Directors may declare and pay to 
shareholders such interim dividends as appear to them to be justified 
by the Company’s financial position. If authorised by an ordinary 
resolution of the shareholders, the Board of Directors may also direct 
payment of a dividend in whole or in part by the distribution of specific 
assets (and in particular of paid-up shares or debentures of any 
other company).

Any dividend unclaimed by a member (or by a person entitled by virtue 
of transmission on death or bankruptcy or otherwise by operation of 
law) after six years from the date the dividend was declared, or became 
due for payment, will be forfeited and will revert to the Company.

Voting rights
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled, in respect of their holdings 
of such shares, to receive notice of general meetings and to attend, 
speak and vote at such meetings in accordance with the Articles.

Voting at any general meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands 
unless a poll, which is a written vote, is duly demanded. On a show 
of hands, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy at 
a general meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares 
held. Resolutions put to the members at electronic general meetings 
shall be voted on by a poll, which poll votes may be cast by such 
electronic means as the Board in its sole discretion deems 
appropriate for the purposes of the meeting.

Articles of Association

The Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles) were first 
adopted with effect from 27 June 2005, were most recently 
amended at the AGM held on 7 May 2020 and are available on the 
Company’s website at ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate 
governance. The following summarises material rights of holders 
of the Company’s ordinary shares under the material provisions of 
the Articles and English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety 
by reference to the Companies Act and the Articles.

The Company’s shares may be held in certificated or uncertificated 
form. No holder of the Company’s shares will be required to make 
additional contributions of capital in respect of the Company’s 
shares in the future.

In the following description, a ‘shareholder’ is the person registered 
in the Company’s register of members as the holder of the 
relevant share.

Principal objects
The Company is incorporated under the name InterContinental Hotels 
Group PLC and is registered in England and Wales with registered 
number 5134420. The Articles do not restrict its objects or purposes.

Directors
Under the Articles, a Director may have an interest in certain matters 
(‘Permitted Interest’) without the prior approval of the Board, 
provided they have declared the nature and extent of such Permitted 
Interest at a meeting of the Directors or in the manner set out in 
Section 184 or Section 185 of the Companies Act.

Any matter in which a Director has a material interest, and which 
does not comprise a Permitted Interest, must be authorised by 
the Board in accordance with the procedure and requirements 
contained in the Articles. In particular, this includes the requirement 
that a Director may not vote on a resolution to authorise a matter in 
which they are interested, nor may they count in the quorum of the 
meeting at which such business is transacted.

Further, a Director may not vote in respect of any proposal in which 
they, or any person connected with them, has any material interest 
other than by virtue of their interests in securities of, or otherwise in 
or through, the Company, nor may they count in the quorum of the 
meeting at which such business is transacted. This is subject to 
certain exceptions, including in relation to proposals: (a) indemnifying 
them in respect of obligations incurred on behalf of the Company; 
(b) indemnifying a third party in respect of obligations of the Company 
for which the Director has assumed responsibility under an indemnity 
or guarantee; (c) relating to an offer of securities in which they will be 
interested as an underwriter; (d) concerning another body corporate 
in which the Director is beneficially interested in less than one per 
cent of the issued shares of any class of shares of such a body 
corporate; (e) relating to an employee benefit in which the Director 
will share equally with other employees; and (f) relating to liability 
insurance that the Company is empowered to purchase for the 
benefit of Directors of the Company in respect of actions 
undertaken as Directors (or officers) of the Company.

The Directors have authority under the Articles to set their own 
remuneration (provided certain criteria are met). While an agreement 
to award remuneration to a Director is an arrangement with the 
Company that comprises a Permitted Interest (and therefore 
does not require authorisation by the Board in that respect), it is 
nevertheless a matter that would be expected to give rise to 
a conflict of interest between the Director concerned and the 
Company, and such conflict must be authorised by a resolution of the 
Board. The Director that is interested in such a matter may neither 
vote on the resolution to authorise such conflict, nor count in the 
quorum of the meeting at which it was passed. Furthermore, as noted 
above, the interested Director is not permitted to vote in respect of 
any proposal in which they have any material interest (except in 
respect of the limited exceptions outlined above) nor may they count 
in the quorum of the meeting at which such business is transacted.

Additional Information

Group information continued
Articles of Association continued

On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy 
has one vote for every share held by that shareholder. A poll may 
be demanded by any of the following:

•  the Chair of the meeting;

•  at least five shareholders present in person or by proxy and 

entitled to vote at the meeting;

•  any shareholder or shareholders present in person or by proxy 

representing in the aggregate not less than one-tenth of the total 
voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting; or

•  any shareholder or shareholders present in person or by proxy 
holding shares conferring a right to vote at the meeting and on 
which there have been paid up sums in the aggregate at least 
equal to one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares 
conferring that right.

A proxy form will be treated as giving the proxy the authority to 
demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one.

The necessary quorum for a general meeting is two persons 
carrying a right to vote upon the business to be transacted, whether 
present in person or by proxy.

Matters are transacted at general meetings of the Company by the 
proposing and passing of resolutions, of which there are two kinds:

•  an ordinary resolution, which includes resolutions for the election 
of Directors, the approval of financial statements, the cumulative 
annual payment of dividends, the appointment of the Auditor, the 
increase of share capital or the grant of authority to allot shares; 
and

•  a special resolution, which includes resolutions amending the 

Articles, disapplying statutory pre-emption rights, modifying the 
rights of any class of the Company’s shares at a meeting of the 
holders of such class or relating to certain matters concerning 
the Company’s winding up or changing the Company’s name.

An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of 
the votes of those persons present and entitled to vote at a meeting 
at which there is a quorum.

Special resolutions require the affirmative vote of not less than 
three-quarters of the persons present and entitled to vote at 
a meeting at which there is a quorum.

AGMs must be convened upon advance written notice of 21 days. 
Other meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of 
14 days. The days of delivery or receipt of the notice are not included. 
The notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted. 
The Board of Directors may, if they choose, make arrangements for 
shareholders, who are unable to attend the place of the meeting, to 
participate at other places or to allow for shareholders to attend and 
participate in shareholder meetings by electronic means.

Variation of rights
If, at any time, the Company’s share capital is divided into different 
classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, 
subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, with the consent 
in writing of holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued 
shares of that class or upon the adoption of a special resolution 
passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that 
class. At every such separate meeting, all of the provisions of the 
Articles relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except 
that the quorum is to be the number of persons (which must be two 
or more) who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in 
nominal value of the issued shares of that class.

Rights in a winding-up
Except as the Company’s shareholders have agreed or may 
otherwise agree, upon the Company’s winding up, the balance of 
assets available for distribution is to be distributed among the holders 
of ordinary shares according to the amounts paid up on the shares 
held by them:

•  after the payment of all creditors including certain preferential 
creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal 
creditors; and

•  subject to any special rights attaching to any class of shares.

This distribution is generally to be made in cash. A liquidator may, 
however, upon the adoption of a special resolution of the shareholders, 
divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the 
Company’s assets in kind.

Limitations on voting and shareholding
There are no limitations imposed by English law or the Articles on 
the right of non-residents or foreign persons to hold or vote the 
Company’s ordinary shares or ADSs, other than the limitations that 
would generally apply to all of the Company’s shareholders.

Working Time Regulations 1998

In the UK, many employees of Group companies are covered by the 
Working Time Regulations, which came into force on 1 October 1998. 
These regulations implemented the EU Working Time Directive and 
parts of the Young Workers Directive, and lay down rights and 
protections for employees in areas such as maximum working hours, 
minimum rest time, minimum days off and paid leave. The Working 
Time Regulations continue to apply in the UK following the UK’s exit 
from the EU as retained EU law under the European Union 
(Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.

In the UK, there is in place a national minimum wage under the 
National Minimum Wage Act 1998, as amended. At 31 December 
2023, the minimum wage for individuals aged 18 to 20 was £7.49 
per hour, aged 21 to 22 was £10.18 per hour and for those aged 23 or 
over was £10.42 per hour in each case, excluding apprentices aged 
under 19 years or, otherwise, in the first year of their apprenticeships. 

This particularly impacts businesses in the hospitality and retailing 
sectors. Compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act is being 
monitored by the Low Pay Commission, an independent statutory 
body established by the UK Government.

None of the Group’s UK employees are covered by collective 
bargaining agreements with trade unions.

Continual attention is paid to the external market in order to ensure 
that terms of employment are appropriate. The Group believes the 
Group companies will be able to conduct their relationships with 
trade unions and employees in a satisfactory manner.

Material contracts

The following contracts have been entered into otherwise than in 
the course of ordinary business by members of the Group: (i) in the 
two years immediately preceding the date of this document in the 
case of contracts which are or may be material; or (ii) that contain 
provisions under which any Group member has any obligation or 
entitlement that is material to the Group as at the date of this document. 
To the extent that these agreements include representations, 
warranties and indemnities, such provisions are considered standard 
in an agreement of that nature, save to the extent identified below.

Syndicated Facility
In April 2022, the Company, together with Six Continents Limited 
and InterContinental Hotels Limited (as borrowers and guarantors), 
signed a five-year $1.35 billion bank facility agreement (Syndicated 
Facility) with Bank of America Europe Designated Activity Company, 
Bank of China Limited, London Branch, Barclays Bank PLC, BNP 
Paribas, London Branch, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, London 
Branch, DBS Bank Ltd, London Branch, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., MUFG 
Bank, Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank, Truist Securities, Inc., Unicredit 
Bank AG, U.S. Bank National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 
London Branch all acting as lenders, mandated lead arrangers and 
joint bookrunners, and MUFG Bank, Ltd. as facility agent. 

During 2023, IHG Finance LLC, a Group company, acceded to 
the Syndicated Facility agreement as an additional guarantor and 
the Syndicated Facility agreement was amended to ensure that 
the implementation of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was accurately reflected in 
the agreement’s terms. The Company also exercised its ability to 
extend the term of the Syndicated Facility by an additional period 
of 12 months, taking its term to April 2028.

The interest margin payable on borrowings under the Syndicated 
Facility is linked to the long-term credit rating assigned to the senior 
unsecured and unsubordinated debt of the Company. The margin 
can vary between the applicable reference rate + 0.50% and the 
applicable reference rate + 1.00% depending on the credit rating. 
The Syndicated Facility was undrawn as at 31 December 2023. 

£4 billion Euro Medium Term Note programme
In 2023, the Group updated its Euro Medium Term Note programme 
(EMTN Programme) and issued a tranche of €600 million 4.375% 
notes due 28 November 2029 (2023 Issuance).

On 21 September 2023, an amended and restated trust deed (Trust 
Deed) was executed by the Company and IHG Finance LLC (IHGFL) 
as issuers (Issuers); the Company, IHGFL, Six Continents Limited and 
InterContinental Hotels Limited as guarantors (Guarantors) and U.S. 
Bank Trustees Limited as trustee (Trustee), pursuant to which the 
trust deed dated 27 November 2009, as supplemented by five 
supplemental trust deeds dated 7 July 2011, 9 November 2012, 
16 June 2015, 11 August 2016 and 14 September 2020 between the 
Company as issuer, Six Continents Limited and InterContinental 

Hotels Limited as guarantors and HSBC Corporate Trustee Company 
(UK) Limited as trustee relating to the Programme, was amended and 
restated. Under the Trust Deed, the Issuers may issue notes (Notes) 
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Guarantors, 
up to a maximum nominal amount from time to time outstanding 
of £4 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies). Notes are to be 
issued in series (each a Series) in bearer or registered form. Each 
Series may comprise one or more tranches (each a Tranche) issued 
on different issue dates. A Tranche of Notes may be issued on the 
terms and conditions set out in a base prospectus as amended 
and/or supplemented by a document setting out the final terms 
(Final Terms) of such Tranche or in a separate prospectus specific 
to such Tranche.

Under the Trust Deed, each of the Issuers and the Guarantors has 
given certain customary covenants in favour of the Trustee.

The Final Terms issued under the 2023 Issuance provide that 
the holders of the Notes have the right to repayment if the Notes 
(a) become non-investment grade within the period commencing 
on the date of announcement of a change of control and ending 
90 days after the change of control (Change of Control Period) and 
are not subsequently, within the Change of Control Period, reinstated 
to investment grade; (b) are downgraded from a non-investment 
grade and are not reinstated to its earlier credit rating or better 
within the Change of Control Period; or (c) are not credit rated and 
do not become investment grade credit rated by the end of the 
Change of Control Period.

On 21 September 2023, the Issuers and the Guarantors entered into 
an amended and restated agency agreement (Agency Agreement) 
with Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch as principal paying 
agent, Elavon Financial Services DAC as transfer agent and registrar 
and the Trustee, pursuant to which the Issuers and the Guarantors 
appointed paying agents and calculation agents in connection with 
the EMTN Programme and the Notes.

Under the Agency Agreement, each of the Issuers and the Guarantors 
has given a customary indemnity in favour of the paying agents and 
the calculation agents.

On 21 September 2023, the Issuers and the Guarantors entered into 
an amended and restated dealer agreement (Dealer Agreement) 
with Barclays Bank PLC as arranger and Bank of China Limited, London 
Branch, Barclays Bank PLC, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Merrill 
Lynch International, MUFG Securities EMEA plc, Truist Securities, Inc. 
and Wells Fargo Securities International Limited as dealers (Dealers), 
pursuant to which the Dealers were appointed in connection with 
the EMTN Programme and the Notes.

Under the Dealer Agreement, each of the Issuer and the Guarantors 
has given customary warranties and indemnities in favour of 
the Dealers.

Exchange controls and restrictions on payment of dividends

There are no restrictions on dividend payments to US citizens.

Although there are currently no UK foreign exchange control 
restrictions on the export or import of capital or the payment of 
dividends on the ordinary shares or the ADSs, economic sanctions 
which may be in force in the UK from time to time impose restrictions 
on the payment of dividends to persons resident (or treated as so 
resident) in or governments of (or persons exercising public 
functions in) certain countries.

Other than economic sanctions which may be in force in the UK 
from time to time, there are no restrictions under the Articles of 
Association or under English law that limit the right of non-resident 
or foreign owners to hold or vote the ordinary shares or the ADSs. 
In addition, the Articles contain certain limitations on the voting and 
other rights of any holder of ordinary shares whose holding may, in 
the opinion of the Directors, result in the loss or failure to secure the 
reinstatement of any licence or franchise from any US governmental 
agency held by Six Continents Hotels, Inc. or any subsidiary thereof.

Legal proceedings

Group companies have extensive operations in the UK, as well as 
internationally, and are involved in a number of legal claims and 
proceedings incidental to those operations. These legal claims and 
proceedings are in various stages and include disputes related to 
specific hotels where the potential materiality is not yet known. It is 
the Company’s view that such proceedings, either individually or in 
the aggregate, have not in the recent past and are not likely to have 
a significant effect on the Group’s financial position or profitability. 

Notwithstanding the above, the Company notes the matters set out 
below, which are ongoing. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and, 
as of 16 February 2024, unless stated otherwise, the outcome of 
these matters cannot be reasonably determined.

A claim was filed on 5 July 2016 by CPTS Hotel Lessee, LLC (CPTS) 
against Holiday Hospitality Franchising, LLC (HHF). The claimant 
alleged breach of the licence agreement and sought a declaratory 
judgement from the court that it had the right to terminate its 
licence with HHF. In June 2023, this case was dismissed.

A claim was filed on 26 June 2017 against InterContinental Hotels 
Corporation, InterContinental Hotels Group Resources, Inc., and 
InterContinental Hotels Group (Canada), Inc. seeking class action 
status and alleging breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, breach of 
confidence, intrusion upon seclusion, breach of contract, breach 
of privacy legislation, and unjust enrichment regarding an alleged 
data breach. The claim was amended in March 2018 to name Six 
Continents Hotels, Inc. as the sole defendant. The claimant alleges 
that security failures allowed customers’ financial information to be 
compromised. As of 16 February 2024, the likelihood of a favourable 
or unfavourable result cannot be reasonably determined, and it is 
not possible to determine whether any loss is likely or to estimate 
the amount of any loss.

Seven claims were filed in March 2022 against Holiday Hospitality 
Franchising LLC, Six Continents Hotels, Inc., and the IHG Owner’s 
Association, seeking class action status on behalf of IHG franchisees. 
Following dismissal of two claims and consolidation of the remaining, 
an amended claim was filed against Holiday Hospitality Franchising 
LLC and Six Continents Hotels, Inc., alleging claims for breach of 
contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, 
breach of fiduciary duty, declaratory judgement, violation of the 
Sherman Act and demand for accounting. The claims allege that 
IHG, as franchisor, is engaged in unlawful business practices relating 
to numerous programmes, products and requirements which are 
purportedly part of IHG’s franchise system. The Court dismissed the 
majority of the claims, and the remaining claims allege breach of

Shareholder information
Taxation

This section provides a summary of material US federal income tax 
and UK tax consequences to the US holders, described below, of 
owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs of the Company. 
This section addresses only the tax position of a US holder who 
holds ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets. This section does 
not, however, discuss all of the tax considerations that may be 
relevant to any particular US holder, such as the provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IR Code) known as 
the Medicare Contribution tax or tax consequences to US holders 
subject to special rules, such as:

•  certain financial institutions;

•  insurance companies;

•  dealers and traders in securities who use a mark-to-market 

method of tax accounting;

•  persons holding ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle, 
conversion transaction, integrated transaction or wash sale, 
or persons entering into a constructive sale with respect to the 
ordinary shares or ADSs;

•  persons whose functional currency for US federal income tax 

purposes is not the US dollar;

•  partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships for 

US federal income tax purposes; 

•  persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;

•  tax-exempt organisations;

•  persons who acquired the Company’s ADSs or ordinary shares 

pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise 
in connection with employment; and

•  persons who, directly or indirectly, own ordinary shares or ADSs 

representing 10% or more of the Company’s voting power or value.

This section does not generally deal with the position of a US holder 
who is resident in the UK for UK tax purposes or who is subject to UK 
taxation on capital gains or income by virtue of carrying on a trade, 
profession or vocation in the UK through a branch, agency or 
permanent establishment to which such ADSs or ordinary shares 
are attributable (‘trading in the UK’).

As used herein, a ‘US holder’ is a person who, for US federal income 
tax purposes, is a beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs and is: 
(i) a citizen or individual resident of the US; (ii) a corporation, or other 
entity taxable as a corporation, created or organised in or under the 
laws of the US, any state therein or the District of Columbia; (iii) an 
estate whose income is subject to US federal income tax regardless 
of its source; or (iv) a trust, if a US court can exercise primary 
supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more US 
persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of 
the trust.

This section is based on the IR Code, its legislative history, existing 
and proposed regulations, published rulings and court decisions, 
and on UK tax laws and the published practice of HM Revenue and 
Customs (HMRC), all as of the date hereof. These laws, and that 
practice, are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.

This section is further based in part upon the representations of 
the ADR Depositary and assumes that each obligation in the 
deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed 
in accordance with its terms. For US federal income tax purposes, 
an owner of ADRs evidencing ADSs will generally be treated as the 
owner of the underlying shares represented by those ADSs. For UK 
tax purposes, in practice, HMRC will also regard holders of ADSs 
as the beneficial owners of the ordinary shares represented by 
those ADSs (although case law has cast some doubt on this). 
The discussion below assumes that HMRC’s position is followed.

Generally, exchanges of ordinary shares for ADSs, and ADSs for 
ordinary shares, will not be subject to US federal income tax or UK 
taxation on capital gains, although UK stamp duty or stamp duty 
reserve tax (SDRT) may arise as described below.

Investors should consult their own tax advisers regarding the US 
federal, state and local, the UK and other tax consequences of 
owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs in their particular 
circumstances.

The following disclosures assume that the Company is not, and will 
not become, a passive foreign investment company (PFIC), except 
as described below.

Taxation of dividends
UK taxation
Under current UK tax law, the Company will not be required to 
withhold tax at source from dividend payments it makes.

A US holder who is not resident for UK tax purposes in the UK and 
who is not trading in the UK will generally not be liable for UK taxation 
on dividends received in respect of the ADSs or ordinary shares.

US federal income taxation
A US holder is generally subject to US federal income taxation on the 
gross amount of any dividend paid by the Company out of its current 
or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal 
income tax purposes). Distributions in excess of the Company’s 
current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for 
US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a return of capital 
to the extent of the US holder’s basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs 
and thereafter as capital gain. Because the Company has not 
historically maintained, and does not currently maintain, books in 
accordance with US tax principles, the Company does not expect 
to be in a position to determine whether any distribution will be in 
excess of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and 
profits as computed for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, 
it is expected that amounts distributed will be reported to the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as dividends.

Subject to applicable limitations, dividends paid to certain 
non-corporate US holders will be taxable at the preferential rates 
applicable to long-term capital gain if the dividends constitute 
‘qualified dividend income’. The Company expects that dividends 
paid by the Company with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs 
will constitute qualified dividend income. Non-corporate US holders 
should consult their own tax advisers to determine whether they are 
subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at these 
preferential rates.

Dividends must be included in income when the US holder, in the 
case of shares, or the ADR Depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually 
or constructively receives the dividend, and will not be eligible for 
the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US 
corporations in respect of dividends received from other US 
corporations. For foreign tax credit limitation purposes, dividends 
will generally be income from sources outside the US.

The amount of any dividend paid in pounds sterling will be the US 
dollar value of the sterling payments made, determined at the spot 
sterling/US dollar rate on the date the dividend distribution is 
includible in income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact 
converted into US dollars. If the dividend is converted into US dollars 
on that date, a US holder should not be required to recognise foreign 
currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income. Generally, 
any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations 
during the period from the date the dividend payment is includible 
in income to the date the payment is converted into US dollars will 
be treated as ordinary income or loss from sources within the US.

Taxation of capital gains
UK taxation
A US holder who is not resident for UK tax purposes in the UK 
and who is not trading in the UK will not generally be liable for UK 
taxation on capital gains, or eligible for relief for allowable losses, 
realised or accrued on the sale or other disposal of ADSs or ordinary 
shares. A US holder of ADSs or ordinary shares who is an individual 
and who, broadly, has temporarily ceased to be resident in the UK or 
has become temporarily treated as non-resident for UK tax purposes 
for a period of not more than five years and who disposes of ordinary 
shares or ADSs during that period may, for the year of assessment 
when that individual becomes resident again in the UK, be liable to 
UK tax on capital gains (subject to any available exemption or relief), 
notwithstanding the fact that such US holder was not treated as 
resident in the UK at the time of the sale or other disposal.

US federal income taxation
A US holder who sells or otherwise disposes of ordinary shares or 
ADSs will recognise a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax 
purposes equal to the difference between the amount realised and 
its tax basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs, each determined in US 
dollars. Such capital gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain or 
loss where the US holder has a holding period greater than one year. 
Losses may also be treated as long-term capital losses to the extent 
of certain ‘extraordinary dividends’ that qualified for the preferential 
tax rates on qualified dividend income described above. The capital 
gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the 
US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of 
capital losses is subject to limitations.

PFIC rules
Based on the manner in which the Group operates its business 
and estimates of the value of its assets (which estimates are based, 
in part, on the market value of the Company’s ADSs) the Company 
believes that it was not a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes 
for its 2023 taxable year. However, the Company’s PFIC status is an 
annual factual determination and thus may be subject to change. 
If the Company were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a US 
holder owned ordinary shares or ADSs, gain realised on the sale or 
other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would, in general, not 
be treated as capital gain. Instead, gain would be treated as if the US 
holder had realised such gain rateably over the holding period for 
the ordinary shares or ADSs and, to the extent allocated to the 
taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any year before 
the Company became a PFIC, would be taxed as ordinary income. 
The amount allocated to each other taxable year would be taxed 
at the highest tax rate in effect (for individuals or corporations, as 
applicable) for each such year to which the gain was allocated, 
together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to 
each such year. In addition, similar rules would apply to any ‘excess 
distribution’ received on the ordinary shares or ADSs (generally, the 
excess of distributions received on the ordinary shares or ADSs 
during the taxable year over 125% of the average amount of 
distributions received during a specified prior period). The preferential 
rates for qualified dividend income described above would not apply 
if the Company were a PFIC for the taxable year of the distribution or 
the preceding taxable year.

Certain elections may be available (including a market-to-market 
election) to US holders that would result in alternative treatments 
of the ordinary shares or ADSs. If the Company were a PFIC for any 
taxable year in which a US holder held ordinary shares or ADSs, a US 
holder would generally be required to file IRS Form 8621 with their 
annual US federal income tax returns, subject to certain exceptions.

Additional tax considerations
UK inheritance tax
An individual who is neither domiciled nor deemed domiciled in 
the UK is only chargeable to UK inheritance tax to the extent the 
individual owns assets situated in the UK. As a matter of UK law, 
it is not clear whether the situs of an ADS for UK inheritance tax 
purposes is determined by the place where the depositary is 
established and records the entitlements of the deposit holders, 
or by the situs of the underlying share which the ADS represents, 
but HMRC may take the view that the ADSs, as well as the ordinary 
shares, are or represent UK-situs assets.

However, an individual who is domiciled in the US (for the purposes 
of the Estate and Gift Tax Convention (the Convention)), and is not 
a UK national as defined in the Convention, will not be subject to UK 
inheritance tax (to the extent UK inheritance tax applies) in respect 
of the ordinary shares or ADSs on the individual’s death or on a 
transfer of the ordinary shares or ADSs during their lifetime, provided 
that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax is paid, unless the 
ordinary shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a UK 
permanent establishment or pertain to a UK fixed base of an 
individual used for the performance of independent personal 
services. Where the ordinary shares or ADSs have been placed in 
trust by a settlor, they may be subject to UK inheritance tax unless, 
when the trust was created, the settlor was domiciled in the US and 
was not a UK national. If no relief is given under the Convention, 
inheritance tax may be charged on death and also on the amount by 
which the value of an individual’s estate is reduced as a result of any 
transfer made by way of gift or other undervalue transfer, broadly 
within seven years of death, and in certain other circumstances. 
Where the ordinary shares or ADSs are subject to both UK 
inheritance tax and to US federal gift or estate tax, the Convention 
generally provides for either a credit against US federal tax liabilities 
for UK inheritance tax paid or for a credit against UK inheritance tax 
liabilities for US federal tax paid, as the case may be.

UK stamp duty and SDRT
Neither stamp duty nor Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) will 
generally be payable in the UK on the purchase or transfer of an 
ADS, provided that the ADS and any separate instrument or written 
agreement of transfer are executed and remain at all times outside 
the UK. UK legislation does however provide for stamp duty or 
SDRT to be payable at the rate of 1.5% on the amount or value of the 
consideration (or, in some cases, the value of the ordinary shares) 
where ordinary shares are transferred to a person (or a nominee or 
agent of a person) whose business is or includes issuing depositary 
receipts or the provision of clearance services. In accordance with 
the terms of the deposit agreement, any tax or duty payable on 
deposits of ordinary shares by the depositary or by the custodian of 
the depositary will typically be charged to the party to whom ADSs 
are delivered against such deposits. However, such transfers will not 
attract stamp duty or SDRT where they satisfy the conditions of an 
exemption, including exemptions which can apply to certain capital 
raising or qualifying listing arrangements.

The discussion above assumes that the provisions affecting stamp 
duty and SDRT contained in the Finance Bill currently proceeding 
through the UK Parliament (which, broadly, provide for the repeal 
of certain 1.5% SDRT charges on the issue of securities by a UK 
company to depositary receipt issuers and clearance services 
and the exemptions mentioned above which can apply to certain 
transfers of securities made in the course of capital raising or 
qualifying listing arrangements) are enacted in substantively the 
same form as currently published and have retroactive effect from 
1 January 2024. Until the Finance Bill receives Royal Assent (which 
is likely to be later in 2024), relevant provisions affecting stamp duty 
and SDRT have been given provisional statutory effect, as if they 
were contained in an Act of Parliament, under (in the case of SDRT) 
the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 and (in the case of 
stamp duty) the Finance Act 1973, through resolutions of the

House of Commons passed on 27 November 2023. Specific 
professional advice should be sought before paying a 1.5% SDRT 
or stamp duty charge in any circumstances.

A transfer of the underlying ordinary shares will generally be subject 
to stamp duty or SDRT, normally at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or 
value of the consideration (rounded up to the next multiple of £5 in 
the case of stamp duty). A transfer of ordinary shares from a nominee 
to its beneficial owner, including the transfer of underlying ordinary 
shares from the depositary to an ADS holder, under which no 
beneficial interest passes, will not be subject to stamp duty or SDRT.

Any UK stamp duty or SDRT imposed upon transfers of ADSs or 
ordinary shares will not be creditable for US federal income tax 
purposes. US Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding 
whether any such UK stamp duty or SDRT may be deductible or 
reduce the amount of gain (or increase the amount of loss) recognised 
upon a sale or other disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares.

US backup withholding and information reporting
Payments of dividends and sales proceeds with respect to ADSs 
and ordinary shares may be reported to the IRS and to the US holder. 
Backup withholding may apply to these reportable payments if the 
US holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number 
or certification of exempt status, or fails to report all interest and 
dividends required to be shown on its US federal income tax returns. 
Certain US holders (including, among others, corporations) are 
not subject to information reporting and backup withholding. 
The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a US 
holder will be allowed as a credit against the holder’s US federal 
income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided 
that the required information is furnished in a timely manner to the 
IRS. US holders should consult their tax advisers as to their 
qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the 
procedure for obtaining an exemption.

Certain US holders who are individuals (and certain specified entities), 
may be required to report information relating to their ownership 
of non-US securities unless the securities are held in accounts at 
financial institutions (in which case the accounts may be reportable 
if maintained by non-US financial institutions). US holders should 
consult their tax advisers regarding any reporting obligations they 
may have with respect to the Company’s ordinary shares or ADSs.

Disclosure controls and procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Group carried 
out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation 
of the Group’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and 
operation of the Group’s disclosure controls and procedures 
(as defined in Rules 13a–15(e) and 15d–15(e) of the Securities 
Exchange Act 1934).

These are defined as those controls and procedures designed to 
ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed 
under the Securities Exchange Act 1934 is recorded, processed, 
summarised and reported within the specified periods. Based on 
that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer concluded that the Group’s disclosure controls and 
procedures were effective.

Summary of significant corporate governance 
differences from NYSE listing standards
The Group’s statement of compliance with the principles and 
provisions specified in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 
July 2018 by the Financial Reporting Council (the Code) is set out on 
pages 141 and 142.

Non-Executive Director meetings
NYSE rules require that non-management Directors of US companies 
must meet on a regular basis without management present, and 
independent Directors must meet separately at least once per year. 
The Code recommends: (i) the Board Chair to hold meetings with 
the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present; 
and (ii) the Non-Executive Directors to meet at least annually without 
the Chair present to appraise the Chair’s performance. The Company’s 
Non-Executive Directors have met frequently without Executive 
Directors being present, and intend to continue this practice, after 
every Board meeting if possible.

Shareholder approval of equity compensation plans
The NYSE rules require that shareholders must be given the 
opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material 
revisions to those plans. The Company complies with UK 
requirements, which are similar to the NYSE rules. The Board does 
not, however, explicitly take into consideration the NYSE’s detailed 
definition of ‘material revisions’.

Code of Conduct
The NYSE requires companies to adopt a code of business 
conduct and ethics, applicable to Directors, officers and employees. 
Any waivers granted to Directors or officers under such a code must 
be promptly disclosed. As set out on pages 39 and 40, IHG’s Code 
of Conduct is applicable to all Directors, officers and employees, and 
is available on the Company’s website at ihgplc.com/corporate-
governance/code-of-conduct. No waivers have been granted 
under the Code of Conduct.

Compliance certification
Each chief executive of a US company must certify to the NYSE each 
year that he or she is not aware of any violation by the Company of 
any NYSE corporate governance listing standard. As the Company is 
a foreign private issuer, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer is not 
required to make this certification. However, he is required to notify 
the NYSE promptly in writing after any of the Company’s executive 
officers become aware of any non-compliance with those NYSE 
corporate governance rules applicable to the Company.

IHG has also adopted the corporate governance requirements of 
the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and of the NYSE, to the 
extent that they are applicable to it as a foreign private issuer. As a 
foreign private issuer, IHG is required to disclose any significant 
ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those 
followed by US companies. These are as follows:

Basis of regulation
The Code contains a series of principles and provisions. Listed 
companies are required to state how they have applied the Code’s 
principles, and the provisions operate on a ‘comply or explain’ basis, 
where any areas of non-compliance should be disclosed with an 
explanation for the non-compliance. 

In contrast, US companies listed on the NYSE are required to adopt 
and disclose corporate governance guidelines adopted by the NYSE.

Independent Directors
The Code’s principles recommend that at least half the Board, 
excluding the Chair, should consist of independent non-executive 
directors. As at 16 February 2024, the Board consisted of the Chair, 
independent at the time of her appointment, two Executive Directors 
and eight independent Non-Executive Directors. NYSE listing rules 
applicable to US companies state that companies must have a 
majority of independent directors. The NYSE has set out six bright 
line tests for director independence. The Board’s judgement is that 
all of its Non-Executive Directors are independent. However, it did 
not explicitly take into consideration the NYSE’s tests in reaching 
this determination.

Chair and Chief Executive Officer
The Code recommends that the Chair and Chief Executive Officer 
should not be the same individual to ensure that there is a clear 
division of responsibility for the running of the Company’s business. 
There is no corresponding requirement for US companies. The roles 
of Chair and Chief Executive Officer were, as at 16 February 2024 
and throughout 2023, fulfilled by separate individuals.

Committees
The Company has a number of Board Committees which are similar 
in purpose and constitution to those required for domestic companies 
under NYSE rules. The NYSE requires US companies to have audit, 
remuneration and nominating/corporate governance committees 
composed entirely of independent directors, as defined under the 
NYSE rules. The Company’s Nomination, Audit and Remuneration 
Committees consist entirely of Non-Executive Directors who are 
independent under the standards of the Code, which may not 
necessarily be the same as the NYSE independence standards. 
The nominating/governance committee is responsible for identifying 
individuals qualified to become Board members and to recommend 
to the Board a set of corporate governance principles. As the Company 
is subject to the Code, the Company’s Nomination Committee is 
responsible for nominating, for approval by the Board, candidates 
for appointment to the Board, including recommending suitable 
candidates for the role of Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director. The Company’s Nomination Committee consists of the 
Chair and independent Non-Executive Directors.

The Chair of the Company is not a member of the Audit Committee. 
As set out on page 94, the Audit Committee is chaired by an 
independent Non-Executive Director who, in the Board’s view, has 
the experience and qualifications to satisfy the criterion under US 
rules for an ‘audit committee financial expert’.

Total

The geographical profile presented is based on an analysis of shareholders (by manager) of 10,000 shares or above where geographical 
ownership is known. This analysis only captures 93% of total issued share capital. Therefore, the known percentage distributions have been 
multiplied by 100/93 to achieve the figures shown in the table above.

As of 16 February 2024, 13,057,667 ADRs equivalent to 13,057,667 ordinary shares, or approximately 7.58% of the total issued share capital, 
were outstanding and were held by 405 holders. Since certain ordinary shares are registered in the names of nominees, the number of 
shareholders on record may not be representative of the number of beneficial owners.

As of 16 February 2024, there were a total of 30,018 recorded holders of ordinary shares, of whom 228 had registered addresses in the US 
and held a total of 275,706 ordinary shares (0.16% of the total issued share capital).

Forward-looking statements

The Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023 contains certain forward-
looking statements as defined under US legislation (Section 21E of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to the financial 
condition, results of operations and business of the Group and certain 
plans and objectives of the Board of Directors of InterContinental 
Hotels Group PLC with respect thereto. Such statements include, 
but are not limited to, statements made in the Chair’s statement 
and in the Chief Executive Officer’s review. These forward-looking 
statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only 
to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use 
words such as ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, ‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘intend’, ‘plan’, 
‘goal’, ‘believe’, or other words of similar meaning. These statements 
are based on assumptions and assessments made by the Group’s 
management in light of their experience and their perception of 
historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments 
and other factors they believe to be appropriate.

By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, 
speculative and involve risk and uncertainty. There are a number of 
factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ 
materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-
looking statements, including, but not limited to: the Group’s 
exposure to a competitive and changing industry; the Group’s 
reliance on the reputation of its existing brands and exposure 
to inherent reputation risks; the Group’s exposure to inherent 
uncertainties associated with brand development and expansion; 
the Group’s exposure to a variety of risks related to identifying, 
securing and retaining franchise and management agreements; 
the Group’s exposure to the risks of hotel industry overcapacity; 
the Group’s requirement to have the right people, skills and 
capability to manage growth and change; the risk that the Group’s 
collective bargaining activity could disrupt operations, increase 
labour costs or interfere with the ability of management to focus on 
executing business strategies; the Group’s exposure to cybersecurity 
and data privacy risks; the Group’s exposure to intellectual property 
risks; the risk that the Group’s reputation and the value of its brands 
are influenced by the perception of various stakeholders of the Group; 
the Group’s requirements to comply with existing and changing 
regulations and act in accordance with societal expectations across 
numerous countries, territories and jurisdictions; the Group’s 

exposure to the risk of litigation; the potential for domestic and 
international environmental laws and regulations to cause the Group 
to incur substantial costs or subject the Group to potential liabilities; 
the Group’s financial performance being affected by changes in 
tax laws; the Group’s dependence on a wide range of external 
stakeholders and business partners; the Group’s exposure to a variety 
of risks associated with safety, security and crisis management; the 
Group’s reliance on the resilience of its reservation system and other 
key technology platforms and the exposure to risks that could disrupt 
their operation and/or integrity; the Group’s exposure to political 
and economic developments; the Group’s exposure to continued 
disruption and consequences from the war in Ukraine; the Group’s 
exposure to disruption and consequences from the conflict in the 
Middle East; the potential for the Group to face difficulties insuring 
its business; the Group’s exposure to risks related to executing and 
realising benefits from strategic transactions, including acquisitions 
and restructuring; the Group’s exposure to a variety of risks 
associated with its financial stability and ability to borrow and satisfy 
debt covenants; the dependence of the Group’s operations on 
maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet all foreseeable medium-term 
requirements and provide headroom against unforeseen obligations; 
the Group’s exposure to an impairment of the carrying value of its 
brands, goodwill or other tangible and intangible assets negatively 
affecting its consolidated operating results; the Group’s exposure to 
fluctuations in exchange rates, currency devaluations or restructurings 
and to interest rate risk in relation to its borrowings; the potential for 
the Group to be affected by credit risk on treasury transactions; the 
Group’s exposure to inherent risks in relation to changing technology 
and systems; the Group’s exposure to competition from online travel 
agents and intermediaries; the Group’s exposure to the risk of events 
or stakeholder expectations that adversely impact domestic or 
international travel, including climate change; and the Group’s 
exposure to risks relating to its commitments in relation to 
climate change. 

The main factors that could affect the business and financial results 
are described in the Strategic Report of the Annual Report and 
Form 20-F 2023.
