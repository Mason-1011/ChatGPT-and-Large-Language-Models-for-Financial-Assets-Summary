Adjusted free cash flow

LT

KPI

Adjusted free cash flow is net cash from operating activities adjusted for: (1) the inclusion of the cash 
outflow arising from the purchase of shares by employee share trusts reflecting the requirement to 
satisfy incentive schemes which are linked to operating performance; (2) the inclusion of maintenance 
capital expenditure (excluding contract acquisition costs); (3) the inclusion of the principal element of 
lease payments; and (4) the exclusion of payments of deferred or contingent purchase consideration 
included within net cash from operating activities.

Management believes adjusted free cash flow is a useful measure for investors and other stakeholders 
as it represents the cash available to invest back into the business to drive future growth and pay the 
ordinary dividend, with any surplus being available for additional returns to shareholders.

Changes in definitions to the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts
The following definitions have been amended:

•  The definition and calculation of Total Gross Revenue has been amended to include revenue from exclusive partner hotels, as this revenue 
reflects the value that IHG generates for its exclusive partner hotels. The value of Total Gross Revenue is unchanged in comparative years.

•  Underlying fee revenue and operating profit measures have been amended to separate revenue and related costs from insurance 
activities from fee business revenue and costs. This change is due to the adoption of IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’, which requires 
insurance related revenue and costs to be disclosed separately from fee revenues. Underlying fee revenue and operating profit measures 
have also been amended. Comparative periods have been restated for this change.

•  The definition and reconciliation of fee margin has been amended to remove the exclusion of insurance revenues and costs, as insurance 
related revenues and costs are no longer included as part of fee business (see above). Where information is available, comparative periods 
have been re-presented for this change.

•  The adjusted tax definition has been amended to align to the adjustments made to adjusted earnings per share to ensure consistency 

between measures. Fair value gains/losses on contingent consideration and System Fund interest are therefore now excluded from the 
calculation of adjusted tax. The measure has been restated for prior years to show consistent presentation.

   The performance review should be read in conjunction with the Non-GAAP reconciliations on pages 226 to 231 and the Glossary on pages 267 to 268.

Governance

Chair’s overview

The Board seeks 
to ensure that 
IHG’s culture and 
governance promote 
the Group’s long-term 
success and deliver 
sustainable value for 
our shareholders.”

45%

Women on IHG’s Board

IHG Directors from a 
minority ethnic background

During 2023, the Board sought to build on the Group’s 

strong foundation and culture of governance and to gain 
a deeper understanding of the trends and factors affecting 
the long-term sustainable success, resilience and future prospects 
of the Group. 

The Board strives to enhance an environment of transparency 
and accountability, to ensure that reliable governance frameworks 
and processes are maintained, while encouraging an approach to 
decision-making that facilitates the Group’s strategic priorities in 
a constantly evolving geopolitical and regulatory environment. 

Across the year, the Board maintained a high level of engagement 
and interaction with the Group’s stakeholders. Extensive shareholder 
consultation was undertaken by the Board, particularly in relation 
to the approach to remuneration and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy approved during the year. 

The Board also enjoyed continued constructive engagement with 
owners and colleagues throughout the year. For example, I was 
pleased to spend time meeting with the CEO of the IHG Owners 
Association, which provided valuable insight into the perspectives 
of our owners on the Group’s strategic initiatives. I also enjoyed 
meeting and hearing directly from a number of colleagues as part 
of the Board’s Voice of the Employee engagement programme. 

Focus areas and activities 
The Board had another active year in 2023, and more information 
on its activities is given on pages 101 to 103. 

The Board oversaw the evolution of the Group’s strategy and 
endorsed the refinement of the Group’s ambition to focus on 
accelerating growth, as well as the enhancements to the strategic 
pillars and the new growth behaviours. 

The Board actively engaged with the Group’s growth agenda, 
supporting and approving the launch of the Garner brand. 

The Board was further pleased to support the Group’s creation 
of value for shareholders by approving the $750m share buyback 
programme announced and completed during the year as well as 
the regular dividend payments. 

Cybersecurity was again a significant area of focus for the Board. 
The Board discussed the broad nature of cyber risk with external 
specialists, including emerging risk areas, such as the rise of AI, 
and the approach to prioritising mitigating initiatives. The Board also 
monitored throughout the year the Group’s approach to cyber risk 
and the increased investment in security measures, as well as the 
culture of security awareness and the approach to training across 
the organisation. 

Board composition
During the year, we also saw the successful execution of Board 
succession planning with changes at both the Executive and 
Non-Executive levels. At the Executive level, Elie Maalouf and 
Michael Glover succeeded Keith Barr and Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson 
as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer respectively.

At the Non-Executive level, in the first half of the year, as previously 
announced, Graham Allan and Byron Grote transitioned to become 
Chair of the Responsible Business Committee and Chair of the Audit 
Committee respectively.

The execution of succession planning continued with Angie Risley 
joining the Board in September and succeeding Jo Harlow as Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee from 1 January 2024, following Jo’s 
retirement from the Board. We also announced the appointment of 
Ron Kalifa as Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 January 2024. 
Further information on Board appointments during the year can be 
found in the Nomination Committee Report on page 115.

I would again like to express my and the Board’s sincere gratitude 
to Keith, Paul and Jo for their contribution to IHG.

Compliance and our dual listing
IHG continues to operate as a dual-listed company with a premium 
listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the 
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Under the UK listing rules, we are 
obliged to make a statement as to how we have applied the principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). Under the NYSE 
listing rules, as a foreign private issuer, we are required to disclose 
any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices 
differ from those of US companies. To ensure consistency of 
information provided to both UK and US investors, we produce 
a combined Annual Report and Form 20-F. 

Our Statement of compliance with the Code is on pages 141 and 142. 
A summary outlining the differences between the Group’s UK 
corporate governance practices and those followed by US 
companies can be found on page 258. 

Looking forward
In 2024, the Board will focus on the outcomes of the external 
evaluation completed in 2023 and the delivery of the Group’s 
strategic objectives, while ensuring that the integrity of the 
Group’s governance framework is maintained.

Deanna Oppenheimer
Chair of the Board
19 February 2024

I am also proud to report that at the end of 2023, our Board 
continues to exceed the FTSE 100 Women Leaders Review target 
for women on a FTSE 100 Board. With regard to the Parker Review 
(the FTSE 350 Ethnic Diversity Submission), IHG continues to 
exceed the original target set by the Review of at least one director 
from an ethnically diverse background, with four ethnically diverse 
directors. Likewise, IHG has set targets for ethnic diversity in relation 
to senior management. Further detail and reporting on these targets 
can be found on pages 30 and 31. 

Committee activities
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to its Committees to 
assist in ensuring effective corporate governance across the business. 
During 2023: 

•  the Audit Committee focused on monitoring the Group’s risk 
management and internal controls systems (see its report on 
pages 107 to 111);

•  the Remuneration Committee focused on developments in relation 
to incentive plans, including approval of the Deferred Award Plan 
rules and the inclusion of ESG metrics in the Long Term Incentive 
Plan (see its report on pages 116 to 140);

•  the Responsible Business Committee focused on progress 

against the 2023 responsible business priorities, which support 
the Company’s Journey to Tomorrow responsible business plan 
(see its report on pages 112 and 113); and

•  the Nomination Committee focused on the execution of Board 
and Committee succession plans and the external evaluation 
(see its report on pages 114 and 115).

Further detail on the Group’s governance structure is given on 
page 100.

Board performance review 
During the year, an external review of the effectiveness of the Board 
and its Committees was undertaken. I am pleased to report that 
overall the review supported the positive conclusions of the Board 
and its Committees as to their effectiveness. Further details of the 
external evaluation can be found on pages 104 to 106. Individual 
director feedback assessments were also conducted, details of 
which can be found on page 106.

wide-ranging discussion with concrete outcomes, oriented around a relentless focus on growth, a strong commercial engine and 
a high-performance culture. Outcomes and action items were also addressed at subsequent Board meetings.

Board members also had the opportunity to engage informally with colleagues from our Atlanta office.

  See pages 36 and 37 for information about how we have engaged with our stakeholders in 2023. Further details of our regard for our people, communities 
and the planet are on page 3 and pages 28 to 35.

Board activities continued
Our shareholders and investors

During 2023, IHG continued its open dialogue with shareholders 
and investors and conducted its annual programme of investor 
relations activities with support from its brokers and advisers. 
The Board received regular updates and considered feedback 
as outlined on page 101. In addition, our Registrar and American 
Depositary Receipts (ADR) programme custodians have supported 
shareholders and ADR holders with their queries. 

Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
The Board was pleased to meet shareholders in person at the 
2023 AGM.

Our 2024 AGM will be held on Friday 3 May 2024. The notice of 
meeting will be sent to shareholders and made available on our 
website in due course.

Committee Chairs and the Senior Independent Director are available 
for shareholders if they have concerns they wish to discuss. 

  Visit ihgplc.com/investors under Shareholder centre.

  Further information on the Board’s engagement with shareholders 
and investors is included on page 36.

Director appointments and induction

Director appointments 
Details of the appointments to the Board made during 2023 are 
described in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 114 and 115. 

•  Arthur de Haast as a member of the Audit Committee 

of Chalet Hotels Limited.

•  Byron Grote as Interim Chair of Tesco PLC.

New Director inductions 
Upon appointment, all new Directors undergo a comprehensive and 
formal induction programme that is tailored to meet their individual 
needs and respective roles on the Board. We believe this is crucial 
to ensure our Directors have a full understanding of all aspects of 
our business and familiarity with the Group’s purpose, culture and 
values to ensure they can contribute effectively to the Board.

For Michael Glover, a bespoke induction plan focused on his transition 
to an Executive Director and Executive Committee role was prepared, 
with a particular focus on his responsibilities as CFO. His induction 
included meetings with key external advisers and stakeholders and 
an overview of corporate governance requirements in relation to his 
responsibilities as an Executive Director. 

Given Elie Maalouf’s longstanding role on the Board and Executive 
Committee, following his appointment as CEO, a targeted transition 
plan was put in place focusing on aspects specific to his role as 
CEO, with a particular emphasis on key investor, colleague, owner, 
media and industry relationships.

For Angie Risley and Ron Kalifa, tailored induction plans were prepared 
in advance of their appointment to the Board. Their plans broadly 
covered the following topics, while being tailored to their Committee 
appointments and roles, with a particular emphasis on understanding 
IHG’s business, long-term strategy, risks and opportunities within 
the business and governance processes and controls:

•  Jo Harlow as Senior Independent Director of Halma PLC.

•  Elie Maalouf as a member of the World Travel & Tourism Council’s 

Executive Committee.

In each case, the Board took into account other appointments, the 
time commitment required for each role and the context of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, including institutional investor and 
proxy adviser guidelines concerning over-boarding. It was concluded 
that the additional appointments should not adversely impact their 
performance but should enhance their ability to provide 
constructive challenge and strategic guidance. 

Ongoing Director training and development
We understand the importance of an ongoing training programme 
for Directors to enable them to fully understand the Group’s business 
and operations in the context of the rapidly developing environment 
in which it operates. The Chair regularly reviews the training and 
development needs with each Director and the Board is made aware 
of training opportunities.

Board and Committee meetings are regularly used to update 
Directors on developments in the environment in which the business 
operates and in-depth presentations are provided on key topical 
areas. In 2023, these sessions included updates on assurance and 
governance matters; perspectives in relation to corporate philanthropy 
and community investment; and market updates in relation to 
remuneration and pensions.

•  information on the Group’s purpose, culture, values and strategy, 
including its business model, brands and the markets in which 
it operates;

In addition, the Company Secretary provides regular updates on 
regulatory, corporate governance and legal matters, and Directors 
are able to meet individually with senior management if necessary.

•  key strategic initiatives;

•  our approach to internal controls and our risk management strategy; 

•  information on the Board, its Committees and IHG’s governance 

processes;

•  a reminder of the rules relating to maintaining the confidentiality of 
inside information and restrictions in dealing in IHG shares, together 
with a briefing on the policies and procedures IHG has in place to 
ensure compliance with such rules; and

•  meetings with members of the Board and the Executive Committee, 
senior management from functions across the Group, the external 
Auditor and other key external advisers.

Additional appointments 
During 2023, the Board considered and endorsed the following 
additional appointments of Directors:

•  Graham Allan as Chair of the Remuneration Committee 

of Associated British Foods PLC.

External evaluation
In line with best practice, each year, the performance and 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees are carefully 
reviewed through a formal evaluation process, which is traditionally 
facilitated externally every three years. An external evaluation was 
last completed in 2019, with internal evaluations completed in 2020, 
2021 and 2022 following agreement to defer an external evaluation 
to 2023 due to the recent appointment of the Chair in 2022.

In 2023, an external evaluation was undertaken and conducted 
by Independent Audit Limited (‘IA’), following a comprehensive 
evaluation of several providers. IA has no prior connection with the 
Company or any of its Directors, with the exception of conducting 
an external review for Hargreaves Lansdown PLC in 2021, a company 
on which the Chair has previously served as a director.

An outline of the evaluation process and details of the results of the 
review are set out on the following pages.

Preparation

Following a review 
of several external 
board evaluation 
providers, IA was 
commissioned 
to facilitate the 
evaluation of 
the Board and 
its Committees.

Questionnaires for 
the Board and four 
Committees were 
prepared by IA in 
discussion with the 
Company Secretary 
and the Chair and 
agreed by each 
Committee Chair.

Review of Board 
papers and meeting 
observation 

A review of Board 
papers and the 
observation of 
meetings of the 
Board and of the 
Audit, Nomination, 
and Responsible 
Business Committees 
was conducted by IA.

Completion of 
questionnaires and 
follow – up 
interviews 

The Board 
questionnaires were 
completed by all 
Board members, the 
Company Secretary 
and relevant 
members of senior 
management and 
follow-up interviews 
with each member 
of the Board and 
Company Secretary 
were conducted. 

Reporting

IA analysed the 
results and complied 
a report for the  
Board and each 
Committee which  
was discussed in 
draft with the Chair 
and Company 
Secretary and 
presented to the 
Board and each  
of the Committees  
for discussion  
and consideration. 
IA invited Board 
members to follow up 
individually if desired.

Results of Governance Review

Strengths:

The results of IA’s external review noted 
several strengths:

1)   The Board’s composition is comprised 
of a good mix of skills, experience, and 
personalities that work well with each other 
and management. 

2)  New Board members have brought a 

high degree of openness and willingness 
to engage. 

3)  Engagement has been open and 

transparent, and Board members are able 
to contribute to productive debate in the 
decision-making process.

Areas of focus for the year ahead:

1)   Consideration of the ‘Big Trends’: 

continued consideration of industry trends 
and dynamics, including ever-changing 
customer needs and expectations and 
competitor actions.

2)   Executive succession planning: following 
both CEO and CFO succession, looking to 
the capabilities, skills, diversity and 
characteristics needed for the future, 
focusing on Executive succession planning 
and strengthening the Board’s relationship 
with recently promoted senior 
management.

3)   Risk, technology & ESG: given the 

dynamic external environment, continued 
focus on IHG’s overarching Risk 
Management Framework, emerging 
technologies and the wider ESG landscape.

Board Committees
The external evaluation process also assessed the effectiveness 
and support provided by and to the Board Committees. Through the 
process, it was confirmed that they have the necessary attributes to 
support their effective operation and that the Committees are well 
integrated into the Board decision-making processes. Each of the 

Committees reviewed the findings and agreed the respective 
actions with consideration of the overall Board findings where they 
were deemed relevant to the Committee’s work. Further details are 
set out in each Committee Report on pages 107, 112, 115 and 125.

Performance evaluation of Directors

In addition to the external Board evaluation process outlined 
above, the Chair assessed the individual performance of the 
Non-Executive Directors and carried out one-to-one meetings 
with each of them, focusing on their contribution to the Board 
and Principal Committees and engagement with fellow 
Directors, taking into account their relevant skills, knowledge 
and experience. Particular points of note were shared with the 
individual Directors and overall, the Chair concluded that the 
Directors perform their duties independently and effectively 
and that they dedicate sufficient time to discharge their 
Board responsibilities. 

The performance assessment of the Chair was led by the SID. 
The evaluation focused on: 

•  overall leadership of the Board; 

•  the Board’s culture and the Chair’s ability to facilitate 

constructive Board relations; and 

•  managing the Board in accordance with high standards 

of corporate governance. 

The CEO evaluation was led by the Chair, who collected 
feedback to a series of questions from the Non-Executive 
Directors. Key areas of focus included: 

•  the Group’s performance and impact of the CEO; 

•  the relationship and ability to work collaboratively 

and transparently with the Board; 

•  delivery of the Group’s growth agenda; 

•  regard for community and the environment; 

•  building talent and organisational capabilities; and 

•  progress in relation to IHG’s 2023 plan and future 

strategic priorities.

Key duties and role of the Committee
Key objectives and summary of responsibilities
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that IHG maintains 
a strong control environment. It monitors the integrity of IHG’s 
financial reporting, including significant financial reporting 
judgements; maintains oversight and reviews our systems of internal 
control and risk management; monitors and reviews the effectiveness 
and performance of internal and external audit functions; and reviews 
the behaviours expected of IHG’s employees through the Code of 
Conduct and related policies. 

The Committee’s role, responsibilities and authority delegated to it 
by the Board are set out in its Terms of Reference (ToR), which are 
reviewed annually and approved by the Board. 

  The ToR are available at ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate governance.

As noted, the Committee focused its attention on reviewing and 
obtaining assurance in relation to emerging and evolving risks as 
well as the Group Financial Statements and controls. Key areas 
of focus over the year have been:

•  the evolution of the Group’s financial governance programme, 
including streamlining processes and automation of controls;

•  internal controls and assurance in connection with the Group’s 

HR system transition and Iberostar integration;

•  the Group’s approach to managing on-going compliance risks, 
including in relation to hotel operational safety and security, 
supply chain, data privacy and ethics and compliance.

Membership and attendance at meetings
Details of the Committee’s membership and attendance at meetings 
are set out on page 96. The Chair of the Board, CEO, CFO, Group 
Financial Controller, Head of Risk and Assurance, Deputy Company 
Secretary and our external Auditor attended all meetings in 2023. 
The General Counsel and Company Secretary also normally attends 
all meetings and in 2023, attended all but one of the meetings. 
Other attendees are invited to meetings as appropriate and the CEO 
and all other Directors were invited to Committee meetings where 
the approval of financial reporting was considered and discussed. 
The Committee continues to hold private sessions with the internal 
and external Auditors without the presence of management to 
ensure that a culture of transparency is maintained. 

The Committee Chair continues to have recent and relevant 
financial experience and all members of the Committee are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. In accordance with the Code, 
the Board also considers that the Committee as a whole possesses 
competence relevant to the Company’s sector, having a range of 
financial and commercial experience in the hospitality industry and 
the broader commercial environment in which the Group operates. 
Further details of the skills and experience of the Committee 
members can be found on pages 93 to 95.

Reporting to the Board
Following each Committee meeting, the Committee Chair updates 
the Board on key issues discussed. The papers and minutes for each 
meeting are circulated to all Board members, who are invited to 
request further information if required and to provide any challenge 
where necessary. 

Effectiveness of the Committee
During the year, the Committee’s effectiveness was reviewed as part 
of the external Board evaluation process. The Committee concluded 
that it remains effective, focuses on the right issues and provides a 
good level of challenge. An area identified for future focus is further 
developing Committee papers to continue to enhance discussions.

Audit Committee Report

IHG  |  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Governance

Audit Committee Report continued

Focus areas and activities
Financial and narrative reporting
During the year, the Committee reviewed and recommended 
approval of the interim and annual Financial Statements 
(considering the relevant accounting and reporting matters such 
as key judgement areas, going concern and viability statements, 
the financial reporting impacts of commercial litigation and 
disputes, exceptional items and impairment reviews) and the 
Group’s quarterly trading updates. All members of the Board 
are asked to attend these meetings.

As well as receiving input and guidance from the external Auditor 
on the areas outlined above, the Committee also received regular 
reports from the Chair of the Disclosure Committee, which liaised 
closely with other external advisers of the Group to ensure that 
disclosure and regulatory requirements were being appropriately 
considered and met. Copies of the Disclosure Committee’s minutes 
were also provided to the Committee. 

The Committee received early drafts of the Annual Report and 
Form 20-F 2023 (Annual Report), and when providing comments 
considered: (i) the process for preparing and verifying the Annual 
Report, which included review by the Executive Committee and 
input from senior employees in the Company Secretariat, Legal, 
Operations, Strategy, Human Resources, Finance, Risk and 
Assurance teams; (ii) a report from the Chair of the Disclosure 
Committee; and (iii) a checklist prepared by the Annual Report team 
confirming compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements.

The Committee also considered management’s analysis of how the 
content, taken as a whole, was ‘fair, balanced and understandable’, 
and whether it contained the necessary information for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position, performance, business model and 
strategy. In order to reach this conclusion, a dedicated project 
team worked on the contents of the Annual Report and a detailed 
verification process to confirm the accuracy of the information 
contained within the Annual Report was undertaken by the Financial 
Planning and Analysis department. The Committee then considered 
both the structure and content of the Annual Report to ensure that 
the key messages were effectively and consistently communicated 
and that meaningful links between the business model, strategy, KPIs, 
principal risks and remuneration were clearly identified throughout 
the Annual Report. The Committee also considered the proportionate 
and consistent consideration of climate matters across the Annual 
Report, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) statement and an asset-by-asset review for 
impairment purposes.

Alongside this review, the Committee considered guidance provided 
by the FRC throughout the year, including in relation to the concept 
of an Audit and Assurance Policy within the proposed changes to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Company’s consultation 
response to the FRC on the proposal was reviewed by the Committee. 
The Committee also reviewed trends in ESG reporting requirements 
and considered governance and assurance implications. 

Following a review of the contents of the Annual Report alongside 
the aforementioned criteria, the Committee reported its 
recommendation to approve the Annual Report to the Board.

Significant matters in the 2023 Financial Statements
Throughout 2023, the Committee provided ongoing challenge 
to management’s accounting, reporting and internal controls. 
The Committee discussed with management and the external 
Auditor the significant areas of complexity, management judgement 
and estimation in relation to the Financial Statements, and the 
impact of any accounting developments or legislative changes. 
The Committee has satisfied itself that management had adequately 
identified and considered all potentially significant accounting and 
disclosure matters. The key items discussed are outlined on pages 
110 and 111.

Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for establishing procedures to manage 
risk, overseeing the internal control framework and determining 
the nature and extent of the principal risks the Company is willing 
to take to achieve its long-term objectives. The Committee supports 
the Board by reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems and assessing emerging and 
principal risks and undertook such a review in respect of 2023.

In order to effectively review the internal control and risk 
management systems, the Committee:

•  receives regular reports from management, the Risk and Assurance 
team and the external Auditor on the effectiveness of the systems 
for risk management and internal controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls;

•  reviews the process by which risks are identified (including 

procedures in place to identify emerging risks and linkage to wider 
consideration of strategy and resilience) and assesses the timeliness 
and effectiveness of action taken by management, including regular 
reports on the Company’s overall risk management and internal 
controls systems and principal risks; and

•  receives regular reports relevant to risk management and internal 
controls, both financial and non-financial, to ensure that current 
and emerging risks are identified and assessed and that there is 
an appropriate management response (see pages 42 to 49 for 
further detail on our risks and initiatives to manage them).

As part of the Committee’s review of the internal control and risk 
management systems, key financial, operational and compliance 
controls across the business continue to be monitored and tested 
throughout the year. The Committee assesses the approach to 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 (SOX) compliance in accordance with 
our US obligations and reviews reports on the progress of the SOX 
programme at each meeting. During the year, the Committee 
received updates on the delivery of the training programme for 
SOX control owners and the longer-term objective of reducing the 
overall control count.

During 2023, the Committee considered the activity undertaken by 
the Risk and Assurance team to review and refresh risk profiles and 
integrate resilience planning into the prioritisation and capability 
building of the Group’s business teams. The Committee also 
received updates on:

•  key assurance projects relating to the transition of the Group’s 

primary HR system and integration in respect of the 
Iberostar alliance;

•  supply chain risks and the strategy for mitigating uncertainties, 

noting the work of the Supply Chain Risk Council to drive awareness 
of emerging issues among relevant stakeholders and embedding 
risk management and internal control approaches in relation to 
supply chain; and

•  the Group’s approach to managing hotel operational safety and 
security risks, including the impact of conversion hotels and the 
development and integration of new business models such as 
branded residential and all-inclusive resorts on IHG’s operational 
safety and security framework.

Having reviewed the internal controls and risk management systems 
throughout the year, the Committee concluded that the Group 
continues to have an effective system of risk management and 
internal controls, and that there are no material weaknesses in the 
control environment.

Tax risks, policies and governance
The Group’s CFO has responsibility for tax and tax policies at Board 
level. These policies and procedures are subject to regular review 
and update and are approved by the Audit Committee. Procedures 
to minimise risk include the preparation of thorough tax risk 
assessments for all transactions carrying material tax risk and,

where appropriate, material tax uncertainties are discussed and 
resolved with tax authorities in advance.

  Our Approach to Tax document is available at 
ihgplc.com/en/responsible-business/policies-and-position-statements

Principal risk areas
During the year, the Committee discussed and assessed the range 
and aggregate impact of dynamic risks that the Group faced in the 
context of the ongoing volatility in the geopolitical and macroeconomic 
environment. Alongside the review of the overall portfolio of risks, 
the Committee requested and received updates on the following 
specific areas:

•  emerging risks in relation to the use and management of 

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) and the management by 
the business of both upside and downside risks relating to Gen AI;

•  physical and chronic climate risks to the hospitality sector; and

•  the approach to cross-border data transfers.

Further details of our principal risks, uncertainties and review 
process can be found on pages 42 to 49.

Non-audit services
IHG’s Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy helps to 
ensure that the external Auditor’s independence and objectivity are 
not impacted by non-audit services provided by the external Auditor. 
The policy is reviewed by the Audit Committee annually.

The policy requires that pre-approval is obtained from the Audit 
Committee for all services provided by the external Auditor before 
any work can commence, without any de minimis threshold in line 
with US SEC requirements and UK ethical standards. The Committee 
reviewed the audit and non-audit fees incurred with the external 
Auditor and noted that there had been no prohibited services 
(as defined by SOX or under UK ethical standards) provided to the 
Group during the year. The Committee is prohibited from delegating 
non-audit services approval to management and compliance with 
the policy is actively managed.

IHG is committed to maintaining non-audit fees at a low level and 
the Committee remains cognisant of the guidelines of investor 
advisory bodies on non-audit fees. During 2023, 10% of services 
provided to the Group were non-audit services (2022: 11%), primarily 
related to System and Organisation Controls (SOC) Reports. These 
services are typically performed by external auditors as knowledge 
of the Company or Group is necessary for the provision of the 
non-audit services. Details of the fees paid to PwC for non-audit and 
statutory audit work during 2023 can be found on page 178. The 
Committee is satisfied that the Company was compliant during the 
year with the FRC’s Ethical and Auditing Standards in respect of the 
scope and maximum permitted level of fees incurred for non-audit 
services provided by PwC. Where non-audit work is performed by 
PwC, both the Company and PwC ensure adherence to robust 
processes to prevent the objectivity and independence of the 
external Auditor being compromised.

Risk and assurance – Internal Audit
The Committee discusses and approves the Internal Audit annual 
plan, which aims to provide objective and insightful assurance that 
appropriate controls are in place to support our strategy and growth 
ambitions. Progress against the Internal Audit plan is reported at 
each meeting and, during 2023, the Committee reviewed several 
areas set out in the plan, including programme governance and 
oversight of expenditure and benefit delivery. 

The 2024 plan presented to the Committee in November 2023 
maintains focus on the integrity of the risk management and internal 
control system, providing independent assurance to complement 
management’s own activities where these are relatively mature, 
well governed and/or regulated. Areas of focus in 2024 include 
management of interdependencies between major technology 

programmes, control arrangements for data and information usage, 
storage and transfer and management’s preparedness for fast-
evolving legislation. 

Following consideration, the Committee confirmed its agreement 
to the 2024 Internal Audit plan, including the assurance objectives 
identified. The Committee reviews the results of completed audits 
and observations from other ongoing assurance and control 
improvement support, as well as actions taken by management 
in response to Internal Audit’s work.

The functional effectiveness of Internal Audit is assessed on an 
ongoing basis and reported to the Committee throughout the 
year. During 2023, this involved an independent external quality 
assessment of the function. The Committee reviewed and 
considered the conclusions of the external assessment, with 
particular focus on the future methodology and capabilities 
required for the function, including the use of external expertise.

Governance and compliance 
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Group’s Code 
of Conduct and related policies.

Looking forward
During 2024, the Committee will remain focused on the Group’s 
internal control and risk management environment and approach to 
financial reporting. In doing so, the Committee will take into account 
developments in reporting responsibilities, including those relating 
to changes in the UK Corporate Governance Code and other 
regulatory requirements.

External Auditor – reappointment of PwC
The Committee reviewed and assessed PwC’s performance during 
the year and considered its reappointment as the Group’s external 
Auditor. PwC was originally appointed as the Group’s Auditor in 
March 2021, following a tender process in 2019. Giles Hannam 
remained as PwC’s lead audit partner in 2023. 

The Committee regularly reviewed and assessed the progress of the 
audit throughout the year and also undertook a detailed effectiveness 
assessment through two surveys; one for Committee members and 
the other for senior management.

The surveys focused on the following areas:

•  the quality and service of the audit team;

•  audit planning and execution;

•  communication with the Committee and senior management;

•  contribution to process controls and financial reporting; and

•  the independence and objectivity of the Auditors.

The responses to the surveys were positive and noted in particular 
that the PwC audit team had developed a clear audit plan that was 
effectively communicated, demonstrated strong technical expertise 
and provided constructive challenge.

During 2023, the Committee also agreed with PwC that reporting 
would be provided against a series of audit quality indicators to 
support the Committee’s assessment of audit quality. This reporting 
was provided for the first time in February 2024.

Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the PwC audit team 
was providing the required quality in its provision of audit services 
and maintained appropriate levels of independence and objectivity. 
The Committee therefore recommended the continued 
appointment of PwC to the Board.

The Group has complied with the requirements of the Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and 
governance of tenders for the appointment of the external Auditor 
and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services.

Area for focus

Issue/Role of the Committee

Conclusions/Actions taken

Accounting for 
IHG One Rewards

Accounting for IHG One Rewards requires 
significant use of estimation techniques 
and represents a material deferred revenue 
balance. The Committee reviews the 
controls, judgements and estimates related 
to accounting for IHG One Rewards.

Accounting for 
the System Fund

Given the unique nature of the System Fund, 
the Committee reviews the controls and 
processes related to System Fund accounting.

The Committee reviewed the deferred revenue balance, the 
valuation approach, the results of the external actuarial review and 
procedures completed to determine the breakage assumption for 
outstanding IHG One Rewards points. 

The Committee reviewed management’s papers supporting the 
removal of an adjustment made in recent years that placed more 
emphasis on pre-Covid-19 redemption behaviours.

The Committee concluded that the deferred revenue balance 
is appropriately stated.

The Committee met with senior finance management to review 
and evaluate the risk areas associated with the System Fund.

The Committee reviewed a paper from management summarising 
the principles determining the allocation of revenues and expenses 
to the System Fund and the related governance and internal control 
environment. The Committee concluded that the accounting 
treatment of the System Fund and related disclosures are appropriate.

Impairment testing

Litigation and 
contingencies

Exceptional items

Judgement is applied in assessing whether 
triggering events for impairment testing 
of assets or cash-generating units have 
occurred. The Committee scrutinises the 
methodologies applied and the potential 
for asset impairment or impairment reversal.

The Committee reviewed management reports outlining the 
approach taken on impairment testing and key assumptions and 
sensitivities supporting the conclusion on the various asset 
categories. The Committee examined in detail whether triggering 
events for impairment testing had occurred. The Committee agreed 
with the determinations reached on impairment.

From time to time, the Group is subject 
to legal proceedings with the ultimate 
outcome of each being subject to many 
uncertainties. The Committee reviews and 
evaluates the need for provisioning and 
considers the adequacy of the disclosure.

At each meeting during the year, the Committee considered reports 
detailing all material litigation matters including commercial 
disputes. The Committee discussed and agreed any provisioning 
requirements based on underlying factors. Disclosures were 
assessed, with particular emphasis on the completeness of 
uncertainties disclosed. 

The Committee reviewed papers by management and considered 
the consistency of treatment and nature of items classified as 
exceptional. The Committee reviewed and challenged the significance, 
timing and nature of the exceptional items (see pages 179 to 180). 
The Committee also considered the sufficiency of disclosure and 
whether such disclosure explained the rationale for why each item 
is considered to be exceptional. The Committee concluded that the 
disclosures and the treatment of the items shown as exceptional 
are appropriate. 

The Committee reviewed and challenged the scenarios considered 
by management, the detailed cash flow forecasts and the mitigating 
actions available to management considered in its going concern 
assessment to June 2025 and the three-year viability assessment 
and concluded these were appropriate. The Committee also reviewed 
and challenged the reverse stress test assumptions to confirm the 
viability of the Group. The Committee reviewed going concern 
disclosures (page 161) and the viability statement (pages 50 and 51) 
and is satisfied these are appropriate.

The Committee reviewed an analysis from management 
summarising the approach taken to consider climate risk in the 
Group Financial Statements and concluded that the disclosures 
were appropriate. The Committee agreed that the disclosures made 
in respect of the TCFD were appropriate. The Committee satisfied 
itself that the approach across the Annual Report has been 
proportionate and consistent.

The Group exercises judgement in presenting 
exceptional items. The Committee reviews 
and challenges the classification of items 
as exceptional based on their size, nature 
or incidence, with consideration given to 
consistency of treatment with prior years 
and between gains and losses.

Going concern 
and viability

The Committee reviews management’s 
financial modelling to conclude on the 
appropriateness of the going concern 
and viability statement.

Climate risk

In preparing the Group Financial Statements, 
the potential impacts of climate change 
have been considered.

Area for focus

Issue/Role of the Committee

Conclusions/Actions taken

UK deferred 
tax asset

Given the size of the Group’s UK deferred 
tax asset ($113m), the Committee reviewed 
and challenged the key assumptions 
determining the recoverability of the 
deferred tax asset and whether this should 
be disclosed as a significant estimate.

Financial Statement 
disclosures

The Committee considers the 
appropriateness of disclosures in the Group 
Financial Statements. 

The Committee confirmed the estimates used to support the recovery 
of the UK deferred tax asset were consistent with those used in the 
impairment and going concern and viability assessments. Given the 
recovery to levels of profitability assumed in these estimates, the 
Committee concluded that it agreed with the recognition of the 
deferred tax asset, that this was not a significant estimate, as a 
material change in estimate is not expected in the next 12 months, 
and that the disclosures are appropriate.

The Committee reviewed disclosures required on adoption of IFRS 
17 ‘Insurance Contracts’. The Committee also reviewed management’s 
proposals to improve the clarity and succinctness of the Group 
Financial Statements by omitting immaterial disclosures and 
combining disclosures around System Fund and reimbursable 
expenses in certain areas of the Financial Statements. The Committee 
concluded that the disclosures to the Group Financial Statements 
are appropriate and proportional.

Voice of the Employee

As IHG’s designated Non-Executive Director (NED) with 
responsibility for workforce engagement (Voice of the 
Employee), Duriya Farooqui, supported by the Group’s 
Global HR team, held a series of employee interface sessions 
throughout the year to engage directly with members of 
IHG’s corporate and hotel workforces, with the aim of 
sharing feedback with the Board for consideration in its 
decision-making. 

Role and responsibilities 
The role and responsibilities of the designated Voice of the 
Employee NED are to: 

•  support the design of the structure and content of Board 

discussions on employee engagement and culture;

•  evaluate employee engagement approaches and their 

effectiveness;

•  ensure that employee feedback and interests are factored 

into the Board’s decisions and KPI setting;

•  ensure that the Board, through the Executive Committee, 

has effective methods of receiving feedback from employees 
and communicating Board and executive decisions and 
priorities throughout the organisation;

•  ensure all significant business and budget proposals include 
a management assessment of the impact on employees; and

•  ensure executives share employee feedback openly, 

transparently and in a balanced way, including reviewing 
employee engagement surveys and other employee reports, 
including whistleblowing. 

2023 engagement 
Throughout 2023, Duriya, with the participation of several other 
NEDs and Chair Deanna Oppenheimer, hosted fifteen employee 
interface meetings to engage with a cross-section of employees 
and received detailed feedback. These feedback sessions, which 
were a mix of in person and virtual meetings/forums, included 
leader groups within the US and UK hotels, reservations and 
corporate populations, and ERGs across the UK, US, India, China 
and various EMEAA countries as well as colleagues who have 
recently joined the organisation. 

Discussion topics and themes in relation to the feedback received 
from employees included: workplace culture; leader 
communications; strategy, prioritisation and collaboration; 
talent attraction; onboarding and retention; personal and career 
development; technology and systems; and agile ways of working 
and decision-making.

Additional engagement and activities undertaken by Duriya, 
the Chair of the Board, and other NEDs during the year included:

•  monitoring and reviewing the content and feedback from global 

‘all employee’ CEO calls; 

•  reviewing employee engagement survey results; 

•  engaging with the Global HR Leadership team to receive 

broader cultural insights; and 

•  engaging directly with senior leaders at Board and Committee 

meetings, the Board strategy event and the Group’s senior 
leaders’ meeting.

Insights and learnings
Duriya provided regular feedback to the Responsible Business 
Committee and the Board throughout the year, with key Board 
discussions taking place around the insights as well as action 
planning arising from employee engagement survey results. 

Plans for 2024
Duriya will remain as the Board member with responsibility for 
workforce engagement in 2024, assisted by additional NEDs.

A schedule of discussions and feedback sessions has been 
arranged for 2024 and will continue to encompass a wide group 
of employees and leaders from across all regions, including ERGs, 
Lean In Circles and new starters. The discussion topics will be 
tailored to specifically focus on those areas that support the 
strategy. Additionally, the Board will continue to keep the 
functioning of the Voice of the Employee programme under 
review to ensure it meets best practice and complies with 
regulatory developments.

Key duties and role of the Committee
Key objectives and summary of responsibilities
The Committee reviews the composition of the Board and its 
Principal Committees, evaluating the balance of skills, experience, 
independence, knowledge and diversity requirements before 
making appropriate recommendations to the Board as to any 
changes. It also ensures plans are in place for orderly succession 
both for Directors and other senior executives, and is responsible 
for reviewing the Group’s senior leadership needs.

The Committee’s role, responsibilities and authority delegated to it 
by the Board, including processes in relation to appointments, are 
set out in its Terms of Reference (ToR), which are reviewed annually 
and approved by the Board. The ToR state that the Committee is 
responsible for considering potential candidates for appointment 
to the Board based on merit, cognitive and personal strengths with 
due regard for the benefits of diversity, including gender and social, 
ethnic and geographic backgrounds.

  The ToR are available at ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate governance.

The Committee’s key responsibilities and focus areas during the year 
have been:

•  assessing the composition of the Board and the Principal 

Committees and succession planning, including consideration of 
gender balance and ethnic and geographical diversity, in accordance 
with the ToR and consistent with the Group’s Global Diversity, 
Equity, Inclusion and Equal Opportunities Policy (DE&I Policy);

•  engaging with external search consultancies and making 

recommendations on appointments to the Board;

•  overseeing the external performance evaluation of the Board and 
its Principal Committees as well as the evaluation of individual 
Non-Executive Directors; and

•  monitoring the Executive Committee and senior leadership talent 

and succession planning.

Membership and attendance at meetings
The Committee’s membership and attendance at meetings 
are available on page 96. All members of the Committee are 
Non-Executive Directors. When the Committee considers matters 
relating to the Chair of the Nomination Committee position, the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID) acts as 
Committee Chair.

With regard to both searches, desktop reviews were conducted 
to identify suitable candidates for the roles. Shortlisted candidates 
met with various members of the Board and management as relevant, 
with assessments being made on the appropriate competencies, 
functional experience, cultural characteristics and consideration 
of candidates’ other commitments in line with the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.

Following completion of an interview process and reference and 
background checks, the Committee recommended to the Board the 
appointment of Angie Risley as Non-Executive Director and Chair 
Designate of the Remuneration Committee, which was approved 
by the Board with effect from 1 September 2023. 

Likewise, following similar completion of an interview process and 
reference and background checks, the Committee recommended 
to the Board the appointment of Ron Kalifa as Non-Executive 
Director, which was approved by the Board with effect from 
1 January 2024.

Executive Committee talent and succession
Throughout the year, the Committee also received updates on 
talent and succession planning at Executive Committee and senior 
leadership levels, noting in particular progress against 
DE&I objectives.

Information on the gender and ethnicity balance of the Board and 
the Executive Committee is included on page 99. Information on the 
gender and ethnicity balance of senior management is included on 
pages 30 and 31. 

The Group’s DE&I Policy applies in respect of the Board and its 
Principal Committees. The DE&I Policy aims to create a diverse 
culture and support diversity and inclusion. When assessing and 
considering succession planning at Board and Executive Committee 
levels, the Committee takes diversity considerations into account 
consistent with the DE&I Policy. The DE&I Policy aligns to the 
Group’s responsible business commitments and a description of 
progress against these commitments is included in the 2023 DE&I 
Progress Report, available at ihgplc.com/Responsible Business 
under Reporting.

Looking forward
In 2024, the Committee will continue to ensure that we have 
appropriate plans in place for orderly succession of appointments to 
the Board and to senior management, so that an appropriate balance 
of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity is maintained.

Reporting to the Board
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board for all Board 
appointments. Minutes are circulated to and reviewed by Committee 
members, and the Committee Chair reports back to the Board on 
the activities of the Committee following each meeting.

Effectiveness of the Committee and External Evaluation
During 2023, the Committee was reviewed as part of the external 
Board evaluation process. Details of the external evaluation, including 
how it was conducted, the nature and extent of the evaluator’s 
contact with the Board and the actions arising from the evaluation, 
are set out on pages 104 to 106. The Committee concluded that it 
remains effective and succeeds at ensuring that the right number 
and mix of directors with appropriate core skills are brought onto 
the Board. Succession planning at Executive Committee and senior 
management level was identified as an area for continued focus.

Focus areas and activities
Executive Director succession planning 
An overview of the CFO succession process, following which 
Michael Glover was appointed as CFO, was included in last year’s 
Nomination Committee Report on page 113 of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022.

During 2023, the Committee oversaw the CEO succession process 
and the appointment of Elie Maalouf as CEO.

The Committee explored both internal and external candidates for 
the CEO role. A desktop review of possible external candidates was 
conducted by Spencer Stuart; the Chair also met with members 
of the Executive Committee to assess career aspirations and CEO 
capabilities. The Committee considered in particular the relative 
merits of internal and external candidates.

Following the interview process, including a presentation by 
Elie Maalouf to, and discussion with, all Non-Executive Directors, 
the Committee concluded that it should recommend to the Board 
the appointment of Elie as CEO.

The Committee also oversaw induction plans for both Michael and 
Elie in respect of their new roles. Further details of the induction 
plans are provided on page 104.

Board and Principal Committee composition 
and succession planning
The Committee continued to maintain and review throughout the 
year a Board skills matrix and a Board refreshment schedule, which 
track the skills, competencies and experiences of the Board members 
and provide an overview of the Board’s tenure, gender, ethnicity and 
Committee assignment considerations. These helped to inform 
future Board appointments and rotations.

Using this resource, and in anticipation of Jo Harlow reaching a 
nine-year term during the year, the Committee led the process to 
recruit a new Remuneration Committee Chair.

In addition, the Committee determined that the Board would benefit 
from recent CEO experience and further expertise in the technology 
and digital sector. Accordingly, the Committee initiated a search for 
an additional Non-Executive Director to meet this profile.

Spencer Stuart was engaged in connection with the Remuneration 
Committee Chair search (as well as the CEO succession) and 
Heidrick & Struggles was engaged in connection with the other 
Non-Executive Director search. Neither Spencer Stuart nor Heidrick 
& Struggles has any other connection with the Company or any 
individual Directors.

room signings) resulted in awards for Executive Directors of 81.8% 
of maximum reflecting the strong performance of the business 
in 2023;

•  the outcome of the 2021/23 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) award 
cycle, covering the three years from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 
2023, was 57.8% of maximum. The business continued to deliver 
exceptional absolute cash flow management and strong growth 
in relative net system size growth (NSSG). For the first time since 
the 2018/20 cycle, the business also achieved above threshold 
performance over three years against our peers in relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR); 

•  the total average of short- and long-term incentive plan awards 
for the respective period ending 2023 was therefore 67.9% of 
maximum for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Elie Maalouf; and

•  the Committee reviewed the performance outcomes in line with 

the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (DR Policy) and its framework for 
assessing discretion and found no rationale for applying discretion 
to the formulaic outcomes of the 2023 APP and 2021/23 LTIP. 

Directors’ Remuneration Policy – shareholder engagement
We received shareholder approval for our updated DR Policy at 
the 5 May 2023 AGM. The full DR Policy can be found in our 2023 
Notice of AGM and is also summarised on page 121 of this report. 
Ahead of the vote, we directly engaged with owners of around 60% 
of the share capital of the Company and we were pleased that the 
majority of our shareholders supported our new policy. The votes 
of 74.85% in favour of the DR Policy and 76.94% in favour of the 
DRR both represented slightly less than 80% support and, as such, 
Jo Harlow and I met a range of shareholders within a six-month 
window after the AGM vote, as required by the Corporate Governance 
Code. We met with holders of more than 25% of share capital, 
including both those who voted for and against the DR Policy and 
DRR, as well as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and the 
Investment Association. The main points of discussion were:

•  introducing myself as the incoming Remuneration Committee 

Chair with effect from 1 January 2024;

•  following up on comments and concerns on the 2022 DRR and the 

2023 DR Policy; and

•  the new CEO pay arrangements, as set out in the notice published 

following the appointment of Elie Maalouf. 

In these meetings, we heard strong levels of support for the 2023 DR 
Policy and an understanding of the competitive executive pay context, 
consistent with what we had heard in our pre-AGM meetings. For those 
shareholders who had voted against the DRR and DR Policy, the 
rationale commonly related to internal voting guidelines that formed 
red lines for specific DR Policy features, which were not related to the

•  128  Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration

On behalf of the Board, I am delighted to represent the 
Remuneration Committee (the Committee) as Chair and present 
my first Directors’ Remuneration Report (DRR) for the year ended 
31 December 2023. I joined the IHG Board as a Non-Executive 
Director in September 2023, and assumed the role of Chair of the 
Committee on 1 January 2024. I would like to thank my predecessor, 
Jo Harlow, who has successfully overseen the Committee through 
periods of significant change and increasing focus on the Executive 
Remuneration landscape, for her leadership and valuable years of 
service in the role, and for the robust and thorough handover which 
ensured a seamless transition. I would also like to thank all of the 
shareholders I have met so far for their time, insight and support.

2023 business performance context
Guest demand grew again during 2023 as appetite for travel 
continued to improve. We passed the milestone of 6,300 open 
hotels in delivering net system size growth of 3.8% for the year. 
Operating profit from reportable segments, at $1,019 million, 
was up 23% on 2022. Strong growth in revenue combined with our 
disciplined approach to cost management resulted in a 3.4%pts 
improvement in fee margin to 59.3%. From a shareholder perspective, 
we have seen continued growth in shareholder value with the Board 
proposing a final dividend of 104.0¢, representing a growth of 10% 
on 2022, and resulting in a total dividend for the year of 152.3¢. 
Additionally, as a result of strong cash management, we completed 
a share buyback programme to return $750 million of surplus capital 
in December 2023, and a further $800 million programme has been 
approved for 2024.

Overview of 2023 remuneration outcomes
The key highlights of Executive Director incentive plan awards for 
2023 are presented below, and the awards reflect our strong 
business performance during 2023:

•  the achievement on Annual Performance Plan (APP) metrics

increase in LTIP quantum for Executive Directors, and which differed 
by shareholder. The increase in LTIP quantum was thoroughly 
discussed and explained in the consultations leading up to the 
approval of the 2023 DR Policy at the 2023 AGM and in our follow up 
discussions, and was well understood and supported by shareholders, 
based on the transparent benchmarking of the hotel industry. 

In the context of this feedback, and the overall level of support for 
the DR Policy (at almost 75%), the Committee concluded that the 
DR Policy changes reflected the supportive views of a significant 
majority of shareholders, who continue to agree that the commercial 
rationale for the DR Policy changes is critical to the retention and 
development of global talent in order to drive the long-term success 
of the business. Feedback on votes against the DRR indicated that 
these related either to the use of discretion on the LTIP 2020/22 
cash flow outcome or to other shareholder-specific concerns. 
The Committee considers that the 76.94% voting level demonstrated 
strong support for their view that the outcome reflected the 
exceptional performance of the Executive Directors in managing 
cash flow during the pandemic.

Having met with more shareholders in January 2024, their support 
of IHG’s continuous need to improve the competitiveness of 
Executive Director pay was evident. The Board is of the view that 
further changes to Executive Director pay will need to be considered 
in order to help protect our Executive Director retention and talent 
pipeline, which are key for successful future business growth.

  The approved DR Policy is available on IHG’s website at 
ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate governance.

Board changes
The business criticality of attracting and retaining high performing 
Executive Directors and their succession pipeline has been highlighted 
in the departures of the Chief Financial Officer & Group Head of 
Strategy and the Group Chief Executive Officer during 2023. It is 
vital to IHG’s continued growth that the quality of talent existing 
in our current Executive Director team is reflected in our internal 
and external candidates for succession. The vast majority of our 
competitors are based in the US, therefore the corresponding talent 
market is US-based. There remains a significant difference between 
our CEO pay level and that of our US competitors, as well as differences 
in the structure and mix of incentives, and the Committee will remain 
focused and will continue to engage with shareholders going forward 
on how this can be addressed in the context of retaining existing 
talent and developing and retaining successor talent. 

As announced by the Company on 5 May 2023 and the s430(2B) 
of the Companies Act 2006 declaration released on 28 June 2023, 
Keith Barr stepped down from the role of CEO, and from the Board, 
on 30 June 2023. The Committee exercised its discretion to treat 
Keith Barr as a ‘good leaver’, in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of applicable incentive and share plan rules. Elie Maalouf 
succeeded Keith Barr as CEO with effect from 1 July 2023. Elie was 
already a member of IHG’s Board and had been leading IHG’s 
Americas business as regional CEO for eight years.

Historically, our succession strategy has generally been to grow 
executive level successors within the business, particularly in the US. 
Whilst we remain focused on maintaining our ability to secure a strong 
executive level internal succession pipeline, this has become more 
challenging in recent years as those potential successors move to 
positions outside IHG offering more attractive packages at their level 
and above, both in terms of structure (for example, restricted stock 
units) and quantum. The ability to attract Elie Maalouf into the role 
of CEO has enabled us to secure a leader with significant US market 
experience and who continues to maintain key government and 
industry relationships in the US, as well as having an in-depth global 
knowledge of IHG. We are committed to ensuring that there remains 
a robust succession plan in place at executive level. 

We shared remuneration details for Elie Maalouf upon his 
appointment in a voluntary published statement in July 2023, 
as well as in discussions with shareholders in October 2023. 
In our AGM follow-up meetings, strong support was expressed by 
shareholders regarding the way in which succession planning had 
been conducted, as well as for the pay arrangements for Elie, with 
recognition of the competitive challenges we face operating across 
UK and US markets, where pay structures vary substantially.

Elie’s annual base salary of £990,000 represents a 7% increase 
on that of his predecessor; the outgoing CEO Keith Barr would 
have received an estimated 4% increase to his salary in April 2024, 
reducing the difference to 2.9%. Furthermore, Elie will not be subject 
to a salary review until April 2025. We estimate that Elie’s full year 
CEO single total figure of remuneration will not exceed that of Keith 
Barr’s until 2025. Elie’s remuneration remains proportionate in the 
context of both the international hotel peer company and FTSE 100, 
and follows our strategy of growing successor talent in-house. 
The Board is fully supportive of the salary positioning in this context. 
External US recruitment would have involved a more significant pay 
increase and an externally recruited CEO, who would have not yet 
been tested in the IHG environment, would have represented a 
greater risk with less proven value. Full details of the remuneration 
arrangements for Elie Maalouf’s changes are in line with the approved 
DR Policy and can be found on page 126. 

As reported in the 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson stepped down from the role of Chief 
Financial Officer & Group Head of Strategy, and from the Board, 
and left IHG on 19 March 2023. Michael Glover succeeded Paul 
as Chief Financial Officer (CFO), effective 20 March 2023. We were 
delighted to be able to appoint someone with Michael’s expertise 
and experience. He has held several roles in his 18 years at IHG, 
including CFO of IHG’s China region, Group Financial Controller, and 
his most recent role as CFO Americas with group-wide responsibility 
for commercial finance operations.

Jill McDonald and Ian Dyson both stepped down from the Board 
as Non-Executive Directors on 28 February 2023. Subsequently, 
Graham Allan was appointed Chair of the Responsible Business 
Committee and Byron Grote was appointed Chair of the Audit 
Committee; both appointments took effect on 1 March 2023. I was 
appointed to the Board with effect from 1 September 2023, with 
membership of the Remuneration and Responsible Business 
Committees from that date, and assumed the Remuneration 
Committee Chair role on 1 January 2024. Sir Ron Kalifa joined the 
Board, with effect from 1 January 2024, becoming a member of the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees. The remuneration arrangements 
in respect of all changes were in line with the approved DR Policy 
and are covered on pages 126 and 127.

Wider workforce remuneration and employee engagement
The Committee is extremely mindful of ongoing inflationary pressures 
across many of our markets and its impact on the financial and 
emotional wellbeing of our employees. In 2023, salary increases for 
the UK and US corporate populations were above that for the CEO in 
role at the time. The overall average budget for 2024 increases is 4% 
for our global corporate workforce, with total budgets in the UK and 
the US being 4.2% and 3.6% respectively. The CEO is not eligible to 
receive a merit increase for 2024 following his appointment in July 
2023, as explained above. We have also made an additional 15% 
available to the budgeted amount for the personal performance 
element of our 2023 Annual Performance Plan to increase bonus 
amounts for our strongest performers. 

For the UK leased hotel estate, in agreement with the owner, budgeted 
2023 salary increases ranged from 5% to 8%, with higher increases 
applicable for frontline employees, and one-off payments made to 
employees in 2023 for those who had worked for at least the final 
three months of 2022. Budgeted 2024 salary increases range from 
3% to 13% with higher increases applicable for frontline employees.

Remuneration Committee Chair’s statement

The Real Living Wage will be applied for 12 months from April 2024, 
as a minimum for all staff, in line with the Real Living Wage Foundation 
level, and zero-hour contracts are not utilised in the UK leased estate.

 – The TSR comparator group has been expanded from 8 to 15 
global hotel companies. Details of the new TSR comparator 
group can be found on pages 138 and 140.

In 2023, we also introduced a salary sacrifice electric car scheme 
for UK corporate colleagues, enhanced maternity and paternity 
pay for our UK managed hotels, and partnered with Busy Bees to 
provide both our UK corporate colleagues and our UK managed 
hotels a 20% discount on childcare fees. Further details of our 
approach to remuneration across the wider workforce, in general 
and throughout the year, are outlined on pages 123 to 124.

We were pleased to see overall employee engagement scores 
remain resilient at 87%, exceeding external benchmarks by 10%. 
Perceptions of pay also remained strong, exceeding external 
benchmarks across our hotel, reservations and general manager 
populations (see page 124). It is also pleasing to see that we have 
reduced our Gender Pay gap in the UK by 16% since 2017. I look 
forward to participating in some employee engagement sessions 
during 2024, as noted on page 127, and hearing views about 
remuneration more generally.

Implementation of Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2024
As covered in more detail on pages 138 to 140:

•  With regards to salary increases for Executive Directors, as 

mentioned above, the CEO will not receive an increase in 2024; 
the CFO will receive an increase in line with that of the  
global corporate workforce following an assessment of 
2023 performance. 

•  The non-financial measures for the 2024 Annual Performance Plan 
will remain as room openings and room signings, aligned to our 
key strategic objectives for our future growth priorities, and the 
financial measure will remain as operating profit from reportable 
segments, as in 2023. 

•  LTIP 2024/26 cycle measures will remain as relative TSR, relative 

net system size growth, absolute cash flow, adjusted earnings per 
share and ESG. Retaining the same balance of measures for the 
2024/26 cycle maintains an overall business performance focus.

 – New ESG metrics have been implemented, with environmental 
metrics based on Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) and 
hotels that operate at low/zero carbon, as key areas in 
management control that support delivery of our carbon and 
energy goals. New People measures build on our 2023/25 LTIP 
representation targets. The new measures focus on quantitative 
targets in relation to driving greater inclusion and growing our 
next generation of hotel general managers from our talent 
pipelines. The Committee considers this innovative approach to 
People measures to be relevant and appropriate for the Company 
and fully aligned to our priorities in this area. See pages 139 and 
140 for more details.

•  Retirement benefits for incumbent UK Executive Directors will 

continue to align with the maximum company contribution available 
to all other participants in the UK Pension plan.

 Certain KPIs and Non-GAAP measures are used throughout the Directors’ Remuneration Report. See pages 84 to 88 for additional detail. 

Use of Non-GAAP measures: in addition to performance measures directly observable in the Group Financial Statements (IFRS measures), 
additional financial measures (described as Non-GAAP) are presented that are used internally by management as key measures to assess 
performance. Non-GAAP measures are either not defined under IFRS or are adjusted IFRS figures. Further explanation in relation to these 
measures can be found on pages 84 to 88 and reconciliations to IFRS figures, where they have been adjusted, are on pages 226 to 228.

Executive Director remuneration

2023 actual remuneration vs potential remuneration
The charts below show the 2023 potential remuneration opportunity and actual achievement compared to the 2022 actual achievement. 
The relevant figures for each of the elements that make up the single total figure of remuneration, as shown below for the Executive Directors, 
can be found in the table on page 128. See above for the key to individual elements of actual remuneration for 2022 and 2023.

For the purpose of reading the charts below, please note the following:

•  Elie Maalouf’s 2023 figures are a combined total based on his CEO, Americas role for the 1 January to 30 June period and Group CEO role 

for the 1 July to 31 December period.

•  For Michael Glover, we have not shown 2022 figures as he was promoted to the Board on 20 March 2023 and was not an Executive 

Director for the 2022 period. His 2023 figures are based on fixed pay and APP for the period 20 March to 31 December and LTIP for the full 
2021/23 cycle.

•  The one-off relocation payments made to Elie Maalouf and Michael Glover in 2023 have been included within their benefits figure for the 

purpose of the charts below. The respective amounts have been disclosed in the Other column of the single total figure table on page 128.

•  For both Keith Barr and Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson, their 2023 actual and potential figures are based on the period in which they were 

Executive Directors only (1 January-30 June 2023 for Keith Barr; and 1 January-19 March 2023 for Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson).

How we performed in 2023

The Company delivered another year of strong performance against target in operating profit from reportable segments. Room openings 
were below target this year and room signings narrowly missed target, by less than one percent, however, both these measures achieved 
well above threshold performance. In the round, this meant the formulaic 2023 APP achievement was 142.2% of target, resulting in awards 
for Executive Directors of 163.5% of salary (81.8% of the capped maximum award). Under the LTIP, improved TSR performance against 
comparators resulted in the vesting of this element for the first time since the 2018/20 cycle. This, combined with a solid net system size 
growth performance relative to our largest competitors and an exceptional management of cash flow, resulted in a formulaic outcome of 
57.8% of maximum. Further details on the actual achievement for operating profit from reportable segments and absolute cash flow can 
be found on pages 128 and 129.

In respect of the post-employment 
shareholding requirement, the full 
guideline shareholding requirement 
will normally continue for two years 
post-cessation of employment.

  A copy of the DR Policy, approved in May 2023, is available on IHG’s website at ihgplc.com/investors under Corporate Governance.

The Committee has considered the remuneration policy and practices in the context of Provision 40 of the UK Corporate Governance Code:

Principle

Clarity 

IHG’s approach

Through the combination of short- and long-term incentive plan measures, the DR Policy is structured to support financial objectives and 
the strategic priorities of the business that deliver shareholder returns and long-term value creation. Further alignment with shareholder 
interests is driven by the significant proportion of share-based incentives and Executive Director shareholding requirements. Our reward 
policies are aligned throughout the organisation and include a proportion of performance-related reward, driving engagement for the whole 
of the workforce. We always seek to report our DR Policy and performance-related remuneration measures, targets and outcomes in a clear, 
transparent and balanced way, with relevant and timely communication with all of our stakeholders, including shareholders. 

Simplicity

Our remuneration structure comprises straightforward and well-understood components. The purpose, structure and strategic alignment 
of each element is clearly laid out in the remuneration policy summary table:

•  fixed pay: base salary, pension and benefits that are consistent with role and location and are designed to attract and retain talent;

•  short-term incentive: annual performance-related bonus which incentivises and rewards the delivery of financial and non-financial 

strategic objectives. For senior employees, a proportion of this bonus is paid in cash and the remainder deferred in shares for a period 
of at least three years; and

•  long-term incentive: a share-based award which incentivises performance over a three-year period based on measures that drive 

long-term sustainable growth and value creation.

Principle

IHG’s approach

Predictability

The range of possible values of rewards for Executive Directors is clearly disclosed in graphical form both at the time of approving the policy 
and in the annual implementation report.

Risk

Our DR Policy contains a number of elements to ensure that it drives the right behaviours to incentivise the Executive Directors to deliver 
long-term sustainable growth and shareholder returns and to reward them appropriately:

•  the maximum short- and long-term incentive awards are capped as a % of salary;

•  the Committee has clear discretion policies, linked to specific measures where necessary, to override formulaic outcomes;

•  Executive Directors agree to clear and comprehensive malus and clawback provisions; and

•  significant shareholding requirements apply for Executive Directors, including the deferral of 30% to 50% of bonus in shares; a two-year 

post-vest holding period for LTIP shares and minimum shareholding requirements both during and after employment.

Proportionality

Individual rewards are aligned to the delivery of strategic business objectives. The Committee sets robust and stretching targets to ensure 
that there is a clear link between the performance of the Group and the awards made to Executive Directors and others.

Alignment 
to culture 

IHG has a clear purpose and well-established values and behaviours. The alignment between remuneration incentives and our strategy for 
relentless focus on growth, and the KPIs that underpin the delivery of our strategy, is outlined below. Other elements of reward, such as 
salary reviews and, across the wider workforce, the short-term incentive plan and our global recognition scheme, reward employees for 
performance and actions that demonstrate our values and behaviours.

•  The strength and breadth of our portfolio, tailored services 
and solutions, as well as our technology and platforms drive 
consumer preference, owner returns and rooms growth; 
all contributing to our revenues and profit.

•  Openings and signings are two of our key drivers of system 
size and central to our strategy of accelerating the growth 
of our brands in high-value markets.

•  Performance on Global Metrics, including key ESG measures 
(Employee Engagement, Guest Love, Responsible Business), 
will be reviewed in considering the potential application 
of discretion to formulaic outcomes on APP strategic 
objective measures.

•  Our strategy is intended to deliver unmatched guest 

experiences and unrivalled owner returns for our stakeholders, 
including competitive total shareholder returns.

•  Our strategy is to accelerate the growth of our brands in 

high-value markets by using our global scale and expertise 
so it is important that this forms a key element of our 
management team’s Long Term Incentive Plan.

•  Enhancing our customer and owner offer and accelerating the 
growth of our brands in high-value markets drives sustained 
growth in cash flows and profits over the long term, which can 
be reinvested in our business and returned to shareholders.

•  Aligned to our people, communities, and planet strategy, 

new ESG measures (decarbonisation, and diversity, equity 
and inclusion) are included in our LTIP targets.

•  EPS provides a measure of the efficiency of the capital 
structure, as well as promoting further alignment with 
shareholder experience and value.

Remuneration at IHG – the wider context

Our reward philosophy

Our reward arrangements are competitive, drive creation of value for stakeholders and make 
us think and act as one team.

How our reward practices are aligned across all levels of the organisation
Our approach to fairness in reward is an important aspect of our overall reward philosophy and is designed to attract, retain, motivate and 
engage top talent. It is supported by a robust governance approach that ensures our reward and recognition practices are fair and consistent 
across our employee and colleague population, regardless of gender and other aspects of diversity, as well as an alignment between the wider 
direct workforce and executive remuneration. We regularly review our approach externally, ensuring we are competitive in the different 
markets in which we operate and meet the needs of employees by offering market-driven reward packages.

In the 2023 base salary review process, we continued to put our managers at the heart of the process, allowing them 
to use their discretion in pay decisions. We also included an additional 25% on top of the standard merit budget in order 
to address equity and recognise talent. With continuous improvements on our external benchmarking capability, we 
provided additional line manager support with market data analysis and guidance so that the budget could be targeted 
in areas where it would have the most impact. Our managers are reminded of our diversity, equity and inclusion statement 
on making fair reward decisions consistent with our Code of Conduct to ensure all employees are rewarded fairly and 
according to their contribution, skills and experience, with tips on avoiding any conscious and unconscious bias. 
For 2024, an additional merit budget will again be made available to address individual equity and talent recognition.

In 2023, we introduced an electric car salary sacrifice scheme allowing UK corporate colleagues to obtain an electric 
car and receive both tax and national insurance savings, whilst at the same time supporting our Journey to Tomorrow 
environmental commitments. So far, 5.8% of those eligible for the scheme have ordered vehicles to date, which is 16.8% 
of those who have registered interest in the scheme. We also understand the demands faced by working parents and 
carers when it comes to balancing their work and home life, so we partnered with Busy Bees to provide our UK corporate 
colleagues, along with our UK managed hotels, a 20% discount on childcare fees. A key element of our employer brand 
and beloved colleague benefits is our Employee Room Rate programme, which enables employees to book hotels across 
many of our brands at a reduced rate. This year, we enabled colleagues to earn IHG One Reward points on Employee Rate 
stays, and are working on additional enhancements to the programme in the future. The levels of healthcare cover on 
offer in the UK continued to align across all UK corporate colleagues. 

   Pension 
benefit

All

Pension and retirement benefits are provided in the UK and US in line with market practice.

UK: the contribution rate for corporate and eligible hotel employees in the IHG UK pension plan is aligned across the 
eligible population with a 2:1 matching ratio up to a maximum of 6% of salary from employees and 12% from the Company. 

US: US retirement saving plans are made up of a 401(k) plan which has a 1:1 matching contribution ratio up to a maximum 
of 6% of salary for eligible corporate employees and a Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) that provides for supplementary 
company contributions of up to 16% provided at senior levels (a historic grandfathered rate of 20% applies for a small 
number of employees who were already receiving this rate when it was removed effective 1 January 2017).

Performance 
Plan (APP) 

All

All corporate employees share the same corporate performance metrics with the Executive Committee and Executive 
Directors. For senior management (generally at Executive Committee (EC) level and their direct reports), a proportion of 
bonus is deferred into shares for a three-year period. The weightings of metrics for all corporate employees below EC 
level are aligned and a greater portion of an award can be achieved through an employee’s individual performance and 
contribution to the Company. In addition, in view of the strong performance in 2023, approximately 15% is being added 
to the amount budgeted for the personal performance element to increase awards for those employees who performed 
the strongest during 2023.

and senior 
management

Senior/mid-management and certain specialist roles are eligible to participate in a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). 
Performance-based LTIP awards largely apply at the level of Executive Committee and their direct reports; Restricted 
Stock Units typically apply for eligible employees below this level (see below). In 2023, at the same time as levels for 
Executive Directors were increased under the new DR Policy, LTIP levels for senior management were adjusted for market 
competitiveness and to better facilitate internal progression and relieve compression.

In line with typical market practice, particularly in the US, and due to line-of-sight over performance measures, a gradually 
greater proportion of the LTIP award is made as RSUs (which are not subject to performance conditions but still align 
employee interests with those of shareholders) for eligible roles from Executive Committee level down.

IHG matches the number of shares purchased by employees, up to a value of USD 1,000 per year, on a 1-for-1 basis. 
We expanded the offering of our Colleague Share Plan to include those in our Corporate Reservations offices, as well 
as a small number of corporate colleagues in countries that were not previously eligible, making the plan available to 
approximately 98% of our corporate employees below the senior/mid-management level (who receive LTIP and/or 
RSU awards). The registration for 2024 was open to eligible colleagues in Q4 2023, and the take-up rate for the 2024 plan, 
including the newly eligible population is 34.8%. For a similar comparison on previous disclosures, the take-up rate 
excluding the new population is 51.2% (vs. 50.3% for the 2023 plan). Over 26,100 matching shares vested from the 
2021 Colleague Share Plan in January 2023; the 2022 plan’s matching share awards vested in January 2024 with over 
30,900 shares vesting between 2,028 employees.

schemes

All

Colleagues who are below Senior Leader level can be nominated for a cash award through our Bravo recognition 
scheme, they can be nominated for going above and beyond in their jobs while displaying exceptional IHG behaviours. 
All of the corporate workforce, including Executive Directors, are eligible to receive a Long-Term Service Award, of 
varying value, once the employee reaches certain service milestones. In 2023, 3,834 one-off cash recognition awards 
were made to corporate colleagues and 3,438 to hotel colleagues globally; 814 corporate colleagues and 995 hotel 
colleagues globally received cash long-term service awards. 

Employee engagement on pay
We have several forums available for employees to share their thoughts, including employee resource groups (ERGs), a designated 
Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement and our employee engagement survey, known as Colleague HeartBeat, which allows 
employees to express their views on key aspects of working at IHG. As the charts below show, the 2023 employee engagement scores for 
participating hotel and reservations employees and general managers on the questions relating to reward and recognition exceeded our 
survey provider’s top quartile benchmark.

Wellbeing
We have continued to promote myWellbeing – a framework to support employees across their health, lifestyle and workplace. 
The myWellbeing suite of resources, which includes an employee Wellbeing Handbook and guidelines for people managers, has been 
designed to provide a holistic wellbeing offering. Employees also have access to a global Employee Assistance Programme, which offers 
counselling, practical guidance on topics such as legal, financial and work matters, and additional health and wellbeing resources.

In the UK, we introduced a network of Mental Health First Aiders. This is part of our commitment to ensure the right support is in place to help 
everyone feel at their best and forms part of our approach to make mental health support more accessible and further unlock the stigma. 
We trained a small number of people in 2023, with the potential to roll out more widely at IHG across other markets, including our UK 
managed hotel estate. We increased our focus on financial education, providing our UK corporate colleagues with free expert information 
and guidance to stay on track to achieve both financial goals and objectives and to support them on their personal financial journeys by 
offering group webinar sessions and wellbeing articles.

We have also continued to champion initiatives such as Focused Fridays, where we limit meetings, and Recharge Days, where corporate 
colleagues can spend the day doing whatever they need to unwind. In 2023, all corporate colleagues were given three recharge days 
to spend as they please, on top of any contracted annual leave they are eligible to receive. These initiatives have helped us achieve a 
3% increase in our Wellbeing Index scores for all of our colleagues, and a 2% increase to 89% for our hotel colleagues on last year’s scores.

UK leased hotel employees
As previously reported, following the acquisition of a number of UK hotels in 2019, employing entities for the estate’s hotels were transferred 
to IHG. Employment terms, including remuneration and benefits, largely remained in place on their pre-acquisition basis. As with the model 
for leased hotels generally, IHG provides hotel management support to the owners of these UK leased hotels and makes recommendations 
on matters, including pay, based on market insight and experience. Decisions on implementing pay changes are ultimately determined by 
the hotel estate owner in the context of their own commercial position and equities across the wider portfolio. 

•  Salary increases for 2023 ranged from 5% to 8%, with higher increases applicable for frontline employees. The Real Living Wage will 

continue to be applied as a minimum for all staff in line with the Real Living Wage Foundation level and zero-hour contracts are not utilised 
in the UK leased estate.

•  Hotel colleagues receive similar benefits to corporate employees, including enrolment into a workplace pension, employee room rates, 

Employee Assistance Programme, Bravo recognition programme, retail discount vouchers, the myWellbeing programme and refer-a-friend 
bonus. Frontline colleagues can also receive incentives and performance-driven bonuses and eligible managers receive an annual 
performance bonus. In April 2023, enhanced maternity and paternity pay was launched for all hotel colleagues and we also teamed up 
with Busy Bees Nurseries to offer our managed hotel colleagues a 20% discount on childcare fees.

Championing a diverse culture where everyone can thrive
One of our 2030 commitments is to drive gender balance and a doubling of under-represented groups across our leadership, and we are 
building on the significant progress we have made over the past decade towards achieving gender balance, with 35% of our leaders (VP and 
above) being female (vs. an ambition of 39% by 2025), and a gender-balanced employee population, of which 52% is female. We are delighted 
to be recognised by Forbes as one of the world’s top companies for women, and we were rated second on the Financial Times Diversity 
Leaders in 2024. We have reduced our Gender Pay gap in the UK by 16% since 2017, our first year of reporting.

 Our latest Gender Pay report is available on IHG’s website at ihgplc.com/en/responsible-business/reporting under Reporting.

Remuneration Committee details

2023 focus areas

•  Review and approval of 2022 remuneration outcomes and 2023 incentive plan structures and targets.

•  In-year performance and relative performance tracking.

•  Wider workforce remuneration matters.

•  ESG in incentives.

•  Review, approval and implementation of the 2023 DR Policy.

•  Review, approval and implementation of the Deferred Award Plan (DAP) rules.

•  Shareholder engagement prior to, and following, the AGM vote.

•  CEO remuneration package.

Key objectives and summary of responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee agrees, on behalf of the Board, all 
aspects of remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Executive 
Committee and the Chair of the Board, and also agrees the strategy, 
direction and policy for the remuneration of the senior executives 
who have a significant influence over the Group’s ability to meet 
its strategic objectives. Additionally, the Committee reviews wider 
workforce pay policies and practice to ensure alignment with 
strategy, values and behaviours and takes this into account when 
setting Executive Director remuneration. The Committee’s role and 
responsibilities are set out in its Terms of Reference (ToR), which are 
reviewed annually and approved by the Board.

  The ToR are available on IHG’s website at ihgplc.com/investors 
under Corporate governance.

Membership and attendance at meetings
Details of the Committee membership and meeting attendance 
are set out on pages 96 and 118.

During 2023, the Committee was supported internally by the 
Company Chair, the Group’s CEO and CFO, and the heads of 
Human Resources and Reward as necessary. All attend by invitation 
to provide further background information and context to assist the 
Committee in its duties. They are not present for any discussions 
that relate directly to their own remuneration or where their 
attendance would not be appropriate.

Reporting to the Board
The Committee Chair updates the Board on all key issues raised at 
Committee meetings. Papers and minutes for each meeting are also 
circulated to all Board members for review and comment.

Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment  
and notice periods
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment, which are 
available upon request from the Company Secretary’s office.

Deanna Oppenheimer, Non-Executive Chair, is subject to 12 months’ 
notice and is in compliance with Provision 19 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. No other Non-Executive Directors are subject to 
notice periods; all Non-Executive Directors are subject to an annual 
re-election by shareholders at the AGM.

Effectiveness of the Committee
The effectiveness of the Committee is monitored and assessed 
regularly by the Chair of the Committee and the Chair of the Board.

Remuneration advisers
IHG appointed Deloitte LLP to act as independent adviser to the 
Committee in 2019 following a competitive tender process undertaken 
by the Committee. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and, as such, operates under the code of conduct 
in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.

Fees of £159,400 were paid to Deloitte in respect of advice provided 
to the Committee in 2023, which included significant input into the 
review and implementation of the DR Policy during the year. This was 
in the form of an agreed fee for support in the preparation of papers 
and attendance at meetings, with work on additional items charged 
at hourly rates. The terms of engagement for Deloitte are available 
from the Company Secretary’s office upon request. Separately, 
other parts of Deloitte LLP also advised the Company in relation to 
corporation tax, mobility and consulting services. The Committee 
is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent.

Approach to target setting
Targets are set by the Committee and senior management, taking 
into account IHG’s growth ambitions and long-range business plan, 
market expectations and the circumstances and relative performance 
at the time, to set stretching achievement targets for senior executives 
that will reflect successful outcomes for the business based on its 
strategic and financial objectives for the period.

Absolute targets may be set relative to budget and/or by reference 
to prior results, generally containing a performance range with 
additional stretch to incentivise outperformance and minimum 
performance levels for payout. Relative targets are set against an 
appropriate comparator group of companies for the relevant measure, 
for example, relative NSSG in the LTIP was set against our six largest 
competitors with over 500k rooms to reflect our strategy of 
accelerating the growth of our brands in high-value markets.

Performance will be reviewed throughout the period in which it 
is applicable for, and, if any corrections are required, this will be 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year in 
which the correction has been agreed. Details on a correction for 
the 2023/25 LTIP calculation can be found on page 132.

Shareholder engagement
The Chair of the Committee engaged extensively with shareholders 
during 2023 in respect of the DR Policy, both in advance of the AGM 
and following the vote of less than 80% support at the AGM, in order 
to understand the range of views held by shareholders and to take 
these into account when setting and implementing the policy, as 
well as outline the rationale for the changes made. 

At the October 2023 meetings, in addition to follow-up comments 
on the 2023 DRR and DR Policy, Angie Risley was introduced to 
shareholders as the Committee Chair designate, effective 1 January 
2024, and new CEO pay arrangements were discussed for 
Elie Maalouf, following his appointment to the role. In January 2024, 
shortly after Angie commenced her role as Committee Chair, 
she held meetings with shareholders for more comprehensive 
two-way introductions and discussions about current IHG-specific 
remuneration challenges and shareholder views and expectations. 
Further information on shareholder engagement is contained in the 
Chair’s Statement on pages 116 to 118.

Board changes
During the year, Byron Grote and Graham Allan replaced Ian Dyson 
and Jill McDonald as Chair of the Audit Committee and Chair of the 
Responsible Business Committee with effect from 1 March 2023 
after Ian and Jill retired from the Board. Jo Harlow also stepped 
down from the Board and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee

Director prior to assuming the Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
role effective 1 January 2024 and Sir Ron Kalifa was appointed to the 
Board from 1 January 2024. The remuneration arrangements in 
respect of all changes were in line with the approved DR Policy.

As announced by the Company on 5 May 2023 and the s430(2B) 
of the Companies Act 2006 declaration released on 28 June 2023, 
Keith Barr stepped down from the role of Chief Executive Officer, 
and from the Board, on 30 June 2023. Elie Maalouf succeeded 
Keith Barr as Group CEO with effect from 1 July 2023, Elie was already 
a member of IHG’s Board in leading IHG’s Americas business as 
regional CEO. 

Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson stepped down from the role of Chief 
Financial Officer & Group Head of Strategy, and from the Board, 
leaving IHG on 19 March 2023. Michael Glover succeeded Paul 
as Chief Financial Officer with effect from 20 March 2023. 

Details of the arrangements for all Executive Directors are as follows:

AUDITED

Remuneration component

How this was implemented in 2023

Elie Maalouf

Salary, pension and benefits

Elie’s base salary for the role of CEO from 1 July 2023 is £990,000 and he will not be eligible for a salary increase 
until April 2025. Elie’s pension cash allowance is 12% of salary, which is within the maximum opportunity of the 2023 
DR Policy and aligns to the wider IHG UK pension plan participants. Elie’s benefits are in line with the DR Policy. 

Annual Performance Plan (APP)

Elie’s APP levels are in line with the maximum opportunity of the DR Policy. His 2023 APP award will be pro-rated 
using the respective salaries for the respective periods before and after his appointment as Group CEO. 

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Elie’s LTIP award levels align with the maximum opportunity shown in the DR Policy.

Other

Elie relocated from the CEO, Americas role based out of the Atlanta office to the Group CEO role, which is primarily 
based out of the UK office. On appointment, and in line with how we treat other international moves, Elie received 
a one-off net cash payment of £50,000 towards costs associated with setting up a UK base. The grossed up value 
of this payment has been disclosed in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 128.

To facilitate Elie to carry out his UK-based role while maintaining his US home and IHG’s significant business, 
government and industry interests in the US, he also receives a net amount of £10,000 per month towards UK 
housing costs. The actual net cost per month on housing for 2023 was, on average, lower than this but will be 
adjusted to allow for rental market dynamics over the longer term.

Michael Glover

Salary, pension and benefits

Michael’s base salary from 20 March 2023 is £620,000 and he was not eligible for a merit increase in April 2023. 
His pension and other benefits are in line with the DR Policy.

Annual Performance Plan (APP) Michael’s APP levels are in line with the DR Policy. His 2023 APP award will be pro-rated using the respective salaries 

and targets for the respective periods before and after his appointment as Group CFO.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Michael’s LTIP award levels are in line with the DR Policy. He was granted an award at Executive Director level for the 

full 2023/25 cycle, however, did not receive an uplift into in-flight cycles at the increased Executive Director levels.

Other

Keith Barr

Salary, pension and benefits

Annual Performance Plan (APP)

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Michael relocated from his CFO, Americas, role based out of the Atlanta office to the Group CFO role in the UK head 
office. In line with how we treat other international moves, a series of one-off payments to cover relocation and 
associated costs apply for the first three years: £150,000 payments both on appointment and on the first anniversary 
of appointment and £100,000 on the second anniversary of appointment.

Keith received his base salary, pension cash allowance and benefits to 30 June 2023, details of which are included 
in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 128. After he stepped down from the Board, he remained an 
employee of the Company on his existing terms of employment until 31 December 2023 to ensure an orderly handover. 
As an employee, he continued to be paid a salary and receive his existing benefits through to that date, apart from 
healthcare provision, which will continue for up to three months after this date. 

Keith is eligible to receive an APP award in respect of the full 2023 financial year, which is assessed and paid in the 
usual way and in accordance with the terms of the plan. Half of any APP earned will be delivered in cash following 
the end of the performance year, with the other half deferred into shares for three years. The pro-rated element for 
the 2023 period in which he served as Group CEO can be found in the single total figure table. The Remuneration 
Committee exercised its discretion to determine that he would be treated as a ‘good leaver’. Accordingly, his 
unvested deferred APP shares will not be forfeited on departure and will vest in full on their original vesting dates.

Keith’s share awards, granted in 2021 and 2022, under the LTIP are preserved in accordance with the ‘good leaver’ 
provisions, subject to the achievement of the relevant performance conditions, adjusted for pro-ration until the date he 
ceased employment with the Company, and vesting on their original vesting dates. In accordance with the DR Policy, 
they will be subject to a two-year post-vest holding period. The LTIP 2021/23 cycle award is disclosed in the 2023 single 
total figure of remuneration table on page 128. He has not received an LTIP award in respect of the 2023/25 cycle.

Minimum Shareholding Policy

The post-employment shareholding policy approved at the time of Keith’s termination has been applied. He is 
required to hold shares equivalent to his minimum shareholding requirement of 500% of salary for six months 
post-cessation and 50% of the minimum shareholding requirement for a further six months. 

Other

IHG also agreed to settle fees of £13,850 plus VAT for legal advice to Keith on his leaving arrangements.

Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson

Salary, pension and benefits

Annual Performance Plan (APP)

Paul’s salary, pension and benefits were paid up until 19 March 2023, details of which are included in the single total 
figure of remuneration table on page 128. In line with our previous commitment, his pension had been reduced to 
the rate of all other IHG UK pension plan participants, which is 12% of salary, from 1 January 2023. No further payments 
in respect of these elements were paid beyond 19 March 2023, given he was taking up new employment.

Paul remained eligible to receive an APP award in respect of the full 2022 performance year. In line with our 
termination policy, the cash element was paid in the usual way, but the deferred share awards portion was forfeited. 
He was not eligible to receive an APP award in respect of 2023. All outstanding APP shares that had not vested on 
19 March 2023 were forfeited.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Paul’s LTIP 2020/22 award was assessed in the same way as for the other Executive Directors and it vested on 
22 February 2023, and is subject to a two-year holding period. He was not eligible to receive an LTIP award in respect 
of 2023. All outstanding LTIP awards that had not vested on 19 March 2023 were forfeited.

Minimum Shareholding Policy

The post-employment shareholding policy approved at the time of Paul’s termination has been applied. He is 
required to hold shares equivalent to his minimum shareholding requirement of 300% of salary as at the date of 
leaving for six months post-cessation and 50% of the minimum shareholding requirements for a further six months. 
He remained compliant with this policy throughout 2023.

Other

No other payments have been made in connection with his leaving.

Wider workforce remuneration and employee engagement
As outlined on pages 123 to 124, IHG operates an aligned approach 
to remuneration throughout the organisation. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed aspects of the Company’s wider workforce 
remuneration approach as part of its regular meeting agenda. 

The Company engaged with the workforce through its employee 
engagement survey, which covers a number of areas, including pay 
and benefits competitiveness, wellness and inclusion. Our overall 
employee engagement increased to 87% (+1% on 2022), placing IHG 
as a Global Best Employer by Kincentric. As noted on page 124, 
perceptions of reward and recognition gained strong results across 
our hotel, reservations and general manager populations. 

During 2023, the Chair of the Committee joined IHG’s designated 
Non-Executive Director responsible for workforce engagement in a 
Voice of the Employee session. These sessions are held throughout 
the year to engage directly with members of IHG’s corporate and 
hotel workforce, with the aim of collating and sharing such feedback 
with the Board for consideration in its decision-making. No concerns 
were raised regarding Executive Director remuneration or how it 
aligns with the wider IHG remuneration principles. Further details 
about the 2023 Voice of the Employee engagement sessions can 
be found on page 113. Further sessions are planned for 2024 for 
Angie to attend as the new Chair of the Committee.

Deferred Award Plan rules
In 2023, the new DAP rules were approved by shareholders at the 
May AGM. The DAP replaced both the previous APP and LTIP rules as 
a simplified, combined set of plan rules to govern the share awards 
made under the Company’s discretionary incentive arrangements. 

The rules for both the APP and LTIP were due to expire in 2024, and 
the Committee considered it appropriate to renew them a year early 
to coincide with the adoption of the new DR Policy. Following approval 
at the 2023 AGM, LTIP share awards were granted under the DAP 
with effect from the 2023/25 cycle, and future APP share awards 
will be granted under the DAP with effect from the 2024 plan year. 
All awards granted under previous cycles will remain subject to the 
APP and LTIP rules that were previously in place.

Service contracts and notice periods for Executive Directors 
The Committee’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have service 
contracts with a notice period of 12 months from the Company and 
a notice period of 6 months for the employee, unless, on an 
exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, 
a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used. This is 
in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 

All Executive Directors’ appointments and subsequent 
re-appointments to the Board are subject to election and annual 
re-election by shareholders at the AGM.

a  LTIP figures for 2022 relate to the 2020/22 LTIP cycle and have been restated using actual share price on date of vesting. Figures for 2023 relate to the value of shares for the 

2021/23 cycle.

b  Elie Maalouf’s 2023 figure combines his CEO, Americas role for the period 1 January to 30 June, and his Group CEO role for the period 1 July to 31 December. Elie was paid in USD for 
his CEO, Americas role and the sterling equivalent is calculated using an exchange rate of $1 = £0.80 in 2023 and $1 = £0.81 in 2022 (page 173). In line with 2023, the 2022 benefits 
figure has been restated to reduce the residual value of UK tax paid in respect of UK duties while a US Director from £7k to nil due to subsequent foreign tax credit offsetting.
c  Michael Glover’s 2023 fixed pay elements relate to the period 20 March to 31 December 2023. His APP has been pro-rated for the period in which he was Executive Director 
and his LTIP award, inclusive of Restricted Stock Units, is for the full 2021/23 LTIP cycle. His LTIP and RSU 2021/23 awards were granted in May 2021 prior to becoming an 
Executive Director, the same performance conditions applied to the LTIP award as they did for the Executive Directors; the RSU awards were not subject to any performance 
conditions. No 2022 data has been provided because he was not in an Executive Director role at the time.

d  Keith Barr stepped down from the CEO role on 30 June 2023 so 2023 figures related to the period 1 January to 30 June 2023, with the exception of his LTIP 2021/23 which the 

full cycle value has been disclosed. Further details on the treatment of his remuneration on leaving IHG can be found on page 126.

e  Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson left the Company on 19 March 2023 and his fixed pay elements were paid up to this date. He was not eligible to receive an APP award for 2023 and his 

LTIP 2021/23 award was forfeited upon leaving IHG. Further details on the treatment of his remuneration on leaving IHG can be found on page 127.

Notes to the single total figure table

Fixed pay

   Salary: salary paid for the year. Salary increases in 2023 were 
lower than the budget for the wider UK and US corporate 
workforce. See pages 126 to 127 for information on Executive 
Director changes during 2023.

   Benefits: for Executive Directors, this includes, but is not 
limited to, taxable benefits such as company car or allowance 
and healthcare.

As disclosed on page 126, to facilitate Elie Maalouf to carry 
out his UK-based role whilst maintaining his US home and IHG’s 
significant business, government and industry interests in the US, 
he also receives a net amount of £10,000 per month towards UK 
housing costs. The 2023 benefits figure for Elie also includes 
travel and accommodation costs in relation to his relocation.

   Pension benefit: for current Executive Directors, in line with 
the DR Policy, includes the value of IHG contributions and any 
cash allowances paid in lieu of pension contributions.

Elie Maalouf and Michael Glover both relocated to the UK for their 
Group CEO and Group CFO roles; they did not participate in the 
IHG UK pension plan in 2023 and instead received cash allowances 
of 12% of salary. Keith Barr and Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson also did 
not participate in any IHG pension plan in 2023 for their respective 
periods of employment and instead received cash allowances of 
12% of base salary. This is in line with the maximum level available 
to all other participants in the UK pension plan. 

Life assurance cover for all Executive Directors was provided 
at four times base salary.

Elie Maalouf participated in the US 401(k) Plan and the US Deferred 
Compensation Plan (DCP) for the period 1 January to 30 June 2023 
whilst in his role as CEO, Americas. The US 401(k) Plan is a 
tax-qualified plan providing benefits on a defined contribution 
basis, with the member and company both contributing. 

Contributions made by, and in respect of, Elie Maalouf in these 
plans for the year ended 31 December 2023 were:

of salary matched contribution (subject to IRS limits in respect of 
401(k) contributions) and a 16% of salary supplemental employer 
DCP contribution.

Other
Elie Maalouf received a net payment of £50,000 in July 2023 to 
cover the transitional and transactional costs of setting up a UK 
base. The value of this one-off payment has been grossed up for 
disclosure in the single total figure of remuneration table above.

Michael Glover received a gross payment of £150,000 to cover

Operation
Disclosed award levels are determined based on salary as at 
31 December 2023, other than for Elie Maalouf whose award was 
pro-rated based on his respective salaries and periods as CEO, 
Americas and Group CEO, and on a straight-line basis between 
threshold and target, and target and maximum, and are based 
on achievement vs target under each measure:

to be an award in relation to that measure; subject to Committee 
discretion, no award is made for achievement below threshold;

•  target is the target level of achievement and results in a target 

award for that measure; and

•  maximum is the level of achievement at which a maximum 

award for that measure is received (capped at 200% of salary).

The Committee formally reviews performance against IHG’s 
Global Metrics as part of the APP structure in considering 
whether to apply discretion to adjust outcomes on the strategic 
measures. Any application of discretion to the APP outcome, 
would be disclosed in the relevant year’s Directors’ Remuneration 
Report.

For Executive Directors, 50% of the 2023 APP award will be 
made in the form of shares, deferred for three years, subject 
to continued employment.

APP outcome for 2023
The performance measures for the 2023 APP were determined 
in accordance with the DR Policy and were:

•  operating profit from reportable segments (70%);

•  room signings (15%); and

•  room openings (15%).

Target award was 115% of salary and maximum was up to 200% 
of target for each measure, subject to an overall cap on the award 
of 200% of salary. The following chart and table shows threshold, 
target and maximum opportunity, as well as weighting and actual

target set at the start of the year.

Awards are made annually and eligible executives will receive 
shares at the end of the cycle, subject to achievement of the 
three-year performance conditions. These conditions and 
weightings are described on page 130.

TSR measures the return to shareholders by investing in IHG 
relative to a comparator group containing the following major 
globally branded competitors: Accor S.A., Choice Hotels 
International Inc., Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., Hyatt Hotels 
Corporation, Marriott International Inc., Melia Hotels International 
S.A., NH Hotels Group, and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc., 
as per data provided by our corporate bankers sourced from 
Refinitiv Datastream. Maximum payout is for upper quartile 
relative performance, and threshold is median of the 
comparator group. 

Any use of discretion, including the factors influencing the decision, 
will be clearly communicated in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year in which the decision is made.

The share price in respect of the 2020/22 LTIP cycle has been 
restated using the volume weighted average price of 5,467p 
for all Executive Directors on the date of actual vesting on 
22 February 2023. The corresponding values shown in the 2022 
report (prior to the actual vesting) were an estimate calculated 
using an average share price over the final quarter of 2022 
of 4,687p.

Adjustments to absolute cash flow outcome
Over the performance period of the 2021/23 LTIP award, there have been events 
that have impacted IHG’s cash flow that were unquantified or unforeseen when 
the original targets were set. In line with the adjustments reported in previous 
Directors’ Remuneration Reports, the table opposite shows the reconciliation 
between reported cash flow and the outcome for the 2021/23 LTIP. This includes 
adjustments agreed by the Committee to exclude the impact of the exit from 
Russia, as described on page 128 of the 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
and consider adjustment for the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza quality review to 
the extent the final programme differed from what was reflected in the LTIP target. 
These adjustments had no effect on the vesting outcome.

Adjustment to other measures
As disclosed in the 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report, IHG announced the decision to cease all operations in Russia. Net system 
size growth performance for IHG and all companies in the peer set for this relative measure has been adjusted to remove the Russia 
system size from all companies for all years. The formulaic NSSG LTIP outcome also includes an adjustment to exclude room removals 
incremental to our normal level due to the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza estate review in 2021.

These events were not budgeted for at the time of setting the 2021/23 targets, and the Committee, in its judgement, considered it was 
appropriate to adjust for them on the basis of its view that LTIP participants should not have been disincentivised from making these 
decisions in the long-term interest of shareholders. 

The Committee considered performance against the ROCE underpin. The underpin level of 20% was met, with the final ROCE average 
of the three years being 23.7%, therefore the Committee did not need to consider adjusting the NSSG vesting level in respect of this.

a  Following a disclosure of this measure in the 2023 DR Policy, a calculation error was identified in the configuration of one aspect of the target for this metric. The Committee 

has agreed to the correction of this mathematical error, which means the threshold and maximum targets for this metric are as disclosed above. It is important to note that this 
correction, resulting from a technical modelling error in incentive plan target configuration, does not alter the intended level of stretch inherent in performance required to 
meet targets as anticipated at the outset, nor does it impact the Company’s wider carbon reduction goals. 

Consideration of discretion
Following Keith Barr’s 30 years with IHG, culminating in serving the last 
six as Group CEO and ensuring a smooth transition to Elie Maalouf 
after stepping down from the Board, the Committee exercised its 
discretion to treat Keith as a ‘good leaver’ for the purpose of his 
unvested share awards. In line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Committee has adopted a robust, formal framework that 
it will use to determine whether to exercise discretion. Some of the 
key factors the Committee considers are shown below. 

Relative importance of spend on pay
The chart below sets out the actual expenditure of the Group

AUDITED

Executive Directors’ shareholdings and share interests
The Committee believes that share ownership by Executive 
Directors and senior executives strengthens the link between 
the individuals’ personal interests and those of shareholders.

   Guideline Executive Director shareholding requirement

Executive Directors are required to hold shares equal to 500% of 
salary for the Chief Executive Officer and any US-based Executive 
Directors, and 300% for other Executive Directors. Executive 
Directors are expected to hold all net shares earned until the 
previous guideline shareholding requirement is achieved (300% 
for the CEO and any US-based Executive Directors, and 200% 
for other Executive Directors) and at least 50% of all subsequent 
net shares earned until the current guideline shareholding is met. 
The number of shares held outright includes all Directors’ 
beneficial interests and those held by their spouses and other 
connected persons. It also includes the net value of unvested 
shares that are not subject to any further performance conditions.

Percentages are calculated using the 29 December 2023 share 
price of 7,090p.

We increased our post-employment shareholding requirement 
with effect from the approval of our current DR Policy, approved 
at the 2023 AGM, so that the full guideline minimum shareholding 
requirement continues for two years post-cessation of employment. 

As part of this requirement, since 2019, shares have been 
granted and all unvested awards held in a nominee account with 
Executive Directors required to electronically sign an agreement 
to the terms of the grant, including the post-employment 
shareholding requirement.

The APP deferred share awards are not subject to additional performance conditions. Details on the performance conditions to which

AUDITED

Payments to past Directors 
Sir Ian Prosser
Sir Ian Prosser, who retired as Director on 31 December 2003, 
had an ongoing healthcare benefit of £1,710 during the year.

Payments for loss of office
Keith Barr
Keith Barr stepped down from the Board of IHG on 30 June 2023. 
A statement to this effect was prepared pursuant to Section 
430(2B) of the CA 2006 and can be found on the IHG PLC 
website. He remained an employee of the Company until 
31 December 2023 and therefore continued to receive salary and 
benefits and remain eligible for a 2023 APP award. The Committee 

exercised its discretion to treat Keith as a ‘good leaver’ for the 
purpose of his unvested share awards, pro-rated to his date of 
leaving for the LTIP and they will continue to vest according to 
the normal vesting schedule for the award. He did not receive a 
grant in the 2023/25 LTIP cycle. IHG also agreed to settle fees of 
£13,850 plus VAT in connection with legal advice to Keith on these 
arrangements. Full details of his arrangements on leaving and the 
use of discretion are shown on pages 126 and 132.

Pension entitlements
No Executive Director is entitled to any Defined Benefit pension 
or related benefit from IHG.

CEO pay ratio 
As we have noted in previous DRRs, pay ratios will differ significantly 
between companies, even within the same industry, depending 
on demographics and business models. The Group’s UK employee 
demographic, which primarily consisted of largely professional, 
management and senior corporate roles, changed in 2019 with the 
addition of a number of hotel employing entities, comprising the 
UK leased estate, which includes a large proportion of part-time 
and flexible-working support and service roles. As per our past 
disclosures, we show the ratio both including and excluding the 
UK hotel employing entities.

The 2018-2022 figures have been restated to reflect the value of the CEO’s LTIP awards on 
the date of actual vesting rather than the estimated vesting levels used in the respective 
years’ DRRs.

What drives the difference in pay between our CEO 
and other employees?
Pay ratios reflect how remuneration arrangements differ as 
responsibility increases for more senior roles within the organisation, 
for example:

•  this is the first year the increased LTIP quantum from the 2020 

DR Policy vests for the CEO, the increase was deferred by a year 
so was not granted at the higher level until 2021. Although there 
was a strong APP outcome for both the CEO and wider corporate 
population, a greater proportion of performance-related variable 
pay and share-based incentives apply for the more senior executives, 
including Executive Directors, who will have a greater degree of 
influence over performance outcomes;

•  role-specific specialist plans apply in certain areas such as 

corporate reservations, sales, hotel development and General 
Managers of IHG managed, owned, leased and managed lease 
hotels. The target and maximum amounts that can be earned 
under these plans are typically a higher percentage of base salary 
for more senior employees, which in turn affect the pay ratio; and

•  incentive plans for other corporate employees are typically based 

on a combination of individual performance and the Group’s 
operating profit from reportable segments.

The increase in ratio since 2020, reflects the strong performance 
of the business and the resulting increases in variable pay outcomes. 
The comparative CEO figure used for calculating this year’s ratio 
included some one-off costs associated with Elie Maalouf’s relocation. 

The population demographics have also had a larger impact than 
in previous years as the full population in 2023 includes a greater 
number of hotel employees than it did in 2022. Overall, on this basis, 
the Company believes the median pay ratio for the relevant financial 
year is consistent with the pay, reward and progression for the 
Company’s UK employees taken as a whole.

Calculation methodology and supporting information
Option C has been selected for the identification of the percentile 
employees. IHG prefer to use this method as we are able to produce 
the most accurate total remuneration figure for all UK employees 
on a basis comparable with the statutory reporting for Executive 
Directors using the most recently available data at the time of 
producing the Annual Report. Specifically, this involves:

•  compiling all monthly payroll data for all UK employees from 

1 January to 31 December 2023 detailing complete variable and 
fixed remuneration, including pension and taxable benefits such 
as company car or allowance and healthcare; and

•  valuing APP for the corporate workforce based on actual 2023 
company performance metrics but only target for the personal 
performance metric, as actual outcomes for this element of the 
award are not known at the time of writing this report, so that it 
reflects as much of the same input as for the CEO data as possible 
at the time of calculation. In practice, personal performance 
outcomes are subject to manager discretion and can be flexed 
between 0-200% of target.

As noted on page 126, we had a change of CEO during 2023, so we 
have used pro-rated salary, benefits, pension and bonus amounts 
for Keith Barr and Elie Maalouf for the respective periods in which 
they were CEO for calculating the pay ratio this year. We have used 
the full value of Keith Barr’s LTIP 2021/23 award, however, as this 
award was granted at the full level available to the CEO as per the 
DR Policy at the time, and we believe it is the most accurate figure 
for this disclosure. 

Option C requires three UK employees to be identified as the 
equivalent of the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile. Having identified 
these employees, the 2023 remuneration is calculated on the same 
basis as the CEO single total figure of remuneration.

The pay arrangements for the six employees, three from the full 
population and three from the population excluding hotel employing 
entities, were reviewed alongside those for the employees ranked 
immediately above and below them to confirm that they were 
representative of pay levels at these quartiles. The 2023 salary and 
total pay for the individuals identified at the lower, median and 
upper quartiles are set out below:

a  The total salary figure used for the 25th percentile for the full population includes  
periods of unpaid absence and the base pay for the year excluding this would have 
been £23,463.23.

In the 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report, we confirmed that 
the Real Living Wage would be applied as a minimum for all staff 
from April 2023 and on reviewing the 25th percentile for this year’s 
ratio, we can see that the annual salary for the 25th percentile (full 
population) following April 2023 merit increases is £24,128. This is 
above the annualised Real Living Wage salary for 2022/23 of £22,672 
(£11.60ph vs £10.90ph).

Fees: Fees are paid in line with the DR Policy. Jill McDonald and Ian Dyson stepped down from the Board on 28 February 2023, so all 
fees and taxable benefits for these Directors ceased on this date. Angie Risley joined the Board on 1 September 2023, so all fees and 
taxable benefits for this Director began on their appointment date.

Benefits: For Non-Executive Directors, benefits include taxable travel and accommodation expenses to attend Board meetings away 
from the designated home location. Under UK income tax legislation, the non-UK based Non-Executive Directors are not subject to tax 
on some travel expenses; this is reflected in the taxable benefits for Deanna Oppenheimer, Duriya Farooqui and Sharon Rothstein.

Other: Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for any incentive awards or for any pension contribution/benefit.

Annual percentage change in remuneration of Directors compared to employees
The table below shows the percentage change in all Directors’ remuneration compared to that of an average employee between the 
financial years ended 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2023.

The 2023 remuneration figures for the Directors are taken from the data used to compile the single total figure of remuneration tables 
shown on pages 128 and 136, excluding any rounding up or down. No employees are directly employed by the Group’s Parent Company, 
so the average employee data for this year’s report is based on the same UK corporate employee population as that on which the CEO pay 
ratio is calculated. 

Elie Maalouf became Group CEO on 1 July 2023 which involved a relocation to the UK. Elie’s salary in the previous year-on-year changes was 
calculated in USD, with the equivalent single total figure table disclosures reported in GBP. From 1 July 2023, Elie’s salary has been in GBP so, 
to reduce any impact of the currency conversion, we are now calculating his percentage change in GBP. This is the currency in which his 
salary, bonus and a large sum of his benefits will be paid going forward, and therefore will provide a more meaningful indication of his 
year-on-year remuneration changes and align further with the intentions of this disclosure.

All corporate employees share the same corporate performance metrics with the Executive Directors; however, the weightings of these 
metrics differ for corporate employees below Executive Committee level and measures include an individual performance portion, the 
results of which are not available at the time of reporting. For average employee data, we assume that target performance is achieved. 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for a bonus.

Taxable benefits for Non-Executive Directors largely comprise of travel expenses whereas, Executive Director and average employee 
taxable benefits typically comprise elements of their reward package, such as company car or allowance and healthcare benefits.

a  Please see notes below for further details on these percentage change anomalies. 

Notes to the annual percentage change in remuneration of Directors compared to employees table
•  No data has been reported for Byron Grote and Deanna Oppenheimer as they both joined the Board during 2022 and therefore only 
part-year data is available, which does not enable a comparison with 2023. Similarly, Michael Glover and Angie Risley both joined the 
Board during 2023, so there will be no full-year data comparisons for them in 2023 and 2024. 

•  Graham Allan was appointed as Chair of the Responsible Business Committee in addition to his role as Senior Non-Executive Director 

from 1 March 2023, so his salary percentage change increase incorporates the base fee increase and the addition of his role supplements.

•  As explained above, Elie Maalouf took on the role of Group CEO on 1 July 2023, therefore his salary percentage change increase 

incorporates his new remuneration package for part of 2023. Elie’s 2023 taxable benefits figure also includes additional relocation costs, 
including a one-off relocation payment and an ongoing housing allowance which were not applicable in 2022. The 2022 vs 2021 
percentage change for Elie has been updated due to the 2022 benefits figure being restated as noted on page 128.

•  In 2023, more in-person Board Meetings were held than in 2022. Graham Allan incurred only £2,016.61 in expenses in 2022 but incurred 
£4,200.55 in 2023, hence the percentage change increase for 2023 vs 2022 is 108%. Similarly, Daniela Barone Soares, Arthur de Haast 
and Duriya Farooqui incurred an additional £734.70, £1,310.10 and £1,370.07 on 2022 figures respectively. As expected, the extreme 
fluctuations shown in percentage change in last year’s disclosure have already begun to reduce and we expect these to even out more 
going forward as Board meetings return to a more regular structure.

•  The bonus outcome for the average employee has fallen by a lower percentage than that of Executive Directors due to the difference 
in weightings for measures and additional budget being made available for the individual performance element for employees below 
Executive Committee level. 

•  Any significant percentage changes in the previous year-on-year changes (2022 vs 2021, 2021 vs 2020 and 2020 vs 2019) are explained

Elie Maalouf is not eligible for a merit increase in 2024 following his appointment as Group CEO on 1 July 2023. Further details regarding 
his appointment can be found on page 126. The increase for the CFO is shown above and is in line with the budget for the wider corporate 
workforce. For Executive Director merit increases, we use a range of considerations including wider workforce merit increases, market data 
and external benchmarking. In addition to FTSE 100 data and other hotel comparators, we use the following US comparator group for CEO 
salary and overall pay benchmarking: Choice Hotels International Inc.; Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.; Hyatt Hotels Corporation; Marriott 
International Inc.; and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc..

Measures for 2024 APP
The 2024 APP structure is in line with the approved DR Policy and will be based on a 70% weighting for a measure of operating profit from 
reportable segments and a 30% weighting for other key strategic measures that are reviewed annually and set in line with business priorities. 
The target award has been reduced from 115% to 100% of salary, and subject to meeting minimum shareholding requirements, up to 70% 
of the award may be paid in cash and at least 30% in deferred shares.

Operating profit from reportable segments is a focal measure of business performance for our shareholders and is a function of other 
critical measures, such as RevPAR, profit margin and fee revenues. The Committee has determined that for 2024, it remains important 
to the Company’s strategic objectives to focus on new room openings and new room signings in the APP. New room openings are critical 
to driving both short- and long-term profitable growth and are a recognised key performance measure across the industry, whilst new room 
signings provide the best gauge of future growth as they create the path for openings in future years, which will, in turn, drive profit and 
revenue growth. The two strategic measures will be evenly weighted, with each worth 15% of the overall APP. The targets are commercially 
sensitive and will be disclosed in the 2024 Annual Report.

Measures and targets for 2024/26 LTIP cycle
For the 2024/26 cycle, we will retain a net system size growth (NSSG) measure reflecting our strategy of accelerating the growth of our 
brands in high-value markets, this will have a relative performance target against our six largest competitors and the weighting for this 
measure will remain at 20%. The cash flow measure to deliver consistent and sustained growth remains in place with a weighting of 20%. 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) continues to make up another 20% of the 2024/26 cycle measures; the TSR comparator group has been 
updated for the 2024/26 cycle. The existing comparator group (up to the 2023/25 LTIP cycle) can be found on page 129 of this report and 
the new TSR comparator group (with effect from the 2024/26 LTIP cycle) can be found within the table below. Alongside the new companies 
that have been added to the group, the existing member NH Hotels has been replaced with its majority shareholder, Minor International.

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was introduced as a balancing measure to TSR with effect from the 2023/25 LTIP cycle, and this will remain 
in place with a 20% weighting as a balance to the more volatile and less controllable TSR measure. Adjusted EPS targets incorporate assumed 
share buybacks as part of our ongoing shareholder return programme, so the Committee would not expect to adjust performance outcomes 
at the end of the performance period for buybacks made during the cycle. Following the introduction of an ESG measure in our 2023/25 
LTIP cycle, we have continued to include ESG in the 2024/26 cycle with a weighting of 20% made up of four equally weighted measures 
based on IHG’s People and Planet goals. Further information, including on the underlying metrics for ESG, can be found on page 140.

The measures for the 2024/26 cycle are as follows:

ESG measures
Our ESG measures for the 2024/26 LTIP cycle are again aligned to the Planet and People aspects of our Journey to Tomorrow responsible 
business plan. The new measures build on the 2023/25 LTIP cycle, with the Planet measures focusing on the ongoing rollout of new Energy 
Conservation Measures (ECMs) in the existing hotel estate as part of our brand standards and the development of hotels that operate at very 
low/zero carbon, a programme for which is expected to launch in 2024. Stretching targets have been set for these metrics, with full payout 
requiring 100% adoption of five ECMs, including in franchise hotels (Scope 3) and 15 new hotels that operate at low/zero carbon open or 
under construction. These are important areas within management control which support the delivery of our long-term carbon and energy 
goals.

The 2024/26 People measures build on and complement our representation measures in the 2023/25 cycle. They are focused on strengthening 
our inclusive culture and talent-driven approach to growth, as part of our commitment to our people. A challenging maximum target has 
been set to level up the average of ‘inclusion index’ scores, an aspect of our employee engagement survey (carried out by an external party), 
for ethnically diverse US and UK corporate and hotel colleagues to be at least in line with those of the respective full employee populations. 
Threshold for this measure has been set after careful consideration of the range of current differences in scores across these respective 
populations. The second People measure for the 2024/26 cycle supports our hotel growth agenda through existing talent intervention 
programmes targeted at developing the next generation of hotel managers. This includes the RISE programme, which aims to increase the 
number of female colleagues in hotel leadership roles across our managed and leased estates. The threshold for this measure is set in line 
with the average post-programme promotion rate for the three years to the end of 2023. The maximum target requires achievement of 
a very stretching 50% promotion rate from the 2022, 2023 and 2024 cohorts of the Journey to GM, Career Insights and RISE programmes 
by the end of the cycle in 2026.

Total Shareholder Return (TSR) comparator group
Our existing TSR comparator group was agreed in 2016 and originally included two additional companies that have since been removed 
due to a merger and delisting. The exit of these from public capital markets, and thus from the comparator group, resulted in a relatively 
small remaining comparator group. As a result, the Committee has made the decision to expand the comparator group from 8 to 15 global 
hotel companies. We believe that this mitigates the potential for the existing comparator group to become smaller due to industry 
consolidation or other factors.

The Committee applied a robust set of filters to select the additions to the comparator group and believe that the broadening of the comparator 
group reflects that IHG has an international footprint; competes with a wide range of hotel peers across the world; and that we have a diverse 
investor base, with some shareholders more focused on European and globally listed businesses, in addition to those with a US-listed 
business focus.

Our Statement of compliance summarises how the Group has 
applied the principles of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code 
(available at frc.org.uk/library/standards-codes-policy/corporate-
governance/uk-corporate-governance-code/ under UK Corporate 
Governance Code) as published in July 2018 (the Code) and 
comments on compliance with the Code’s provisions.

This should be read in conjunction with the Strategic Report 
on pages 2 to 88, and Governance, including the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, on pages 89 to 140, as a whole.

The Board considers that the Group has complied in all material 
respects with the Code’s provisions for the year ended 31 December 
2023, save as noted below in section 5 P (Remuneration policies and 
practices) in respect of provision 38.

1.   Board Leadership and Company Purpose

E.  Workforce policies and practices

A.  The role of the Board

The Board continues to lead the Group’s strategic direction and 
long-term objectives. Further responsibilities of the Board are set 
out on page 100.

The Board met eight times during 2023 and all Directors continue 
to act in what they consider to be the best interests of the Company, 
consistent with their statutory duties. Further details of 2023 Board 
meetings, including information on matters discussed and decisions 
taken by the Board, are set out on pages 101 to 103; attendance 
information is on page 96; and skills and experience and 
biographical information is on pages 92 to 95.

A description of IHG’s business model is set out on pages 10 to 13. 
An assessment of the principal risks facing the Group is included on 
pages 42 to 49.

Potential conflicts of interest are reviewed annually and powers of 
authorisation are exercised in accordance with the Companies Act 
and the Company’s Articles of Association.

During the year, if any Director has unresolved concerns about the 
operation of the Board or the management of the Company, these 
would be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

B.  The Company’s purpose, values and strategy

Our purpose is to provide True Hospitality for Good. A description 
of our culture, including an overview of our values and information 
on how the Board ensures alignment between our purpose, 
values and strategy and our culture, is included on pages 38 to 41. 
A summary of the Board’s activities in relation to the Voice of the 
Employee is included on page 113. Information on the Group’s 
approach to rewarding its workforce is contained on pages 29 to 30 
and 123 and 124.

C.  Resources

The Board delegates oversight of the allocation of day-to-day resources 
to management (principally through the Executive Committee).

Information on the Group’s key performance indicators, including 
the measures used to monitor them, is included on pages 60 to 63.

A summary of the procedures for identifying and discussing emerging 
risks is set out on pages 42 to 49.

D.  Shareholders and stakeholders

The Board engaged actively throughout 2023 with shareholders 
and other stakeholders. The Chair held a number of meetings with 
major institutional shareholders to discuss the role of the Board and 
other general governance issues, following which the Chair ensured 
that their views were communicated to the Board as a whole. 
The (then) Chair of the Remuneration Committee also engaged 
extensively with shareholders during the year. Further details are 
on page 125.

Information on the Board’s consideration of and engagement with 
other stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, hotel owners 
and guests, is included on pages 36 and 37.

The Board has overarching responsibility for the Group’s workforce 
policies and practices and delegates day-to-day responsibility to 
the CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer to ensure that they 
are consistent with the Company’s values and support its 
long-term success.

Employees are able to report matters of concern confidentially 
through our Confidential Disclosure Channel. The Board routinely 
reviews reports generated from the disclosures and ensures that 
arrangements are in place for investigation and follow-up action 
as appropriate.

2.  Division of Responsibilities

F.  The Chair

Deanna Oppenheimer leads the operation and governance of the 
Board and its Committees. The Chair has been in post since 
September 2022 and was independent on appointment.

G.  Board composition

The size and composition of the Board and its Committees are kept 
under review by the Nomination Committee to ensure the appropriate 
combination of Executive and Non-Executive Directors. Details of 
the composition of the Board and Committees are available on 
pages 92 to 96.

At least half of the Board, excluding the Chair, are Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Provision 10 of the Code considers the 
independence of Non-Executive Directors and circumstances that 
might impair their independence, including holding office for over 
nine years. Jo Harlow reached a nine-year tenure in September 
2023, before retiring from the Board on 31 December 2023. In light 
of Jo’s role as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, the Board 
considered a slight extension to her nine-year tenure as appropriate 
to facilitate an orderly transition to Angie Risley, who succeeded Jo 
as Chair of the Remuneration Committee from 1 January 2024.

The Board carefully considered Jo’s contributions and commitments 
in light of her extended tenure, and concluded that she remained 
independent.

H.  Non-Executives

Non-Executive Director terms of appointment outline IHG’s time 
commitment expectations required to fulfil their role.

The commitments of each Director are included in the Directors’ 
biographical details on pages 92 to 95. Details of Non-Executive 
Director appointment terms are set out on page 125.

The Chair annually reviews the time each Non-Executive Director 
dedicates to IHG as part of the performance evaluation of Directors 
(see page 106) and is satisfied that their other duties and time 
commitments do not conflict with those as Directors.

Graham Allan is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID). 
The SID provides a sounding board for the Chair and serves as an 
intermediary for the other Directors and shareholders. Graham also 
led the annual performance review of the Chair (see page 106).

After each Board meeting, Non-Executive Directors and the Chair 
meet without Executive Directors being present.

independent advice and other necessary resources, at the Company’s 
expense. They receive the administrative and logistical support of 
a full-time executive assistant. 

3.  Composition, Succession and Evaluation

J.  Appointments

Appointments to the Board are led by the Nomination Committee 
in accordance with its Terms of Reference (available on our website

planning for the Board and senior management. Further details of 
the role of the Nomination Committee and what it did in 2023 are 
in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 114 and 115.

The overall process of appointment and removal of Directors is 
overseen by the Board as a whole.

All of the Directors retire and seek election or re-election at each AGM.

K.  Skills

Details of the skills, experience and biographical information of the 
Board are set out on pages 92 to 95.

The Chair and Company Secretary ensure that new Directors receive 
a full induction, and that all Directors continually update their skills 
and have the requisite knowledge and familiarity with the Group to 
fulfil their role (see page 104).

The length of service of Non-Executive Directors is reviewed regularly.

L.  Annual evaluation

The Board undertakes either an internal or external annual Board 
effectiveness evaluation. In 2023, the Board undertook an external 
evaluation. Details of the process and results of the evaluation are 
included on pages 104 to 106.

Performance evaluations of Directors, including the Chair, are also 
carried out on an annual basis. Directors’ biographies are set out on 
pages 92 to 95, and details of performance evaluations carried out 
in 2023 are on page 106.

4.  Audit, Risk and Internal Control

M.  Audit functions

The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors (see page 96 for membership details).

Byron Grote, the Audit Committee’s Chair, has recent and relevant 
financial experience, and the Committee as a whole has 
competence relevant to the sector in which we operate. Details of 
the Committee’s role, responsibilities and activities are set out on 
pages 107 to 111.

The Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
Internal Audit function and also assessed PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP’s performance during 2023, including its independence, 
effectiveness and objectivity. Details of these reviews are set out 
in the Audit Committee Report on pages 107 to 109.

The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities (including the Board’s 
statement confirming that it considers that the Annual Report and 
Form 20-F, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s position, performance, business model and strategy) 
is set out on page 144.

The status of IHG as a going concern is set out in the Directors’ 
Report on page 241. An explanation of the Group’s performance, 
business model, strategy and the risks and uncertainties relating to 
IHG’s prospects, including the viability of the Group, is set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 2 to 88.

O.  Risk management

The Board determines the nature and extent of the principal risks 
the organisation is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives. 
The Board completed an assessment of the principal and emerging 
risks facing the Group during the year, including those risks that 
would threaten the Group’s business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity and reputation (see pages 42 to 49 for further 
details of the principal risks). The Board and Audit Committee 
monitor the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems 
and conduct an annual review of their effectiveness. Throughout the 
year, the Board has directly, and through delegated authority to the 
Executive Committee and the Audit Committee, overseen and 
reviewed all material controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls. See pages 42 to 49 and 107 to 109.

5.  Remuneration

P.  Remuneration policies and practices

The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy 
on executive remuneration and determining remuneration packages 
of Directors and senior management. The Directors’ Remuneration 
Report is set out on pages 116 to 140. Details of the Remuneration 
Committee’s focus areas during 2023 are set out on page 125 and 
its membership details are on pages 96 and 118.

Provision 38 of the Code states that pension contribution rates for 
executive Directors should be aligned with those available to the 
workforce. As explained in the Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019, 
this was to be the case for new UK appointments and (then) existing 
UK Executive Directors from January 2023. US retirement benefit 
arrangements differ in a number of ways from the UK and include 
a Deferred Compensation Plan for senior employees.

Given the importance of the CEO, Americas’ role to the business and 
the market competitiveness concerns over Executive Director pay, 
the arrangements as they related to Elie Maalouf in his role as CEO, 
Americas were maintained up to the end of his tenure in that role on 
30 June 2023. With effect from 1 July 2023, Elie was promoted to 
Group CEO and transferred to a UK pension basis. As such, effective 
from 1 July 2023, the pension arrangements for Executive Directors 
are now in line with Provision 38 of the Code. Further details can be 
found on pages 123 and 126.

Q.  Procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration

Details of how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (DR Policy) was 
implemented in 2023 are set out on pages 128 to 137.

During 2023, no individual Director was involved in deciding his 
or her own remuneration outcome.

R. 

Independent judgement and discretion
The Remuneration Committee has formal discretions in place in 
relation to outcomes under the Deferred Award Plan rules, and these 
are disclosed as part of the DR Policy. When determining outcomes 
under incentive plans, the Committee considers whether it is 
appropriate to adjust outcomes under these discretions, taking 
account of the Group’s performance, relative performance against 
competitors and other relevant factors. Information on the 
Remuneration Committee’s consideration of the use of discretion 
during 2023 is set out on page 132.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities

Financial Statements and accounting records 
The Directors are required to prepare the Annual Report and Form 
20-F and the Financial Statements for the Company and the Group 
at the end of each financial year in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. Under company law, directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group 
and the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The Directors have 
prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with 
UK-adopted international accounting standards and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). The Company Financial 
Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK accounting 
standards, comprising Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ (‘FRS 101’), and applicable law.

In preparing these Financial Statements, IHG Directors are required to: 

•  select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently; 

•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable; 

•  state whether the Consolidated Financial Statements have 

been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards;

•  state for the Company Financial Statements whether applicable 

UK accounting standards, comprising FRS 101, have been 
followed; and 

•  prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 

unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the 
Group will continue in business.

The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company 
and the Group keep adequate accounting records sufficient to 
show and explain the Company’s and the Group’s transactions, and 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the 
Company and the Group to enable them to ensure that the Financial 
Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. 

The Directors are also responsible for the system of internal control, 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group, and 
taking reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.

Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
The Board confirms that to the best of its knowledge: 

•  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 

accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, 
and IFRSs as issued by the IASB, and give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group 
taken as a whole;

•  The Company Financial Statements have been prepared in 

accordance with UK accounting standards, comprising FRS 101, 
and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial 
position of the Company; and

•  The Annual Report, including the Strategic Report, includes a 

fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces. 

UK Corporate Governance Code 
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers 
that this Annual Report and Form 20-F, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and that it provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s and the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

Disclosure of information to Auditor 
The Directors who held office as at the date of approval of this 
report confirm that they have taken steps to make themselves aware 
of relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418(3) of the 
Companies Act 2006). None of the Directors are aware of any 
relevant audit information that has not been disclosed to the 
Company’s and Group’s Auditor.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting for the Group, as defined in 
Rule 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRSs. 

The Group’s internal control over financial reporting includes 
policies and procedures that: 

•  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 

accurately and fairly reflect the Group’s transactions and 
dispositions of assets; 

•  are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions 

are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards and IFRSs as issued by the 
IASB, and that receipts and expenditure are being made only in 
accordance with authorisation of management and the Directors 
of the Company; and 

•  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 

detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Group’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Any internal control framework has inherent limitations and 
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness 
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control over financial reporting at 
31 December 2023 based on criteria established in the Internal 
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). 

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as 
at 31 December 2023 the Group’s internal control over financial 
reporting was effective. 

During the period covered by this document there were no changes 
in the Group’s internal control over financial reporting that have 
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the 
effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting. 

The Group’s internal control over financial reporting at 31 December 
2023, together with the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements, 
were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent 
registered public accounting firm. Their auditor’s report can be 
found on page 151.

Independent auditors’ report to the members 
of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC 

Report on the audit of the Financial Statements

Opinion
In our opinion:

•  InterContinental Hotels Group PLC’s Group Financial Statements 

and Parent Company Financial Statements (the “Financial 
Statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the Parent Company’s affairs at 31 December 2023 and 
of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;

•  the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006;

•  the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and 
applicable law); and

•  the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 

the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the Financial Statements, included within the 
Annual Report and Form 20-F (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the Group and Parent Company statements of financial 
position at 31 December 2023; the Group income statement, Group 
statement of comprehensive income, Group statement of cash flows 
and Group and Parent Company statements of changes in equity for 
the year then ended; the accounting policies; and the notes to the 
Financial Statements.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in the accounting policies, the Group, in addition to 
applying UK-adopted international accounting standards, has also 
applied international financial reporting standards (“IFRSs”) as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).

In our opinion, the Group Financial Statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the auditors’ 
responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of 
our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Financial 
Statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as 
applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in note 5 to the Group Financial 
Statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Parent 
Company or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.

Our audit approach
Overview

•  PwC component audit teams were engaged to perform a full 

scope audit in the US and specified procedures over transactions 
processed at the Group’s Global Business Service Centre in India. 
The Group audit team carried out audit procedures over the

centrally. The territories where we conducted audit procedures,

revenue; 85% of the Group’s statutory profit before tax; and 78% 
of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items and 
the System Fund.

•  The Group audit team performed substantive procedures over all 
of the material balances and transactions of the Parent Company.

Key audit matters
•  Breakage assumption used to estimate IHG One Rewards deferred 

revenue (Group)

•  Allocation of expenses to the System Fund (Group)

•  Recognition of the UK deferred tax asset (Group and Parent Company)

Materiality
•  Overall Group materiality: $48.0 million (2022: $37.0 million) based 
on approximately 5% of profit before tax adjusted for exceptional 
items and the System Fund

•  Overall Parent Company materiality: £21.9 million (2022: £14.8 million) 

based on approximately 1% of net assets

•  Performance materiality: $36.0 million (2022: $27.7 million) (Group) 

and £16.4 million (2022: £11.1 million) (Parent Company)

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed 
the risks of material misstatement in the Financial Statements.
