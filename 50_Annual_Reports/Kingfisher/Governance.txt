1.  During the year the Group entered into two new £50m bilateral term loans with a maturity tenor of two years. Both loans were fully drawn at 31 January 2023.

As at 31 January 2023, the Group had an undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF) of £550m due to expire in May 2025.

The terms of the committed RCF and term loans require that the ratio of Group operating profit (excluding adjusting items) to net 
interest payable (excluding interest on IFRS 16 lease liabilities) must be no less than 3:1 for the preceding 12 months as at the half and 
full year-ends. At 31 January 2023, Kingfisher was in compliance with this requirement.

The fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows arising from the instruments and adjusted for credit risk. These fair

24  Derivatives continued

All the derivatives held by the Group at fair value are considered to have fair values determined by level 2 inputs as defined by the 
fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, representing significant observable inputs other than quoted prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements nor have there been any transfers of 
assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.

At 31 January 2023, net financing derivative assets included in net debt amount to £2m (2021/22: £3m liability).

Cash flow hedges
Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge currency exposures of forecast inventory purchases. At 31 January 2023 the Sterling 
equivalent amount of such contracts is £1,276m (2021/22: £1,236m). These are located in the derivative asset and derivative liability 
lines in the consolidated balance sheet with carrying amounts of £16m asset and £52m liability. The associated fair value gains and 
losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases occur during the next 18 months. The amount recognised in other 
comprehensive income during the year is a gain of £58m (2021/22: £59m gain). Gains of £117m (2021/22: £16m loss) have been 
transferred to inventories for contracts which matured during the year. During the year, gains of £5m (2021/22: £nil) have been 
transferred to the income statement due to ineffectiveness arising from differences in timing and amount of forecast transactions 
relating to foreign currency inventory purchases. The weighted average hedged rates for derivatives outstanding at  
31 January 2023 for our material currencies are EUR/USD 1.07 and GBP/USD 1.22.

Hedge effectiveness is assessed at the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis to ensure that an economic 
relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical 
terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item. The Group performs a qualitative and, where 
necessary, a quantitative assessment of effectiveness.

For foreign currency inventory purchases, ineffectiveness may arise if the timing or amount of the forecast transaction changes 
from what was originally estimated or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty. Foreign 
currency basis spread of the derivative has been excluded from the hedge designation. The non-designated element is immediately 
recognised in the income statement. The amount is immaterial in both years.

Non-designated hedges
The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge against fluctuations in the income statement arising from balance 
sheet positions. At 31 January 2023, the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is £481m (2021/22: £852m). These have not 
been accounted for as hedges, since the fair value movements of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslation 
of the balance sheet positions. These include short-term foreign exchange contracts.

The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for embedded derivatives and none of these contracts has any embedded derivatives 
which are not closely related to the host contract and therefore the Group is not required to account for these separately.

The Group enters into netting agreements with counterparties to manage the credit and settlement risks associated with  
over-the-counter derivatives. These netting agreements and similar arrangements generally enable the Group and its counterparties 
to settle cash flows on a net basis and set-off liabilities against available assets in the event that either party is unable to fulfil its 
contractual obligations.

150 Kingfisher 2022/23 Annual Report and Accounts

Strategic ReportGovernanceFinancial StatementsNet investment hedges
Foreign currency denominated lease liabilities recognised on the adoption of IFRS 16 are designated as hedging the exposure to 
movements in the spot retranslation of the Group’s investment in foreign subsidiaries. The gains and losses on retranslation of the 
hedging instruments are presented in the translation reserve within other reserves to offset gains and losses on the hedged balance 
sheet exposure. The nominal values of these lease liabilities is £197m (2021/22: £166m). The amount recognised in the translation 
reserve is a loss of £3m (2021/22: £1m loss). There is no ineffectiveness for 2022/23. The cumulative total amount recognised in 
the translation reserve in relation to net investment hedges is a loss of £112m (2021/22: £109m).

25  Financial risk management

Kingfisher’s treasury function has primary responsibility for managing certain financial risks to which the Group is exposed. The Board 
reviews the levels of exposure regularly and approves treasury policies covering the use of financial instruments required to manage 
these risks. Kingfisher’s treasury function is not run as a profit centre and does not enter into any transactions for speculative purposes.

In the normal course of business, the Group uses financial instruments including derivatives. The main types of financial instruments 
used are fixed term debt, bank loans and deposits, money market funds, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.

Interest rate risk
Borrowings arranged at floating rates of interest expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at fixed 
rates of interest expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain 
interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable on the Group’s underlying debt instruments.

Currency risk
The Group’s principal currency exposures are to the Euro, US Dollar, Polish Zloty and Romanian Leu. The Euro, Polish Zloty and 
Romanian Leu exposures are operational and arise through the ownership of retail businesses in France, Spain, Portugal, the 
Republic of Ireland, Poland and Romania.

In particular, the Group generates a substantial part of its profit from the Eurozone and, as such, is exposed to the economic 
uncertainty of its member states. The Group continues to monitor potential exposures and risks and consider effective risk 
management solutions.

It is the Group’s policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings into Sterling. In addition, the Group has significant 
transactional exposure arising on the purchase of inventories denominated in US Dollars, which it hedges using forward foreign 
exchange contracts. Under Group policies, the Group’s operating companies are required to hedge committed inventory 
purchases and a proportion of forecast inventory purchases arising in the next 18 months. This is monitored on an ongoing basis.

The Group also has exposure to certain leases denominated in currencies which are different from the functional (reporting) 
currencies of the lessee. To reduce the Group’s exposure to this, most of the affected lease liabilities have been designated as 
net investment hedges of Group assets held in the same currency.

Kingfisher’s policy is to manage the interest rate and currency profile of its debt and cash using derivative contracts. The effect of 
these contracts on the Group’s net debt is as follows:

25  Financial risk management continued

Financial instruments principally affected by interest rate and currency risks, being the significant market risks impacting Kingfisher, 
are borrowings, deposits and derivatives. The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of net finance costs (reflecting the impact 
on profit) and derivative cash flow hedges (reflecting the impact on other comprehensive income) to changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates.

Due to the Group’s hedging arrangements and offsetting foreign currency assets and liabilities, there is no significant impact on profit 
from the retranslation of financial instruments.

The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash flow hedges results from retranslation of forward purchases of US Dollars 
used to hedge forecast US Dollar purchases of inventories. The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity until the 
purchases occur. See note 24 for further details.

The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payables 
and receivables, due to the low associated sensitivity, and are before the effect of tax. It has been prepared on the basis that the 
Group’s debt, hedging activities, hedge accounting designations, and foreign currency proportion of debt and derivative contracts 
remain constant, reflecting the positions at 31 January 2023 and 31 January 2022 respectively. As a consequence, the analysis relates 
to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended. In preparing the sensitivity analysis it is 
assumed that all hedges are fully effective.

The effects shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

152 Kingfisher 2022/23 Annual Report and Accounts

Strategic ReportGovernanceFinancial StatementsLiquidity risk
The Group regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities required to fund its activities. This involves preparing a prudent cash 
flow forecast for the medium term, determining the level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning for repayment of 
debt at its maturity and identifying an appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve against unexpected outflows and/or 
unexpected impacts to cash inflows.

At 31 January 2023, the Group had an undrawn revolving credit facility of £550m due to expire in May 2025.

The following table analyses the Group’s financial liabilities and derivatives into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining 
period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows (including interest) and as such may differ from the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.
