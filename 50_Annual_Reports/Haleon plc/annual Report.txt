Driving growth 
through innovation

In 2023, we launched 68 new innovations, including Sensodyne 
Pronamel Active Shield and Sensodyne Sensitivity & Gum, 
which were named as the top two innovations in the US 
toothpaste market. New packaging innovations included 
Otrivin Nasal Mist, which dispenses a fine mist to bring 
greater comfort to consumers.

Evolving into an agile 
consumer health company

During 2023, Haleon introduced a three-year productivity programme. 
We took proactive steps to streamline the business by optimising 
our processes and structures, and removing duplication across 
functions. This is expected to deliver annualised gross 
cost savings of c.£300m, largely in 2024 and 2025.

Health inclusivity

During 2023, in line with our purpose and responsible business 
goals, we leveraged our brands to empower over 41m people 
globally by helping to break down the barriers to health inclusivity 
for marginalised groups. For example, our ‘Advil Pain Equity Project’ 
in the US championed equitable and accessible pain relief, 
by highlighting pain inequity in Black communities.

Proactively managing 
our portfolio

To reduce complexity across the business, we disposed of Lamisil 
for £235m and recently announced the disposal of ChapStick for 
$430m. This included receiving a passive minority stake in Suave 
Brands Company (valued at $80m at the time of the transaction), 
allowing Haleon to derive long-term value creation from ChapStick. 
We also reached a licensing agreement with Futura Medical to 
exclusively commercialise the first FDA approved topical 
erectile dysfunction treatment for OTC use in the US.

Chair’s 
statement

Sir Dave Lewis
Chair

2023: a year of delivering everyday 
health with humanity
2023 marked our first full calendar year 
as a standalone business, during which 
we made good progress in establishing 
our position as a world-leading global 
consumer health company, with strong 
foundations to support long-term growth.

While we recognise we have much 
more to achieve, it was good to see 
the business demonstrate continued 
momentum. We delivered meaningful 
progress across all elements of our 
strategy to drive sustainable growth and 
shareholder returns, giving us confidence 
that we are on the right course to achieve 
medium and long-term success.

The transformation into a global 
consumer health company continues 
and the Board and I were encouraged 
by visits to Haleon’s regional operations. 
The opportunities ahead of Haleon 
are significant.

Strong financial performance
Haleon’s financial performance is 
driven by deep human understanding 
and investment in trusted science, 
coupled with strong execution and 
financial discipline.

By harnessing these competitive 
advantages, Haleon achieved organic 
revenue growth of 8.0% (reported 4.1%), 
ahead of our medium-term guidance. 
Adjusted operating profit at constant 
currency also grew strongly at 10.4% 
(reported operating profit +9.4%). 

Consistent with the priorities set out 
at the time of listing, we have rapidly 
de-levered to 3.0x net debt/adjusted 
EBITDA as at 31 December 2023. Strong 
cash generation enabled us to accelerate 
debt repayment and we now expect to 
operate at leverage of around 2.5x over 
the medium-term. This underpinned our 
decision to announce a capital allocation 
of £500m for share buybacks in 2024.

Dividend
The Board is proposing a total dividend of 
6.0p per ordinary share which represents 
a pay-out ratio of approximately 35% of 
2023 adjusted earnings. This includes a 
final dividend of 4.2p per ordinary share.

In line with our capital allocation 
priorities to invest for growth, explore 
acquisitions and return surplus capital 
to shareholders, our current intention 
is to grow the dividend at least inline 
with adjusted earnings. 

Importance of governance, 
purpose and culture
One of my priorities as Chair is to ensure 
Haleon’s continued commitment to good 
corporate governance, which supports 
both our purpose and culture.

During 2023, we actively engaged with, 
and responded to, UK regulatory 
consultations on corporate governance, 
reporting and disclosure reforms. 

Our first digitally enabled AGM was held 
in April 2023. We will continue to embrace 
technology to maximise participation, 
and will broadcast this year’s AGM from 
Haleon’s offices in London.

We also embedded the Environmental 
& Social Sustainability Committee, 
which is focused on providing oversight 
and effective governance over Haleon’s 
environmental and social sustainability 
agenda, and the external governance 
and regulatory requirements relevant to 
these areas. This included approving a 
baseline year update for our virgin 
plastic and Scope 3 carbon reduction 
goals from 2020 to 2022, to align with 
better data availability and accuracy.

Further progress was also made in 
ensuring that our growth correlates with 
our sustainability goals. For example, 
70% of packaging for Haleon products 
is recycle-ready, so we remain on track to 
make all packaging recyclable or reusable 
by 2030. We have also taken steps to 
further enhance our safeguards around 
modern slavery and the protection of 
human rights, as they relate to Haleon’s 
operations around the world. 

In terms of building our culture, we 
continued to embed our diversity, 
equity and inclusion (DEI) principles 
across the business, with a focus on 
ethnicity and gender.

Priorities for 2024
The Board considers the following to 
be our priorities for the year ahead:

 — Increasing agility and productivity 
across the business, by continuing 
to optimise and evolve existing 
processes and structures. 

 — Driving performance quality, by 
focusing on the strategic pillars 
which underpin our business.

 — Creating shareholder value through 

effective capital allocation to 
maximise shareholder returns.

 — Continued focus on strong corporate 
governance and ethical behaviours.

Thank you
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank the Executive Team and all Haleon 
employees globally for their hard work 
throughout the year. Their dedication has 
enabled the business to achieve strong 
financial performance, while delivering 
on our strategic objectives and building 
strong foundations for the future. 

While we are pleased with the progress 
made to date, we look forward to building 
on these foundations and delivering 
on future growth opportunities in 2024, 
and beyond.

Officer’s  
review

Strategic Report

Brian McNamara
Chief Executive Officer

Building a track-record for growth
I am very pleased with Haleon’s 
performance in 2023, which despite the 
challenging economic backdrop, saw 
Haleon deliver strong financial results; 
a testament to the strength of our 
category-leading brands.

During the year, we advanced our ambition 
to become more dynamic and agile, driven 
by our purpose to deliver better everyday 
health with humanity. As I reflect on 
2023 and look to 2024 and beyond, I am 
confident about our ability to continue 
building a business that creates value 
for all our stakeholders. 

Our strategy is delivering 
In 2023, we delivered organic revenue 
growth of 8.0% (reported 4.1%), and 
adjusted operating profit growth of 10.4% 
at constant currency (reported operating 
profit +9.4%). Importantly, this was 
underpinned by growth in both price 
and volume, reflecting the quality and 
resilience of our brands. Haleon continued 
to drive consumer preference, with 58% of 
our brands maintaining or growing market 
share. We also maintained our attractive 
financial profile, delivering free cash flow 
of £1.6bn, enabling us to de-lever faster 
than expected to 3.0x leverage as at 
31 December 2023.

Strong delivery against 
strategic pillars
Our four strategic pillars underpin our 
growth ambitions. Highlights last 
year included: 

 — Increasing household penetration, 
with market share gains for many 
of our category-leading brands. 
Sensodyne performed well, as more 
consumers sought the therapeutic 
benefits of the brand’s sensitivity 
toothpastes. For example, Sensodyne 
Sensitivity & Gum and Sensodyne 
Pronamel Active Shield were named 
as the top two innovations in the US 
toothpaste market. Panadol also 
performed well, boosted by 
addressing specialist need states 
such as migraine and body pain.

 — Capitalising on new and emerging 
opportunities, by innovating and 
delivering our brands to more consumers 
in more markets, and increasing channel 
penetration. For example, we expanded 
the Centrum global footprint by entering 
new markets in Sweden, the Middle East 
and Africa. Our e-commerce sales also 
grew, increasing 17% over the year to 
account for 10% of total sales globally.

 — Maintaining strong execution and 
financial discipline, with operating 
profit growing ahead of revenue 
growth in 2023, delivering margin 
expansion at constant currency and 
positive operational leverage.

 — Running a responsible business, with 
the business making good progress 
against its ethical standards, 
environmental and health inclusivity 
goals. During 2023, we empowered over 
41m people to be more included in 
opportunities for better everyday health. 
We met our aim for producing 1bn 
recycle-ready toothpaste tubes two 
years ahead of schedule and were 
recognised by the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index Europe 2023. 
We also progressed our Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion (DEI) ambitions, 
including the launch of our diverse 
talent programme.

Building a more agile and 
dynamic business
We are focused on ensuring that Haleon 
is best placed to deliver consistent 
outperformance over the long-term. As an 
independent company, we have a unique 
opportunity to re-evaluate how the 
business operates, ensuring we deliver 
as effectively and efficiently as possible. 

Our three-year productivity programme 
is on track, delivering efficiencies and 
greater agility, while supporting continued 
investment. The programme is expected 
to result in gross annualised cost savings 
of c.£300m, largely in 2024 and 2025, with 
around one third of the benefit expected 
in 2024 and the remainder in 2025.

We also continue to actively manage our 
portfolio, exploring opportunities for 
divestments and bolt-on acquisitions that 
offer strategic and commercial benefits.

Recent examples include the completion 
of the Lamisil disposal in October 2023 
and the disposal of ChapStick announced 
in January 2024. These divestments 
allow us to reduce complexity and 
focus on higher growth brands, while 
providing optionality in capital allocation, 
consistent with the allocation of £500m 
for share buybacks in 2024, announced 
with full-year results.

Changes to our leadership team
During the year, we continued to 
build our Executive Team to ensure the 
right mix of capabilities and experience to 
drive Haleon’s future growth and success. 
Namrata Patel was appointed as Chief 
Supply Chain Officer, together with 
Ed Petter as Chief Corporate Affairs 
Officer, and Björn Timelin as Head of 
Strategy. Each bring strong leadership 
credentials and experience with global 
consumer-facing companies. 

Confidence in delivering 
on growth ambitions
I am confident in the strength of our 
business and brand portfolio and 
remain committed to our medium-term 
growth targets. During 2024, we expect 
to deliver organic revenue growth of 
4-6% and organic profit growth ahead 
of revenue growth. Together with our 
focus on continued strong cash 
generation and effective capital 
allocation, we expect to drive value and 
attractive returns for our shareholders.

Thank you
I’d like to thank all Haleon employees 
for their enormous contribution during 
a period of significant transformation. 
I’m incredibly proud to work with such 
a talented and dedicated global team. 
On behalf of the Executive Team, I’d also 
like to thank the Board for their ongoing 
support and guidance.

Our business environment

Industry overview and 
competitive landscape

The global consumer healthcare market is one of the largest, 
most resilient and fastest-growing segments across the consumer 
staples space, reaching £190bn1 in global value. 

The definition of consumer healthcare 
varies across competitors and industry 
data sources. We define it as consisting 
of Oral Health, VMS and OTC. The US is the 
largest market, representing over 25%1 of 
the total market, with emerging markets, 
notably China, India and Brazil, presenting 
attractive penetration opportunities. 

Brands differentiate through scientific 
claims, innovation, premiumisation and 
distinguished branding. The Oral Health 
market is relatively consolidated with the 
top five players making up nearly 65%1 
of the market. Haleon is the third largest 
competitor in this market with approximately 
11%1 market share, though is the number 
one player in Therapeutic Oral Health with 
c.50%1 market share in this sub-category. 
VMS, in contrast, is highly fragmented, with 
the largest player having approximately 
3%1 market share. Haleon is amongst the 
largest players though market definitions 
can significantly vary to include, amongst 
others, food and sports nutrition 
alongside multivitamins. 

The OTC category is distinct, defined 
primarily by its regulated status. OTC 
medicines are available in retail distribution 
channels (including pharmacies) without 
prescription. OTC comprises several 
categories defined by specific consumer 
needs, with competition at category level. 
These include, amongst others, Respiratory 
Health, Pain Relief, Digestive Health, Skin 
Health and Smokers’ Health. Respiratory 
Health is the category most impacted by 
seasonal demand which is heightened 
from October to January in North America 
and Europe from elevated flu incidences, 
which are typical during that period.

1  Source: Nicholas Hall (2023) and Haleon analysis of 

third-party data.

Broader industry dynamics
Historically, large consumer health 
businesses have existed as divisions 
within a larger pharmaceutical group. 
Haleon’s history reflects this, having 
been formed by the combination of 
three consumer health businesses over 
the last decade, and prior to its listing 
in 2022, being part of GSK. There is an 
increasing trend in the sector for parent 
pharmaceutical companies to consider 
improving shareholder value via a 
demerger of consumer health divisions. 
In 2023, the former consumer health 
division of Johnson & Johnson separated 
to form a new listed consumer health 
business, Kenvue. Additionally, Sanofi 
announced in 2023 its intention to 

separate its consumer health division via 
the creation of a publicly listed company. 
Other businesses in the sector include 
Bayer, Church & Dwight, Colgate-Palmolive, 
Nestle, Proctor & Gamble, Reckitt, and 
Unilever, along with local players. 

The overall consumer health industry is 
highly competitive. Haleon has been able 
to differentiate itself through its purpose, 
driving innovation, supported by 
investment in scientific and commercial 
capabilities, technology and digital.

Market 
drivers

The consumer health industry has attractive fundamentals. Understanding the 
environment and influences upon it informs our strategy, which allows us to be prepared 
for, and respond to, change in the market, and drive long-term stakeholder value.

Long-term market drivers of population growth and a growing middle class represent a strong growth driver for the consumer 
health industry. At the same time, ageing populations and the rising costs of healthcare are putting pressure on global health systems. 
Broad trends indicate a shift towards self-care with consumers taking a more active role in their health, supported by advances 
in digital technologies. All of these point towards favourable dynamics for the consumer healthcare market. Notably, the industry 
has been resilient despite challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with macroeconomic and inflationary pressures. 
However, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, including geopolitical conflict leading to inflation, commodity and 
input cost increases. Whilst some of the impacts are starting to dissipate, pressures on the consumer remain, including increased 
cost of living. We indicate how Haleon is responding to these drivers in our strategy and market categories sections from page 12.

2bn people
approximate 
increase in 
global population 
by 2050

Population growth and rising wealth in emerging markets continues to fuel economic 
growth. The global population is expected to increase by almost 2bn people by 
2050, with the growth fastest in developing countries. China and India are expected to 
account for approximately half of the economic growth, with a total population close 
to 3bn, and c.40% of global consumer spending expected within the next 20 years. 
This represents a long-term growth driver for the consumer healthcare market, with 
strong buying power driving increased per capita spend and usage in these economies. 

1.4bn

is important

The proportion of people aged 60 years and over is expected to increase from 1bn 
in 2020 to 1.4bn by 2030, and to almost double to 2.1bn by 2050. Population 
ageing – which started in high-income countries (e.g. Japan where 30% of the 
population is over 60 years old), is now moving towards low- and middle-income 
countries with two thirds of the global population who are 60 years and over 
expected to live in low- and middle-income countries by 2050. This brings with 
it an increased need for preventative care and self-care.

Consumers are increasingly taking ownership of their health, adopting more holistic 
and personalised approaches. McKinsey note a substantial increase in consumer 
prioritisation of wellness over the past two-to-three years. This continues to evolve 
along with our understanding of how the climate change impacts human health, 
which brings a broad spectrum of new and unanticipated healthcare needs and 
opportunities. The documented effects of climate degradation include infectious 
diseases, respiratory ailments, as well as mental health and neurological issues. 
This represents a sizeable growth opportunity for the healthcare industry. 

$7.33
saved by US 
healthcare system 
for every $1 spent 
on OTC medicine

OTC products in particular provide affordable and accessible healthcare options 
for consumers and lower the overall costs to health systems. Globally, public health 
systems are under pressure to meet increasing demand from patients against the 
backdrop of financial constraint. In the US, consumer spend on OTC medicines 
is estimated to save the US healthcare system $167bn from a combination of drug 
cost savings and unneeded doctor visits.

Targeted innovation across the consumer healthcare industry provides a means 
to address emerging trends as well as premiumisation (where consumers switch 
purchases to premium alternatives). In addition, emerging technologies can be 
harnessed to allow consumers to directly manage their own health. Technology is 
offering new options for education, coaching, engagement and patient support 
to improve health outcomes. These trends are driving an important evolution in 
preventative and self-care for consumers. In addition, advances in artificial 
intelligence (AI) and digitalisation provide opportunities to drive greater 
efficiencies in testing and innovation.

Pay down of debt
Since demerger, we have reduced net 
debt by over £2bn. We finished the 
year with leverage of 3.0x net debt/
adjusted EBITDA (vs c.4x at point of 
demerger in July 2022). We are now 
targeting to operate with leverage of 
around 2.5x net debt/adjusted EBITDA 
over the medium term. 

Shareholder returns
Haleon has a dividend policy that looks 
to balance all its stakeholders’ interests 
while ensuring the long-term success of 
the Company. The Board has proposed a 
final dividend of 4.2p, taking the total 
2023 dividend to 6.0p, representing 
approximately 35% of 2023 adjusted 
earnings. (2022: 30%). Including this 
dividend, Haleon will have returned 
£0.8bn to shareholders since demerger, 
and going forward, expects to grow its 
ordinary dividend at least in line with 
adjusted earnings. In addition, Haleon 
will allocate £500m to share buybacks 
during 2024.

Our strategy

Our strategy is designed to grow our portfolio of leading brands and 
market categories. We target sustainable above-market growth 
and attractive returns, with our purpose and culture bringing 
focus and clarity to the strategic decisions we make. 

The Board and Executive Team review updates on strategy throughout the year, including deep dive sessions on our strategic choices, 
to ensure continued focus on market drivers, relevance to our business model, and that capital is appropriately allocated. Using our 
competitive strengths of deep human understanding and trusted science, we are well placed to meet the growing demand for self-care 
and the opportunities to serve unmet consumer needs. Haleon does this by increasing condition awareness, building brand relevance 
and its innovation pipeline, and capitalising on new and emerging trends. We are mindful of the challenging consumer environment 
and pressures on people, and how this may impact self-care. The Company monitors and mitigates inflationary cost pressures with 
initiatives such as early forward buying, value engineering and supply chain improvements. We remain focused on balancing price 
and volume with net revenue management alongside cost and cash management.

Our strategy should be read in conjunction with the ensuing pages, where we give details of how our strategic pillars have been 
incorporated into our activities.

Underpinning the way we run our business are four strategic pillars:

1
Increase household 
penetration

2
Capitalise on new 
and emerging 
opportunities

3
Maintain strong 
execution and 
financial discipline

Maximise significant growth 
opportunities across our 
categories by applying 
our proven approach to 
penetration-led growth.

Increase growth of our 
brands across channels, 
routes to market and 
geographies. 

Focus on driving efficiency, 
effectiveness and 
agility to make every 
investment count.

Expand our portfolio through 
new and emerging consumer 
trends and by pursuing 
Rx-to-OTC switches.

4
Run a responsible
business

Make everyday health 
more inclusive.

Protect the environment 
and address social 
sustainability barriers

The importance of Oral Health
The World Health Organization 
recognises oral health diseases as 
highly prevalent with more than 3.5bn 
people affected3. Our aim is for our 
products to help eradicate preventable 
oral health problems. We are focused 
on therapeutic oral health – sensitivity 
and gum disease are widespread 
therapeutic oral health conditions, 
with around 45-50% of consumers 
experiencing these conditions4. 
Treatment rates are low with only a third 
of users using a specialist toothpaste4. 

Our position
We have a clearly defined position 
and strategy as a premium, specialist, 
therapeutic oral health player with 
a number one position in sensitivity 
with Sensodyne, and a number two 
position in gum health with parodontax. 
Moreover, we have a strong leadership 
position in denture care. While we have 
a broad geographic presence, emerging 
markets comprise around a third of our 
revenue vs nearly 50% for category, and 
this provides an opportunity for us. 

A key focus area remains driving 
increased household penetration of 
our brands. We continue to innovate 
to meet therapeutic needs with the 
consumer having four oral health 
conditions on average.

clinical studies on Centrum Silver, with 
positive results on cognitive function, 
which provided a new claim for the 
product. This was activated across a 
number of markets leading to share 
gains in the US and China, as well as 
across Europe and Latin America. 
 — Having launched Centrum in India 
through the e-commerce channel 
in 2022, with a campaign to build 
awareness around multivitamin 
deficiency, we further expanded the 
portfolio to include Benefit Blends.

campaigns using both traditional 
and non-traditional channels. We also 
expanded the Centrum global footprint 
with new market entries into Sweden, 
Libya and Iraq.

Strategic Report

The importance of VMS
Globally, one third2 of the population 
have a micronutrient deficiency, which 
increases the risk of developing chronic 
disease. In addition, a number of trends 
including inequality in healthcare, 
sedentary lifestyles, poor nutrition and 
climate-change factors, are contributing 
to the growth of this category. Consumers 
are looking to be more proactive in their 
wellness regime and are using a variety 
of approaches to look after their health 
and overall wellness. Using VMS is 
seen as a way to gain control and have 
confidence that they are doing what 
they can to stay healthy and well. 

Our position
The VMS category is highly fragmented 
with the top 20 players accounting for 
around 23%1 of the market. Haleon has 
the leading position, with c.3%1 share. 
The vast majority of our revenues are 
derived from three brands: Centrum – 
the world’s leading multivitamin; 
Caltrate – a leader in calcium/bone 
health in China; and Emergen-C – 
a leader in immunity in the US. 
This portfolio is complemented by 
smaller Local Growth brands, which 
are leaders in their respective 
markets/sub-categories.

The importance of Pain Relief
Pain is a universal condition with 
the vast majority of the population 
experiencing pain and, on average, 
people experience two pain conditions 
per year. With ageing populations, 
sedentary lifestyles and the impact of 
climate change on consumer health, 
pain incidence and frequency 
continues to rise. 

Our position
At a global level, the top five players 
account for c.35%1 of the category,

Our 2023 achievements
 — Panadol achieved strong growth in 
EMEA & LatAm as a result of the 
success of the new ‘Release Starts 
Here’ campaign. This campaign 
addressed specialist need states such 
as migraine, body pain and headache. 
 — We launched natural variants across a 

number of markets to expand our reach. 
Our variants are designed to engage 
with a younger consumer base. Recent 
launches included Panadol PanaNatra, 
which we launched in Australia. 
 — We further extended the range of 

Advil Dual Action to back pain, the third 
most common pain indication, and an 
underserved consumer need with only 
20%2 of consumers currently ‘very 
satisfied’ with current back pain 
treatments. The product has 
received positive early feedback 
with convenience, value and back 
pain efficacy highlighted by users.
 — In China, Haleon was able to meet 
increased consumer demand for 
Fenbid following the lifting of 
COVID-19 related restrictions, 
despite tight labour conditions arising 
from COVID-19. We doubled our 
manufacturing output at our Tianjin 
facility to ensure adequate supplies of 
these products to Chinese consumers 
and hospitals. Strong collaboration 

with our suppliers ensured raw 
material supply to our facility.

 — Initiated in 2022 and concluded in 

2023, Haleon worked closely with the 
Canadian government following the 
surge in respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV) and incidences of cold and flu 
cases in children with Children’s Advil. 

 — Voltaren launched liquid capsules in 
Italy and expanded its penetration of 
24-hour patches globally. In addition, 
the brand launched ‘Movement Coach’ 
in the UK, a digital health tool for 
people in pain, and ‘HaltungsCheck,’ 
an AI-powered posture check tool built 
in conjunction with physiotherapists, 
in Germany. 

What’s next
 — We are fuelling the growth of Panadol 

by increasing our household penetration 
and accessibility, and expanding 
systemic presence in other markets. 

 — We are also rebuilding relevance 

for Voltaren Topical and increasing 
penetration of Advil by upweighting 
investment, innovation, and 
brand relevance.

 — The Theraflu ‘Rest & Recover’ campaign 
in the US and Poland raised awareness 
of the barriers to sick leave for working 
mothers. In the US, Theraflu advocated 
for a policy change to have access to 
paid sick leave.

What’s next
 — We are looking to maintain growth 
of the portfolio and selectively 
expand into key sub-categories. 
 — Drive growth and penetration by 
launching Otrivin Nasal Mist in 
additional markets.

Our 2023 achievements
 — Launched Otrivin Nasal Mist in three 
European markets – Poland, Portugal 
and Greece. This is a new technology 
exclusive to Haleon that delivers a 
more comfortable experience, with 
the release of a wide, gentle mist, 
and an easier side-actuation 
method which aids consumers with 
hand dexterity challenges. 
 — Supported the innovation and 
strong in-market commercial 
execution of Theraflu. Theraflu Max+ 
saw particularly strong growth and now 
accounts for c.25% of Theraflu sales in 
the US. We also continued to see strong 
uplift from natural products launched 
in previous years, such as Theraflu 
ProNatural and have expanded the 
range into the UAE. 

 — In allergy, we enhanced our offering 

with Flonase Nighttime Allergy Relief. 

 — We expanded our Robitussin range 
with Robitussin Medi-Soothers, a 
dual-action liquid-filled lozenge that 
soothes sore throats and treats coughs. 
 — Continued development and expansion 
of Otrivin’s ‘Actions to Breathe Cleaner’ 
programme to educate children on air 
pollution and actions they can take to 
mitigate the impact on their health.

The importance of Digestive 
Health and Other
Digestive health issues are prevalent, 
with 60-80%2 of the population 
affected, and sufferers having around 
five episodes per month on average. 
Symptoms include acid reflux/
heartburn, bloating, flatulence, 
indigestion, constipation and diarrhoea. 
Sufferers frequently experience more 
than one symptom at a time. 

Our position
Haleon has the leading position in 
Digestive Health driven by strong 
positions in immediate-relief antacids. 
We have a focused geographic presence 
in Digestive Health across US, India and 
Brazil, underpinned by our Local Growth 
brands. This category also includes our 
smoking-cessation brands such as 
Nicorette, which has been helping 
consumers quit smoking for over 40 years. 
In addition, we have a number of Skin 
Health brands including Bactroban, the 
leading wound-healing brand in China, 
and Zovirax and Abreva, the world’s two 
leading cold sore treatments. During the 
year, we reached agreements to divest 
both ChapStick and Lamisil, which will 
allow Haleon to reduce complexity in 
the business and focus more resources 
on higher growth brands.

1  Non-completion due to leavers during the period.

Our culture is supported by our 
governance and organisational structure. 
The Board is responsible for, and monitors, 
our culture, including adherence to our 
core value and behaviours to ensure they 
are embedded and aligned to our strategy 
and purpose. The Directors receive regular 
reports on all aspects of culture, including 
reports from our Speak Up channel and 
results from our employee survey. The CEO 
and Executive Team are responsible for 
embedding our culture on a day-to-day 
basis, as well as for implementing our 
strategy, monitoring the Group’s 
performance, and providing updates to 
the Board on overall performance, risk 
management and our system of internal 
controls. We have 14 business units, 
alongside global category and brand 
teams, who are responsible for delivering 
our strategy, innovation agenda and global 
brand campaigns. They are supported by 
global functions, in key areas including 
ethics and compliance, corporate affairs, 
sustainability, finance, human resources, 
legal, marketing and R&D. 

During 2023, we embarked on a three-year 
productivity programme to transition to 
an organisation focused on efficiency 
and agility ensuring we deliver our 
purpose and strategy. This has resulted 
in structural changes and severances, 
which we have aimed to handle sensitively 
and in compliance with all applicable laws 
and regulations. Inevitably, this has had 
a short-term impact on our culture as we 
embed our new structure and ways of 
working. Additional details are in Note 6 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

>>  Further details about our governance 

structure and Board activities, including 
consideration of culture are in the Corporate 
Governance section from page 61.

Measuring our culture
Measuring and tracking our culture 
is crucial to ensuring we deliver our 
purpose and strategy, and remain a 
trusted company. We have a range of 
indicators including consumer, customer 
and supplier feedback forums mentioned 
in our stakeholder section, and not limited 
to the examples below: 

 — Annual mandatory Code of Conduct 
training including anti-bribery and 
corruption and keeping data secure 
for all the Board, Executive Team, 
employees and third-party temporary 
workers, with a 98%1 completion rate 
in 2023. It is also part of onboarding 
requirements for new starters.
 — A framework of internal financial 

and operational controls, audit and 
assurance programmes that monitor the 
Company’s compliance with regulations 
and internal procedures and policies. 
Reports are sent to senior management, 
the Executive Team and the Audit & Risk 
Committee for monitoring, review and 
discussion. Where required, corrective 
measures are put in place to reinforce 
appropriate procedures. During 2023, 
no unsatisfactory rated internal audit 
reports were issued. 

 — Haleon encourages anyone, whether 
working for the Company or not, to 
speak up about misconduct, breaches of 
policy or procedures, and suspected 
violations of laws and regulations. 
Concerns are managed independently 
and can be raised in 35 languages via 
web form, email, telephone, or post. 
All cases are handled in accordance 
with Haleon’s investigatory principles: 
humanity, confidentiality, proportionality 
and non-retaliation. Regular updates 
and investigation reports are reviewed 
by senior management and the Audit 
& Risk Committee, and learnings are 
converted into recommendations 
and updated training.

Strategic Report

 — Our annual employee survey measures 
both employee engagement and our 
wider culture. Our 2023 results showed 
78% of employees felt that Haleon 
fulfils its core engagement values, and 
78% feel that it fulfils its core cultural 
objectives. Areas where we do well 
include our customer focus, commitment 
to the environment, society and 
business ethics, whereas we need 
to continue to focus on our work 
processes and how we collaborate. 
 — We measure our environmental, health 
and safety performance across the 

Company and conduct risk-based 
audits that the Executive Team and 
Board monitor. Metrics include, but are 
not limited to, our reportable injury and 
illness rate, which in 2023 was 0.14 per 
100,000 hours worked*1, and there 
were no fatalities*2. 

 — We conduct regular conversations 

and year-end reviews with employees, 
which include them demonstrating 
their actions and contributions during 
the year against our core value and 
behaviours, and where applicable, 
leadership standards.

Our people

Our people comprise of permanent 
and fixed-term direct employees. 
Our business is also supported 
by third-party temporary workers 
and contractors. 

We aspire to have people policies that 
provide equal opportunities, create 
an inclusive culture and support our 
purpose, strategy and long-term success. 
Our initiatives and policies reflect 
relevant employment law, including the 
provisions of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and International 
Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 

Attracting, fostering and 
developing talent
During 2023, we worked to strengthen 
our recruitment approach so that we 
consistently attract leading talent, 
maintain a diverse employee-base and 
provide opportunities for career and 
skills development to retain our existing 
talent. New hires were made in roles 
and locations strategically important 
to business success, and we made 
incremental improvements in key 
performance areas. However, there remain 
significant opportunities to optimise our 
hiring processes and experiences for 
candidates and stakeholders. We are 
focused on this as part of our three-year 
productivity programme. 

Development and learning at Haleon 
has three objectives: build the right 
competencies to stay safe and compliant 
within our regulatory environment; 
develop strategic capabilities; and 
provide employees with opportunities to 
grow and reach their potential. In 2023, 
we introduced a simplified global learning 
offering to all employees through our 
internal development portal and external 

content libraries with a range of 
development courses, videos and articles, 
and supported by a mini-MBA in deep 
human understanding. 

 — Developing a respectful workplace 

training module, focused on preventing 
harassment and retaliation.

To embed our leadership standards, 
build capabilities and develop leadership 
behaviours, we established a global 
leadership development programme. 
In addition, a suite of self-serve, leader-led 
sessions were launched to support all 
new teams as the business continues to 
transform, which will be expanded in 2024. 
We also launched a simplified approach 
to talent management based on our 
Leadership Standards, including holding 
talent reviews throughout the year to 
understand our talent landscape and the 
strategic capabilities needed to drive 
business growth. Furthermore, we evolved 
and simplified our approach to assessing 
and rewarding employee performance. 
Through regular conversations, employee 
performance is reviewed against 
objectives, and performance outcomes 
are calibrated across the business. 

Employee health and wellbeing
Supporting our employees’ health and 
wellbeing, building a culture that allows 
them to be at their best and thrive is a 
priority for us. Building on the initiatives 
we already offer and as outlined in our 
2022 Annual Report, in 2023 we focused 
on the following: 

 — MyWellbeing, a holistic energy-

management and resilience course that 
equips participants with skills and tools 
to optimise their own wellbeing. 
 — Micro-learnings, themed webinars 

and resources to increase capability 
for oneself and others.

Looking ahead, we plan to review 
and refresh our preventative health 
programme, which gives employees and 
their eligible dependants access to a core 
set of healthcare services. We also expect 
to launch a new occupational health and 
wellbeing standard to improve governance 
and oversight of our initiatives, and refresh 
and relaunch our existing Mental Health 
Matters training for line managers. 

Workplace environment 
During 2023, we opened new offices in 
both London, UK, and Bengaluru, India, 
with sensory rooms and green and open 
spaces in which to connect, create and 
collaborate. Our Bengaluru office was 
awarded a ‘Gold’ accessibility score 
by Mobility Mojo for offering a safe 
environment for employees with 
disabilities and neurodivergence. 

Where possible, employees are able 
to embrace our ‘Hybrid at Haleon’ 
philosophy, which empowers managers 
and teams to trust each other and find 
the right approach to drive performance. 
For those working remotely, we have 
enhanced controls and systems to ensure 
our Company data is secure, including 
awareness campaigns as part of our 
wider commitment to the responsible 
use, storage and protection of Company 
and personal data. Important data 
is safeguarded from corruption, 
compromise or loss and we have 
appropriate data retention schedules 
to guide us as to when to delete data.

Championing diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DEI)
We are committed to creating a diverse, 
inclusive and respectful workplace, and 
view this as key to delivering our purpose 
and strategy. We acknowledge that this 
is an area for continual improvement, 
including further strengthening our 
diversity data and ensuring it is integrated 
into our culture. Our position statement 
applies to all employees and third-party 
temporary workers. Our ambition is focused 
on delivering three strategic priorities: 

1   Employee belonging: workplace 

inclusion – create a work environment 
that is inclusive and accessible where 
all employees feel like they belong, 
are valued and have tools to thrive. 

2   Diverse representation: workforce 
diversity – attract, recruit, promote 
and retain the best talent that reflects 
a diverse workforce at all levels and 
areas of the business. 

3   Societal change: community impact 
– leverage our expertise to enable 
health inclusivity through our business 
relationships, brands and research.

Our global DEI council is sponsored by 
the Chief Human Resources Officer and 
chaired by the Global Head of Talent. 
The council meets quarterly to discuss 
priorities, drive accountability, and initiate, 
fund and oversee the implementation of 
Haleon’s global DEI activities. 

We have made progress against our DEI 
goals in 2023 with several initiatives that 
incorporate key areas of diversity, including 
ethnicity, disability, LGBTQ+ and gender. 

 — Our diversity dashboard provides 

insights around gender, allowing us 
to track progress, and proactively 
communicate findings and 
recommendations back to the business. 

 — We are piloting an athlete career 

transition (ACT) programme to support 
attracting and hiring diverse talent. 

 — Our people-management development 
programme develops DEI capabilities, 
including how we address unconscious 
bias. We launched our diverse talent 
programme, designed to accelerate 
leadership potential and career 
progression, and have five cohorts 
set up for 2024. 

In addition, our four global ERGs 
successfully delivered 10 flagship events 
in 2023, with c.2,000 participants and 
150 local events. Our ERGs help build 
our inclusive culture and are instrumental 
in providing different perspectives. 

>>  See also our Nominations & Governance 

Committee Report on page 78.

Upholding our standards
We are committed to transparency, 
integrity, consumer satisfaction, safety 
and compliance with all relevant laws 
and regulations. We have standards and 
policies in place to ensure we uphold 
the highest business ethics, including 
consumer and pharmacovigilance policies 
and processes. Our products undergo 
extensive quality testing and controls 
as part of our manufacturing processes. 
In addition, we have portals for 
consumers to get product information 
and report adverse reactions. 

Code of Conduct
Our Code promotes ethical business 
conduct, and provides guidance to our 
Board and Executive Team, employees 
and third-party temporary workers. 
Failing to comply with our Code is 
deemed to be misconduct and can 
result in disciplinary action, including 
dismissal. Our suppliers, distributors, 
agents, consultants and contractors are 
also subject to many of its principles. 

 — 19 principles. 
 — Available in 17 languages.

 — Mixture of written standards and a 

decision tree approach to making the 
right choices and guidance on when 
to ask for advice.

Anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC)
Our ABAC Policy sets out our global 
principles, standards, requirements and 
zero-tolerance approach. All employees 
and third-party temporary workers must 
observe and uphold the policy. 

 — Regular checks are run internally as 

part of our financial control procedures, 
and due diligence checks are performed 
on all high-risk suppliers. 

 — During 2023, an update on the state 
of implementation of the policy was 
reported to the Executive Team and 
Audit & Risk Committee. 

Human rights
Our Human Rights Policy sets out how we 
integrate human rights into our business 
operations and our relationships with 
suppliers. We seek to align our human 
rights procedures with international 
agreements and guidelines, such as the 
UN Guiding Principles on Business and 

Human Rights (UNGPs) and the 
Organisation for Economic Co-Operation 
and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises. We are 
committed to upholding the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the core 
labour standards set out by the ILO. 

 — Our Human Rights Steering Committee 

comprised of members of our Executive 
Team and senior management, provide 
oversight and support on key issues. 
It is responsible for approving and 
monitoring our human rights strategy 
and action plan, which is reported to 
the Environmental & Social 
Sustainability Committee annually. 

 — We have key actions across three 

workstreams: building our capacity 
to understand human rights risks; 
strengthening due diligence processes; 
and investing in business relationships 
to prevent and mitigate risks and 
remediate impacts. 

 — During 2023, we initiated a saliency 
assessment of human rights risks in 
Haleon’s value chain to enable us to focus 
on issues important to our business.

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Strategic Report

Strategic Report

 — We developed an e-learning module, 
translated into 15 languages, which 
we launched in 2023 and will roll-out 
further in 2024. A facilitators’ pack 
was also developed for use at 
manufacturing sites where workers 
have no access to computers. 

 — We developed an incident response 
and communications plan, and ran 
workshops for employees across key 
business functions.

Responsible suppliers
Haleon’s supply chain has significant scale 
and complexity with a mixture of direct 
and indirect supplies and services such 
as raw materials and logistics. We are a 
member of Manufacture 2030, a platform 
to drive consistency and transparency of 
supplier sustainability reporting. 

 — Our Supplier Code of Conduct 

establishes the minimum environmental, 
social and ethical standards to be met 
by any entity that supplies products or 
services to Haleon. 

 — We follow set processes for contracting 

with new suppliers, and those we 
continue to work with, including due 
diligence processes and using 
approved buying channels. 

 — In 2023, we launched our Supplier ESG 
Expectations outlining targets that we 
want our suppliers to meet, such as 
moving to renewable electricity and 
ensuring certain materials are covered 
by industry-recognised certifications. 

 — Our third-party risk management 

process seeks to assess risks across 
our supply chain, and where necessary 
we undertake targeted in-depth due 
diligence. We use a combination of 
EcoVadis and Sedex assessments and 
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative 
audits to assess risks to drive 
improvements. 

Health and safety
We continue to embed our Environment, 
Health, Safety and Wellbeing Policy and 
three-year strategy to develop a zero-harm 
culture and reduce significant incidents. 
We have an environment, health and safety 
(EHS) management system and are focused 
on three pillars: to strengthen our health 
and safety culture and capability; prevent 
harm; and make it easier. Each pillar is 
supported by annual targets and 
objectives to drive continuous improvement, 
which has helped reduce the number of 
reportable and serious incidents. 

 — We run risk-based health and safety 

training for employees and third-party 
temporary workers, which includes 
how to identify measures to reduce 
workplace risks. 

 — All contractors working at Haleon 

sites receive induction training and 
instruction on working safely.

 — During 2023, we focused on refreshing 
and integrating our global EHS and 
engineering standards, reinforcing our 
12 Life Saving Rules and deploying 
our Leading with Care programme to 
senior leaders across the Company. 

 — Looking ahead, we are focused on 

risk assessment training, and further 
embedding our Leading with Care 
programme and suite of EHS and 
engineering standards. 

>>  See also our statement of compliance on 
page 60 with links to our standards and 
policies, including our Code of Conduct 
and Modern Slavery Statement.

Cyber-security
As detailed in our approach to risk and 
risk factors, there is a risk that a cyber-
security attack could compromise our 
ability to manufacture, distribute and 
sell our products and services to our 
customers. Our commitment to cyber-
security is reflected in our ongoing 
investment into this area, which includes 
the use of advanced technologies and 
engagement of third-party experts to 
provide additional support and 
guidance. We have a dedicated cyber-
security threat intelligence function 
focused on the threat landscape and 
attack vectors that are targeting 
healthcare providers, including 
ransomware threats. Cyber intelligence is 
integrated into our cyber-security risk 
management and governance processes. 
Haleon’s Chief Information Security 
Officer is responsible for the cyber-
security function, and provides frequent 
updates including current threats, 
operational key risk indicators, and 
cyber-security maturity improvements 
to the Executive Team and Audit & Risk 
Committee, who have oversight of our 
information security and cyber risk 
strategy. Cyber-security risk updates 
are shared with the wider Board by 
the Committee. 

 — Our Chief Information Security Officer 

has over 25 years of information 
technology and security experience.
 — External consultants are engaged to 
assess our cyber-security maturity 
against the US National Institute 
of Standards and Technology 
Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). 
They help guide our plans and 
processes to best protect Haleon 
from threats including a framework 
for data controls which covers our 
digital supply chain. 

 — We have a third-party risk management 
process in place ensuring that inherent 
risk assessments are completed for 
third-party suppliers with additional 
due diligence assessments completed 
for higher-risk suppliers. Processes 
include identification and mitigation 
of risks, risk assessments, adherence 
to information and control standards, 
and incident notification requirements 
in contracts. 

 — We constantly look to mature our 

cyber-security systems and controls to 
keep pace with the threat landscape. 
Our preparedness activities include 
testing our response procedures and 
processes by performing simulations 
and crisis management exercises, and 
penetration testing to develop our 

response to potential incidents, such 
as ransomware attacks. Vulnerability 
management, monitoring and alerting 
processes are in place to help protect 
the Company against cyber attacks. 

 — Our annual awareness campaigns 
promote our global cyber-security 
policies and procedures, handling of 
confidential data, social media and 
cyber-security practices, and remind 
employees of resources available 
to protect themselves, Haleon and 
consumers. Internal policies for 
protecting Company assets include 
protection of information, acceptable 
use of technology resources, AI and 
related procedures. We are focused 
on minimising risks through fostering 
secure practices and behaviours, 
for example, constant programmes 
aimed at recognising and reporting 
suspicious online behaviour 
or phishing. 

 — During 2023, Haleon did not identify 
any significant cyber-security incidents.

Our approach to 
sustainability

As a global leader in consumer healthcare, we believe Haleon is well placed to 
understand and help address several of the social and environmental barriers 
holding people back from achieving better everyday health.

During 2023 we focused on:
 — The launch of ‘The Advil Pain Equity 
Project’ with a long-term aim to help 
address the bias and prejudice that 
Black people in America experience 
when they seek pain management. 

 — In Thailand and the Philippines, 

Polident’s ‘Smiles Can’t Wait’ provided 
free dentures to over 1,500 people who 
otherwise were not able to afford them, 
and also provided accessible oral health 
check-ups, samples, and educational 
kits to over 50,000 people. 

 — We expanded the reach of, and content 
available on, the Haleon Health Partner 
portal, an online database which 
includes tools and materials to 
support Health Professionals when 
they have conversations with patients. 

 — We continued to support Economist 
Impact in their publication of the 
second phase of the Health Inclusivity 
Index (Index). Phase two of the Index 
included the measurement of experience 
of health inclusion across 42,000 
people in 40 countries. The Index 
found that more than three in five 
people worldwide experience health 
exclusion, with vulnerable and younger 
populations the worst affected. 

 — Following earthquakes in Turkey and 

Syria, Haleon worked with Direct Relief 
to sponsor dental clinics in the affected 
areas, which provided treatment for 
more than 10,000 people.

Our responsible business strategy is 
committed to making everyday health 
more inclusive, reducing our environmental 
impact, and operating with ethical and 
responsible standards of business 
conduct. In 2023, we established the 
Environmental & Social Sustainability 
Committee (ESS), reflecting the strategic 
importance of this area. 

Progress against our responsible business 
strategy was externally recognised in 2023, 
our first year of rating by several ESG 
indices. Haleon received a low-risk rating 
by Sustainalytics and was recognised as 
one of their 2024 ESG Top-Rated Companies. 
We were also added to the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index Europe (DJSI) 2023, 
and S&P’s 2024 Global Sustainability 
Yearbook, based on our score in the top 
decile of the Personal Products Category.

Health inclusivity
In 2023, we empowered over 41 million 
people to be more included in opportunities 
for better everyday health1, through 
inclusive products, education programmes 
and services. We aim to empower 50 
million people a year by 2025. We track 
the number of people engaging with a 
Haleon brand or expert initiative to 
improve their self-care. Our focus includes 
those who are discriminated against 
because of disability, age, race and 
ethnicity, gender and sexuality. We take 
action to improve health inclusivity by 
driving change through our brands, 
empowering self-care, investing in 
research and action, and building 
healthier communities through our 
community investment programmes.

Environment
Haleon is focused on continually reducing 
the environmental impact of its products 
and operations. We are using leading 
industry standards and working with 
industry groups, peers and suppliers 
to achieve our environmental aims. 

We have set greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions reduction goals aligned to 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) pathway to 1.5°C and aim 
to achieve net zero carbon emissions 
from source to sale by 2040, aligned to 
guidance from The Climate Pledge and 
Race to Zero. Haleon also works to raise 
awareness of the linkages between 
climate change, air pollution and health, 
and has joined the Alliance for Clean Air. 

We continue to improve the data 
collection processes used to measure 
and track our Scope 3 emissions and 
virgin petroleum-based plastic 
footprint. We have updated our 
baseline year from 2020 to 2022, 
when we became a standalone 
business, as the 2022 data used 
to calculate and substantiate our 
packaging footprint and value chain 
emissions has greater availability 
and accuracy. Our virgin plastic 
reduction goal is calibrated 
considering limitations in the use of 
mechanically recycled plastic for 
healthcare products. We are working 
with suppliers to access bioplastics 
and chemically recycled resins 
suitable for healthcare products, 
whilst introducing mechanically 
recycled plastics in some product 
formats where permitted.

(2022: 22m+)

Reduce our net Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 100% by 2030 vs a 2020 baseline2.

Reduce our Scope 3 carbon emissions from source to sale by 42% by 2030 vs 
a 2022 baseline. 

Reduce our use of virgin petroleum-based plastic by 10% by 2025, and a third 
by 2030 vs a 2022 baseline3. 

Develop solutions for all product packaging to be recycle-ready by 2025, as part 
of our goal to make all packaging recyclable or reusable by 2030, where safety, 
quality and regulations permit. 

All key agricultural, forest and marine-derived materials used in our ingredients 
and packaging to be sustainably sourced and deforestation-free by 20304. 

In 2023, our Scope 3 emissions and virgin 
petroleum-based plastic footprints have 
increased in the reporting period due to 
a mixture of volume growth, inventory 
holding, and the mix of products sold. 
We remain confident in our future 
delivery based on our pipeline of 
reduction projects that will contribute 
towards achievement of these aims.

We achieved our goal of producing one 
billion recycle-ready toothpaste tubes 
since their initial launch in 2020, two 
years ahead of our aim to achieve this 
by 2025. We are also driving global 
and local initiatives to collect, sort and 
recycle our packaging. In 2023, Haleon 

worked with Colgate-Palmolive, New 
Jersey-based Mazza Recycling and San 
Francisco-based AI company Glacier to 
improve the sorting of toothpaste tubes 
within waste at recycling centres in 
New Jersey, US. This is part of our larger 
industry combined efforts to increase 
recycling of toothpaste tubes.

As part of our aim to source key 
ingredients and packaging materials 
more sustainably, we increased the 
number of materials in scope for 
sustainable sourcing reporting in 2023, 
with a focus on also increasing our 
percentage of sustainably sourced 
paper materials.

As members of the Alliance for Water 
Stewardship (AWS), we are taking 
steps to enable more environmentally 
sustainable and socially equitable 
management of water. This includes 
certifying our manufacturing sites with 
the AWS certification by 2025 and aiming 
for water neutrality for sites in water-
stressed basins by 2030. We achieved 
our first water neutral site and our first 
site recommended for AWS certification 
in 2023, at Cape Town, South Africa.

1  The 2023 reporting period for Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions (market-based) and health inclusivity is 1 December 2022 - 30 November 2023. The 2023 reporting period for Scope 3 
emissions, packaging and sustainable sourcing is 1 July 2022 – 30 June 2023. The 2020 and 2022 baseline reporting periods are the calendar years. The 2022 reporting period for 
Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions (market-based) and health inclusivity is the calendar year, and for packaging and sustainable sourcing is 1 July 2021 – 30 June 2022. Scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions calculated in line with the GHG Protocol. Scope 1 and 2 are emissions from Haleon’s direct operations. Scope 3 includes all indirect emissions from Haleon’s value chain, 
and our source to sale commitments include GHG Protocol categories except 6, 7 and 10-15.

disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F. Our updated total scope 1 & 2 emissions (market-based) 2020 baseline is 96 thousand tonnes CO2e, from the 89 thousand 
tonnes CO2e reported in 2022*.

3  Scope includes product packaging and some devices, including toothbrushes. The calculation is based on our internal manufacturing data and does not include data on 

third-party manufacturing.

4  Scope includes Haleon’s globally managed spend on key materials which are agricultural, forestry or marine-derived. Globally managed spend covers the majority of our 

internal spend and expands across some of our third-party manufacturing network.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

Our purpose underpins our drive to tackle carbon emissions. We aim to 
achieve net zero carbon emissions from source to sale by 2040 aligned 
to guidance from The Climate Pledge and Race to Zero. 

In accordance with TCFD guidance, we 
have conducted a comprehensive analysis 
to assess the risks and opportunities 
linked to climate change that may have an 
impact on our business. This statement 
highlights the most significant risks 
identified, along with any financial 
implications, and outlines the 
corresponding actions we are undertaking 
in response. 

Compliance statement
In accordance with the FCA’s Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(8), Companies Act 2006, S414CB(A1) 
and (2A), and the SEC’s Guidance Regarding 
Disclosure Related to Climate Change 
(2010), we present our TCFD compliance 
statement and confirm that we have 
made climate-related financial disclosure 
for the year ended 31 December 2023 
which is consistent with the TCFD 
Recommendations and Recommended 
Disclosures, on pages 24 – 31.

Governance

Governance over climate-related risks and opportunities is consistent with the governance 
structures in place across Haleon, comprising of the Board, Board subcommittees, 
executive and management-level governance committees, and specialist working groups 
(see diagram below, with arrows indicating flow of information).

>>  We also include further climate-related 

disclosures throughout the Annual Report, 
including information on our principal risk 
related to ESG on page 56, key performance 
indicators on pages 32-33, Notes 1 and 12 
of the Financial Statements on page 123 
and from page 133, and a breakdown of 
our GHG emissions on page 189. 

The Board takes overall accountability 
for risk and opportunity management, 
including climate change. The Board 
delegates specific matters related to 
climate change to subcommittees in 
the following ways: 

 — The Environmental & Social 

Sustainability Committee (ESS) reviews 
progress against Haleon’s environmental 
and social governance (ESG) metrics 
and reviews delivery against its key 
environmental and net zero priorities. 
The Committee meets at least twice 
a year and is composed of three 
Non-Executive Directors. In their first 
meeting, the Committee received an 
‘Education and Assessment’ session, 
facilitated by external experts, to 
evaluate Haleon’s responsible 
business strategy and goals, 
including those on climate. 

 — The Audit & Risk Committee meets at 
least four times a year and oversees 
Haleon’s principal risks, including 
Haleon’s principal risk related to ESG, 
which covers climate change (page 56). 
 — The Remuneration Committee meets at 
least four times a year and supports 
Haleon’s climate strategy by aligning 
Haleon’s Performance Share Plan with 
ESG performance via the ESG qualifier. 
This includes our Scope 1 and 2 
decarbonisation commitment (page 83).

Strategic Report

Strategic Report

Responsible business scorecards, 
at both enterprise-wide and business 
unit level, track in-year targets against 
our responsible business commitments, 
including targets tracking carbon 
emissions reduction. The ESS Committee 
and the Executive Team receive progress 
updates against these quarterly, 
including performance against our 
climate commitments, alongside 
other information as a tool to inform 
decision-making.

Responsible business targets are tied 
to employee personal objectives and 
performance evaluations where relevant, 
including climate-related objectives for 
executive management. Executive 
remuneration incorporates specific 
responsible business-related KPIs. For the 
year ended 2023, this included climate-
related objectives (see pages 33 and 88).

We also use scenario analysis and 
stakeholder input to identify, assess and 
manage climate-related opportunities, and 
consider these in our strategy accordingly.

The most significant climate-related risks 
and opportunities are described in detail 
on pages 27 to 31 along with our plans 
to manage these, with an impact summary 
on page 123. These are considered to have 
the most significant impact on our 
business, strategy and financial planning. 
Risk and mitigation plans undergo a formal 
review at least once a year. Haleon will 
conduct a climate-related risk and 
opportunity assessment using scenario 
analysis at least every three years.

The Chief Executive Officer and the 
Executive Team are responsible for the 
delivery of Haleon’s responsible business 
strategy, and they are supported by 
various governance forums to monitor 
the climate strategy, including the 
management of climate-related risks 
and opportunities. 

 — The Environment Steering Committee 
governs progress against Haleon’s 
environment strategy and commitments, 
including climate change commitments. 
The Committee meets at least quarterly 
and makes strategic recommendations 
on managing our environmental 
footprint for approval by the Executive 
Team and the Board. It also monitors 
climate-related risks and opportunities. 
It is chaired by the Vice President of 
Sustainability and Executive Team 
members include the Chief Corporate 
Affairs Officer, the Chief Supply Chain 
Officer, and the Chief R&D Officer. 
 — The Enterprise Risk and Compliance 

Committee (ERCC) consists of members 
of the Executive Team and Heads of 
Audit and Risk, and of Ethics and 
Compliance. The ERCC meets quarterly 
and ensures that principal risks are 
managed effectively, reviewing them 
twice a year. This includes Haleon’s 

principal risk related to ESG, which 
covers climate-related risks (see page 
56). The principal risk is owned by 
the Chief Corporate Affairs Officer 
and monitored through Haleon’s risk 
management framework, described 
from page 53. 

 — Compliance and Risk Forums (CRF) are 
conducted by our functional teams, 
categories and business units, to 
embed risk management in day-to-day 
business operations. The Sustainability 
CRF meets at least bi-monthly and is 
responsible for monitoring, assessing, 
and mitigating potential risks that may 
impact Haleon’s responsible business 
strategy delivery, including risks 
associated with climate change. 
Membership includes the Vice President 
of Sustainability and members of the 
sustainability team. 

 — Working groups in our global functions, 
global categories and business units 
integrate responsible business targets, 
principles and initiatives (including 
climate change) into Haleon’s strategic 
business planning process, capital 
planning and budgeting, evaluation of 
potential divestments or acquisitions, 
day-to-day responsibilities and 
metric management.

Strategy and risk management 
Identifying, assessing, and 
managing climate-related risks
The process for identifying, assessing 
and managing climate-related risks is 
consistent with Haleon’s four-step 
enterprise risk management process 
described from page 53. This ensures 
that accountability for the identification, 
assessment, mitigation and monitoring of 
risks is aligned with Haleon’s strategic 
objectives. At the corporate level, ESG 
and the integration of sustainability and 
climate-related risks into our Business 
and investment decisions was identified 
as a principal risk 56, reflecting the level of 
enterprise prioritisation.

The Sustainability CRF leads the climate 
risk identification and assessment 
process, which is formally conducted on 
an annual basis. Risks are assessed by 
taking into consideration the likely impact 
(considering both financial and reputation 
impacts), the probability of the risk, and 

the controls that are in place to manage 
the risk, in line with Haleon’s risk 
management framework outlined from 
page 53. This helps to identify where 
management should focus its effort. 

Continuous evaluation and management 
of risk is embedded in our strategy to 
ensure an appropriate, measured and 
timely response. Risk owners are assigned 
to climate risks and continually monitor 
and assess each risk. A combination of 
internal knowledge and external factors, 
such as horizon scanning, legal and 
regulatory developments, and emerging 
climate science, are considered to 
determine whether to mitigate, transfer or 
accept climate-related risks. In some 
cases, it may be deemed appropriate to 
transfer the risk, for example by discharging 
costs or liability to another party in our 
value chain. Part of the risk assessment 
process is also acceptance: establishing a 
level of comfort with the risk, considering 
our existing control strategies, and 
considering them currently sufficient.

Our resilience to climate change
As outlined in the climate-related risks on 
pages 27 – 31, the quantitative scenario 
analysis indicates that our business is not 
at high risk of significant financial impacts 
arising from climate-related risks in the 
short-term. Any climate-related risks with 
a medium-risk financial impact are either 
projected to occur in the long-term or 
have already been addressed through 
our mitigating actions. As a result, we do 
not anticipate the need for major changes 
to our strategy in order to respond to 
these risks.

In the medium and long-term, we will need 
to consider transition risks. The transition 
to a low-carbon economy could have 
financial implications for Haleon, as 
consumer preferences shift towards 
sustainable products, potentially impacting 
our market share and brand reputation. 
Additionally, increased carbon taxes on 
emissions across our operations and 
supply chain could also have financial 
impacts. However, these risks can be 
mitigated if we achieve our carbon 
reduction targets for emissions across 
all scopes. We have already conducted 
life-cycle assessments for 11 key products 
to better understand and mitigate the 
risks associated with their life-cycle 
stages. You can read more in our Climate 

Action Transition Plan, which is consistent 
with the strategy outlined in this disclosure, 
and goes into further detail.

In the long-term, we need to be aware 
of the impacts of physical risks. Our key 
facilities could be affected by flooding 
and heatwaves, leading to disruption 
and damage. Our Oral Health product line 
could also be impacted by disruptions in 
the supply of raw materials, particularly 
wheat and corn, which are at a higher risk 
of yield impact due to long-term climate 
change. While we already have a resilient 
sourcing strategy for these key crops, we 
need to continue monitoring the situation. 

The transition to a low-carbon economy 
also presents an opportunity for Haleon, 
as consumer preferences shift towards 
more sustainable products. In order to 
capitalise on this opportunity, we need 
to improve the sustainability of our 
products and make consumers aware 
of these changes through substantiated 
consumer messaging. See page 123 for 
more information on how the impact 
of climate change was considered in 
financial planning.

Climate-related scenario analysis 
Climate-related scenario analysis is 
used to assess the potential impact of 

climate-related risks and opportunities. 
In 2022, we performed our first qualitative 
analysis which we refreshed in 2023, both 
qualitatively and quantitatively, to assess 
the risks and opportunities in greater 
detail and understand the impact of 
climate change on our existing business 
model. The results have been used to 
inform our strategy and financial planning, 
including updates to our underlying cash 
flows for our planned actions to meet 
our climate ambitions. 

We worked with a climate analytics 
company, Risilience, to quantify the 
potential financial impact of our 
physical and transition climate risks 
and opportunities. Risilience used a 
‘Digital Twin’, which is a data-driven digital 
representation of our business and value 
chain. This used data from our business 
including current and approved financial 
projections, market breakdown, key 
facilities, raw materials and GHG footprint, 
to stress test and quantify the potential 
financial impact of climate risks and 
opportunities under different scenarios. 

The climate scenarios used as part of 
the analysis are outlined below. We also 
modelled a 2.5oC warming trajectory but 
are disclosing the results with the highest 
potential impact.

No Policy: Reversal of

and abolishment of 
climate policy leading 
to extreme warming. 

Enables us to test our business strategy against the most optimistic scenario from a 
climate-transition perspective.

Aligns with our target to be a net zero business by 2040, aligned to guidance from 
The Climate Pledge and Race to Zero.

Aligns with TCFD and IPCC1 recommendations to include a 2°C or lower scenario, with 1.5°C 
scenario recommended as the ‘2°C or lower’, aligning with the latest scientific research 
from the IPCC. 

This scenario represents the ‘worst case’/highest potential for transition risk for our business. 

Enables us to test business strategy against the worst-case scenario from a physical 
risk perspective.

This scenario was used in our qualitative analysis in 2022.

A number of assumptions were made 
in carrying out the analysis:
 — Current mitigating actions were not 
modelled for any of the scenarios.

 — All scenarios were modelled 

independently, i.e., no correlation 
was assumed between different risks 
and opportunities. 

 — Investment costs required to 

realise opportunities were not 
taken into account.

While many scenario models and 
techniques are advanced, we recognise 
that knowledge in this area is growing, 
and we expect models and pathways to 

evolve with time. Models also have 
limitations, and there are certain areas 
which are challenging to model. 
Additionally, in certain situations, 
different models can project contrasting 
results. In these situations, we have 
considered how different outcomes 
would impact our businesses.

1  We used the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to assess physical climate risk. RCPs are commonly used by climate scientists to assess physical climate risk, 

with each pathway representing a different GHG concentration trajectory which can then be translated into global warming impacts. We used climate data from the World Climate 
Research Programmes Coupled Model Intercomparison Project – Phase 6 (CMIP 6 – adjusted for spatial resolution and bias corrected) to do this translation. RCPs feed into climate, 
crop and flood models. There are four RCP pathways with RCP8.5 representing the worst case scenario.

Impact of climate-related risks 
and opportunities and resilience 
of our strategy
For 2023, we have updated the time 
horizons used to consider the impact of 
climate risks and opportunities. The length 
of the time horizons was reduced to allow 
greater alignment to modelling capabilities 

for quantitative scenario analysis and to 
reduce the risk of modelling uncertainties 
associated with using time horizons 
beyond 2050. This provides more accurate 
results compared to using longer time 
horizons and aligns with our business 
risk cycles, allowing us to use the analysis 
for strategic decision making.

We define short, medium and long-term 
horizons as follows:

 — Short-term (0-4 years): aligns to 
our financial planning and risk 
management framework. 

 — Medium-term (5-9 years): aligns to 

our interim Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions 
reduction targets of 2030. 

 — Long-term (10+ years): aligns to our 
net zero target of 2040 and the UK 
Government’s net zero target of 2050.

The following climate risks and opportunities have been identified as those with the potential to be significant to our business over 
the short, medium and long-term. For each risk and opportunity, further details are only provided for the scenario analysis with the 
most significant impact to Haleon. The risks and opportunities as presented integrated several components of TCFD: strategy, risks, 
and metrics and targets.

Potential impacts included in our Paris Ambition (1.5°C) 
and No Policy (4°C) scenario analysis included: 
 — Revenue disruption from the interruption of supply of 

electricity, gas and water, due to heatwaves and flooding. 

 — Inefficiencies in production due to disrupted 
employee travel, e.g., caused by flooding. 
 — Increased facility and operational down time, 
due to damaged transport infrastructure. 

 — Direct damage to stock, buildings, and contents 

from flood and windstorms.

Under a No Policy (4°C) scenario, the hazards with the 
greatest potential to impact our business are riverine 
and flash flooding, and heatwaves, over the long-term 
time horizon. Three of our sites, Guayama (Puerto Rico), 
Tianjin (China) and Dungarvan (Ireland), are at greatest 
risk of property damage from riverine flooding owing 
to their close proximity to rivers. 

Sites in the US, southern Europe and eastern China are 
located in regions that could experience a rapid increase in 
heatwave probability driven by global average temperatures 
and the likelihood of prolonged extreme temperature events. 
Heatwaves have the potential to cause disruption through 
interrupting our supply chain (such as from infrastructure 
damage to the road and rail network) as well as reducing the 
productivity of our workforce through human health impacts. 

The risk of water stress is considered to be low with 0.4% 
of annual revenue from our owned sites being potentially 
impacted in the long-term (by 2050). 

Assumptions: 
 — 2023 financial values are kept constant up to 2050 and 
acute physical risk shocks were applied to these values. 
 — The revenue share for our sites was assumed to be site 
revenue as a proportion of total revenue. The remaining 
revenue share was split proportionally across third-party 
manufacturers’ sites. 

 — Meteorological conditions that could lead to water stress 
(i.e., severe drought) were considered. Local geological 
conditions were excluded from the analysis.

Actions:
 — Production sites are included within a 

loss-prevention survey programme and are 
routinely visited to ensure appropriate 
resilience measures are in place, including 
flood, wind and storm protection. 

 — Our manufacturing sites have emergency 

plans, disaster recovery plans, and business 
continuity plans (BCPs), which we continuously 
improve to further enable our sites to 
withstand extreme weather events. 
 — Our BCPs include options for multiple 

sourcing for manufacturing of our products. 
This is achieved by using a combination 
of Haleon or third-party manufacturing 
organisations’ sites, spread across 
different geographies. 

 — We conducted value-chain water footprint 
analysis to better understand potential 
water-related risks in specific geographies 
and prioritise actions. 

 — All our manufacturing sites are implementing 

the AWS standard to address local 
water-related risks and opportunities. 
In 2023, our Cape Town site was 
recommended for certification; it also 
became water neutral following water 
replenishment activities, which began in 
2022 with WWF South Africa. 

Metrics and targets:
 — All our manufacturing sites in water-stressed 

basins to be water neutral by 2030. 
We consider water neutral achieved 
when the amount of water replenished 
in the catchment exceeds the site’s 
water withdrawal.

 — AWS certifications at our manufacturing 

sites by 2025.

 — We aim to introduce additional metrics from 
2024 to further track owned and third-party 
sites’ exposure to extreme weather events.

implications and price volatility.

 — Supply shortages which could prevent or limit the 
production of key product lines and lead to a loss 
in revenue.

 — Increased costs due to long-term chronic drought 

affecting crop supply and implementation of adaptation 
measures such as irrigation solutions. 

Scenario analysis was conducted to assess the financial 
impact of crop yield fluctuations caused by long-term 
climate change for our key crops. Changes in rainfall and 
temperature were assessed using data on crop sourcing 
locations and crop vulnerability. The effects of sudden 
hazards like heatwaves and droughts on crops were also 
assessed, considering the sourcing locations with a high 
likelihood or increasing probability of such events. 

Changes in long-term precipitation and temperature patterns 
under the No Policy (4°C) scenario are likely to affect wheat 
and corn sourcing, with wheat experiencing the largest 
average percentage yield decline of c.37% between 2023 
and 2050. Our key sourcing regions for these crops (France, 
US and UK) could also be impacted by extreme weather 
events, such as drought or severe heatwave events, further 
reducing crop yields. 

In our Oral Health products, corn is a crucial ingredient. 
However, the projected impact on corn yields in 2050 is 
anticipated to be minimal, accounting for less than 3% of the 
total revenue generated by Oral Health products in 2023. 

Under the No Policy (4°C) scenario, certain areas of 
central US may see corn yields decline as a result of 
precipitation variation.

Assumptions: 
 — 2023 financial values are kept constant up to 2050 and 
acute physical risk shocks are applied to these values. 
 — The impact of climate conditions on raw material supply is 
limited to temperature and precipitation. Other conditions, 
such as soil quality, were excluded from the analysis. 
 — Revenue impacts were considered in terms of reduced 
crop yields leading to production limitations. Price 
fluctuations were not considered in the analysis.

Actions:
 — Seek to assess feasibility of substituting raw 
materials with lower-risk alternatives, for 
example replacing corn-derived ingredients 
with alternatives to reduce exposure to 
yield and cost fluctuations. 

 — We have a robust sustainable sourcing 

strategy in place (see page 23).

 — Our sourcing strategy involves multiple 

sourcing options from different geographies 
and holding materials’ safety stocks where 
feasible. Continuity of supply is a priority for 
our procurement team. 

 — Haleon has defined and launched its Supplier 
ESG Expectations, which outlines the targets 
we have set our suppliers, such as requiring 
materials to be covered by industry-recognised 
certifications where relevant. 

 — Sustainability requirements are embedded 

into tender processes.

Metrics and targets:
 — We aim for all of our key agricultural, forest, 

and marine-derived materials to be sustainably 
sourced and deforestation-free by 20301. 
For the key material supply chains in scope 
of this goal, we use recognised global 
certification programmes wherever possible, 
for example Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 
Oil (RSPO) Mass Balance certification for our 
palm oil derivatives, and Forest Stewardship 
Council (FSC) and Programme for the 
Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) 
certifications for our paper packaging 
materials. Where these are not available, 
we are working with independent experts 
to define clear standards and processes for 
sustainable sourcing based on the specific 
issues and opportunities for each material.

1  Scope includes Haleon’s globally managed spend on key materials that are agricultural, forest, or marine-derived. Globally managed spend covers the majority of our internal spend 

and expands across some of our third-party manufacturing network.

Policy: carbon pricing

The financial impacts 
of carbon taxes on 
emissions across our 
operations and 
supply chain.

Potential impacts included in our Paris Ambition (1.5°C) 
scenario analysis included the following (the No Policy 
(4°C) scenario was not relevant): 
 — Direct increase to overhead costs from Scope 1 and 2 

emissions (e.g., cost of electricity and fuel). 

 — Increased cost of raw materials from upstream suppliers 
passing through increased costs from Scope 3 emissions.

Actions:
 — Delivery of our carbon emissions reduction 

targets for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 carbon 
emissions as outlined in our Climate Action 
Transition Plan will mitigate our operations’ 
exposure to future carbon pricing and 
environmental taxation. 

 — Reduction in sales from passing the costs from carbon 

 — We work with our suppliers and through 

industry groups like Manufacture 2030 and 
Energize to help suppliers map their carbon 
emissions and take actions to reduce their 
carbon footprint. 

Metrics and targets:
 — Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 carbon 

emissions by 95% by 2030 vs a 2020 baseline.
 — Reduce Scope 3 carbon emissions from source 
to sale by 42% by 2030 vs a 2022 baseline1.
 — Achieve net zero carbon emissions from source 
to sale by 2040, aligned to guidance from the 
Climate Pledge and Race to Zero1.

Not applicable

Under a Paris Ambition (1.5°C) scenario where global carbon 
prices are expected to grow significantly from 2023, the 
potential impact is a medium risk if we do not reach our 
SBTi-aligned target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. However, 
if we meet our SBTi target, the risk is significantly reduced as 
we aim to achieve at least 95% absolute Scope 1 and 2 
emissions reduction by 2030 (vs a 2020 baseline). 

Indirect Scope 3 emissions account for the majority of our 
exposure to carbon costs, particularly upstream emissions 
associated with farming and processing, which could be 
passed on by our suppliers. We have limited ability to 
influence these costs as they will depend on the extent to 
which suppliers reflect carbon tax expenditure within prices. 
The risk of indirect Scope 3 costs will be greatly reduced 
if we are able to meet our commitment to reduce Scope 3 
emissions by 42% by 2030 (vs a 2022 baseline) and deliver 
our net zero target by 2040, aligned to guidance from 
Race to Zero and Amazon Climate Pledge. 

Assumptions: 
 — Business as usual emissions trajectory where emissions 

grow proportionally to revenue growth.

 — Linear trajectories were used between scenario data points 
to estimate climate pricing data for intervening years.
 — All global emissions are subject to carbon pricing and no 

border adjustments were included in the analysis. 

 — No risk is assumed under a No Policy (4°C) scenario. This 
is due to this scenario representing a reversal of current 
policies including currently implemented carbon prices. 
 — Carbon price used in the analysis (2027 weight average 

carbon price (USD/tonne): $83.45. Carbon prices used in 
analysis were collated from sources such as the IMF, IEA 
and NGFS.

1  Our net zero and Scope 3 carbon emissions targets span carbon emission categories from source to sale (excluding GHG protocol categories 6, 7 and 10-15).

Potential impacts included in our Paris Ambition (1.5°C) 
and No Policy (4°C) scenario analysis included: 
 — Reduction in product sales and loss in market share.
 — Reputational damage and reduction in brand loyalty.

Under a Paris Ambition (1.5°C) scenario, it is expected that 
consumers will rapidly shift towards more sustainable 
products. The unmitigated potential risk to our business is 
considered to be medium. The majority of potential revenue 
loss is driven by our Oral Health products which represent 
the largest share of total revenue. Oral Health product 
consumers in the US are likely to see a rapid shift towards 
more sustainable products. 

Assumptions:
 — Buying preferences will vary at differing rates across 

global regions.

 — To model demand shifts of our products, consumer-led 
demand for sustainable packaging was used as a proxy. 

 — The risk was modelled under a scenario where we do 
not act to improve the sustainability of our products, 
in order to analyse the unmitigated impact of consumer 
demand shifts. 

Actions:
 — To meet or exceed the expectations of Haleon’s 
key stakeholders, including consumers, we are 
committed to deliver on our responsible 
business strategy and targets (page 23). 

 — We have carried out life-cycle assessments for 
11 key products to better identify the risks and 
opportunities across the life-cycle stages. 

 — Haleon’s sustainability impact assessment tool  
enables our R&D teams to calculate, analyse 
and compare the impact of product and 
packaging design decisions on key 
environmental-impact parameters (including 
carbon footprint and packaging). 

 — We are participating in externally verified 

sustainable choice ranges such as Amazon’s 
‘Climate Pledge Friendly’ programme as well as 
making substantiated statements in relation to 
our products’ sustainability credentials. 

 — With a focus on health inclusivity, our brands 
seek to tackle specific barriers that stand in 
the way of better everyday health. This includes 
empowering consumers and Health 
Professionals to better understand the impact 
of climate change on health and equip both 
with tools and solutions to manage and 
mitigate the impact on everyday health. 

Metrics and targets:
 — Haleon has set targets with an aim to respond 

to changing consumer preferences, for 
example our aims for 100% of product 
packaging to be recycle-ready by 2025 and 
recyclable by 2030 where safety, quality and 
regulations permit, and to reduce our use of 
virgin petroleum-based plastic packaging by 
10% by 2025 and by a third by 2030 vs a 2022 
baseline. See page 23 for our performance. 
Where relevant, we incorporate environmental 
credentials into consumer-facing statements or 
listings in retailers’ sustainable choices ranges.

Potential impacts included in our Paris Ambition (1.5°C) 
and No Policy (4°C) scenario analysis included: 
 — Changing consumer demand to low-carbon alternatives 
leading to a gain in market share and an increase in 
product sales.

 — Positive reputational impacts and increasing brand loyalty.

The potential market opportunity for more sustainable 
products could be significant under a Paris Ambition (1.5°C) 
scenario, equating to 2.6% additional revenue in 2032, 
compared to baseline projected revenues. Consistent with 
the risk above, the greatest potential for upside is driven by 
our Oral Health products. 

The size of the potential opportunity decreases in the long 
term, as more products align with consumer preferences and 
take actions to meet future climate targets. Therefore, the 
opportunity reduces for product groups which have already 
seen a sustainable shift. 

Assumptions: 
 — Buying preferences will vary at differing rates across 
global regions. To model demand shifts for Haleon’s 
products, consumer-led demand for sustainable 
packaging was used as a proxy. 

 — The opportunity was modelled under a future where 

we work to improve the sustainability of our products 
in order to understand the potential financial gains that 
could be realised. 

Actions:
 — Our actions are consistent with management 
of the risk of changing consumer preferences. 

Metrics and targets:
 — Haleon has set targets with an aim to 

respond to changing consumer preferences, 
for example our aims for 100% of product 
packaging to be recycle-ready by 2025 and 
recyclable by 2030 where safety, quality and 
regulations permit, and to reduce our use of 
virgin petroleum-based plastic packaging by 
10% by 2025 and by a third by 2030 vs a 2022 
baseline. See page 23 for our performance. 
Where relevant, we incorporate environmental 
credentials into consumer-facing statements or 
listings in retailers’ sustainable choices ranges. 

Metrics and targets
We have made significant progress in 
establishing our standalone responsible 
business strategy as a separately listed 
company (following listing in July 2022). 
This has included the development of 
targets, associated delivery plans to 
meet targets, and performance and risk 
management forums and processes. 
As outlined in this disclosure, we have 
developed metrics alongside our scenario 
analysis which are used to monitor certain 
risks and opportunities. This includes 
cross-industry metrics and targets 
recommended by TCFD, which can be 
found mapped to risks and opportunities 
on pages 27-31, in key performance 
indicators on pages 32-33, in our Scope 1, 2 
and 3 emissions set out in line with the UK 
Government’s guidance on Streamlined 
Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) on 
pages 188-189, and built into our ESG 
Qualifier as described on pages 33 and 83.

In August 2023, the Science Based Targets 
initiative validated our near-term target 
to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions by 95% by 2030 from a 2020 
base year4. We are also committed to 
reducing absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions 
from purchased goods and services, 
capital goods, fuel and energy-related 
activities, upstream transportation 
and distribution, waste generated in 
operations, upstream leased assets 
and downstream transportation and 
distribution by 42% versus our 2022 
baseline within the same time frame. 
This target, based on its original 2020 
baseline, was also validated by the Science 
Based Targets initiative. As described on 
page 22, we have updated the baseline 
year for our carbon Scope 3 and virgin 
plastic reduction goals from 2020 to 2022. 
We will re-submit our Scope 3 target with 
its updated 2022 baseline for revalidation 
this year.

Our 2023 performance is described 
on pages 22-23. Performance against these 
targets, along with additional 
environmental metrics and reporting 
methodologies, can be found on 
our website. 

Priorities for 2024
After completing our quantitative 
scenario analysis at the end of 2023, our 
main focus for the upcoming year will be 
interpreting the findings and determining 
the appropriate mitigating actions and 
associated metrics and targets. 

In line with our journey to meet our 
net zero ambition, as published within 
our Climate Action Transition Plan, we 
continue to develop and refine metrics 
to track and manage our transition risks 
and opportunities. It is Haleon’s plan to 
continue to evolve on this journey and 
publish additional metrics in 2024. We will 
also continue to develop our Climate 
Action Transition Plan over time to 
include a costed plan for our transition.

Our key performance indicators 

We have several enterprise metrics monitoring performance across the business, from which we select our key performance indicators 
(KPIs). These are the most applicable in tracking our strategic performance, sustainability and commitment to our key stakeholders. 
The Board and Executive Team monitor our KPIs to ensure continued alignment to our strategy and, where applicable, they are linked 
to Executive Directors’ remuneration. Having demerged from GSK in 2022, we are still in the process of building up five years of data.

Following the strong strategic progress made since our de-merger, Haleon has reviewed its KPIs given a number of targets are within sight 
of delivery. Net debt/adjusted EBITDA will no longer be a KPI in 2024 given expected delivery of less than 3.0x leverage during 2024. 
The Company has a commitment to maintain an Investment-Grade balance sheet and operate at c.2.5x net debt/adjusted EBITDA over 
the medium term. Additionally, given Haleon’s commitment to active portfolio management and the recently announced disposals of 
Lamisil and ChapStick, the Board will now consider adjusted operating profit growth and adjusted operating margin on an organic basis 
(i.e. excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestments, and at constant currency) which will give a more direct representation of 
the Company’s performance. In addition, from 2024 we will focus on adjusted diluted EPS growth at constant currency to ensure value 
creation across the business. In responsible business, given our commitment on recycle-ready packaging will complete in 2025, we will 
replace this metric with reduction in virgin petroleum-based packaging, which will be included as part of the ESG qualifier in Haleon’s 
2024-2026 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards.

Elements of our Executive Director 
remuneration are linked to the delivery of

2023 Business review

Chief Financial Officer’s review

Tobias Hestler
Chief Financial Officer

I am pleased to report strong financial 
performance for 2023 demonstrating the 
continued resilience of our business. Since 
2021, the business has added £1.8bn of 
additional revenue, £1.0bn of adjusted 
gross profit and £0.4bn of adjusted 
operating profit driving strong cash 
generation. This meant we reached the 
initial leverage target outlined at our 
Capital Markets Day in February 2022, one 
year ahead of our expectation. We have 
therefore updated our capital allocation 
priorities and plan to return £500m to 
shareholders through buybacks in 2024.

Haleon is now on a journey to become 
more agile and consumer focused with 
a leading portfolio. During 2023, we 
examined our processes to ensure that 
they were fit for purpose and restructured 
where necessary. Additionally, we 
proactively managed our portfolio 
and agreed to divest both Lamisil and 
ChapStick which will drive more focus 
to our key growth areas.

I would like to thank everyone at Haleon 
for all their efforts across the business.

Profitable growth
For 2023, we reported revenue of £11.3bn 
(+4.1%), delivering organic revenue growth 
of 8.0%. Foreign exchange reduced revenue 
by (3.8)% and net M&A by (0.1)%. We saw 
broad-based organic growth demonstrating 
the long-term attractiveness of our brands 
and geographic footprint. Our strong 
execution in market meant that we were 
able to increase prices to help offset 
inflationary cost pressures, whilst also 
preserving volume growth. 

Our growth was profitable, with operating 
profit of £1,996m (+9.4%) and adjusted 
operating profit up 10.4% at constant 
currency reflecting strong operating 
leverage across the business. This drove 
adjusted operating margin growth of 
50bps at constant currency. Margin was 
down 20bps at actual exchange rates. EPS 
was 11.3p, and adjusted EPS was 17.3p, 
down 6.0% reflecting the annualisation 
of our interest charge given 2023 was our 
first full year as a standalone company.

Investments
We continued to ensure the business 
remains fully invested whilst being 
focused on cost discipline to deliver 
value. This included investments into 
our systems, processes and sales force. 
Our A&P spend was flat and up 3% at 
constant currency for the year. We drove 
further efficiencies in spend through 
agency consolidation and in-house 
production. Spend was targeted across 
advertising and expert engagement which 
delivered strong ROI. Advertising spend 
increased in key areas including Oral 
Health and VMS, and in important growth 
markets such as India and China.

Adjusted R&D expenditure totalled 
£297m (2022: £303m), representing a 
healthy level of spend into innovation. 
Our gross capital expenditure was 
£336m (2022: £328m) with spend focused 
on sales and marketing, manufacturing 
sites and technology, particularly in 
automation. 

Becoming agile and 
consumer focused
During the year, we announced a programme 
to increase agility and productivity across 
the business which will result in annualised 
gross cost savings of c.£300m, largely in 
2024 and 2025. We are on-track to 
deliver this through initiatives including 
restructuring. As a result, a number of 
employees have left the business as we 
de-layer functions, increase the speed of 
decision making and route to market. 

Haleon is also focused on proactively 
managing its portfolio and will remain 
rigorous and disciplined where there 
are opportunities. During 2023, we 
disposed of Lamisil for £235m, and 
reached an agreement to sell ChapStick 
for approximately $430 million, and a 
passive minority interest in Suave Brands 
Company, allowing Haleon to participate 
in further value creation of the brand. 
Both Lamisil and ChapStick are strong 
brands in their own right, but divesting 
allows us to reduce complexity, 
accelerate revenue growth, reduce 
debt and drive shareholder returns.

Driving shareholder returns
Since demerger, our strong free cash flow 
generation has allowed us to reduce net 
debt by over £2bn, finishing the year at 
£8.5bn with over £1bn of cash on hand. 
Our debt is staggered and secured at 
attractive rates. During 2023, we repaid 
$300m of our 2024 notes, one year early. 
We next have $700m due in March 2024 
with $1.75bn due in March 2025, both of 
which we expect to fund largely from our 
operational cash flows. 

Our leverage at the end of 2023 stood at 
3.0x net debt/adjusted EBITDA. Hence, 
leverage of less than 3x is in sight to be 
achieved during 2024. Given this, we have 
updated our capital allocation priorities. 
Haleon is now targeting to operate at 
around 2.5x net debt/adjusted EBITDA over 
the medium term. We believe that this is the 
right leverage to enable the business to 
appropriately balance our capital allocation 
priorities of continued investment for 
growth, explore acquisitions and return 
surplus capital to shareholders through 
dividends and share buybacks. 

Given these priorities, the Board has 
proposed a final dividend for 2023 of 4.2p 
per ordinary share and a total dividend of 
6.0p per ordinary share, which represents 
approximately 35% of our 2023 adjusted 
earnings. As a result, since demerger, Haleon 
will have returned £0.8bn in dividends 
to shareholders. Going forward, Haleon 
expects to grow its ordinary dividend at 
least in line with adjusted earnings. In 
addition, we expect to allocate capital 
of £500m to share buybacks in 2024. 
This reflects expected savings from our 
productivity programme, cash proceeds 
from announced disposals and 
accelerated progress in de-leveraging.

Looking ahead
I am encouraged by the strength and 
resilience of our business model to deliver 
superior shareholder returns. There is 
more to do as we become more agile and 
consumer focused. Nevertheless, I am 
confident Haleon will deliver another year 
of strong performance. This, combined 
with our capital allocation framework, 
will drive value for all our stakeholders.

2  For a discussion of the Group’s financial and operating performance for the year ending 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022, see Haleon’s 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F, 

pages 36-45, filed with the SEC on 20 March 2023.

3  Net M&A (predominately the disposal of Lamisil) includes the impact of Manufacturing Service Agreements (MSAs).

The tax charge on an adjusted basis was 
£512m (2022: £506m) and the effective 
tax rate on an adjusted basis was 
23.5% (2022: 22.3%).

Profit after tax and earnings per 
share
Profit after tax attributable to 
shareholders of the Group was £1,049m 
(2022: £1,060m), and adjusted profit 
after tax attributable to shareholders 
was £1,607m (2022: £1,700m), down 5.5% 
at AER and up 2.5% at constant currency. 
The increase at constant exchange rates 
was driven by 10.4% growth in adjusted 
operating profit which was partly offset 
by the annualisation of interest costs and 
the higher tax rate described above. 

This resulted in diluted earnings per share 
of 11.3p (2022: 11.5p) and adjusted diluted 
earnings per share of 17.3p (2022: 18.4p).

Revenue
Revenue increased 4.1% to £11,302m 
(2022: £10,858m). Adverse foreign 
exchange had a 3.8% impact on total 
revenue. This was largely driven by the 
Pound Sterling strengthening against the 
Argentine Peso, the Chinese Renminbi and 
other emerging market currencies. The net 
impact of M&A3 had a 0.1% adverse impact 
largely from the disposal of Lamisil which 
was completed in November 2023. 
Revenue grew 8.0% organically for 2023.

Gross profit 
Reported gross profit increased by 2.6% 
to £6,747m (2022: £6,577m) with gross 
margin down 90bps to 59.7%. Adjusted 
gross profit increased by 3.4% or 7.3% 
at constant currency to £7,001m (2022: 
£6,772m) with adjusted gross margin 
of 61.9% (2022: 62.4%). 

Adjusted gross profit was driven by 
pricing and ongoing supply chain, and 
manufacturing efficiency benefits. This 
helped offset higher commodity-related 
costs and cost inflation which particularly 
impacted performance in the first half. 
During the second half of the year, these 
headwinds eased resulting in growth in 
adjusted gross profit margin in the 
fourth quarter. 

Operating profit 
Operating profit increased by 9.4% to 
£1,996m (2022: £1,825m) and operating 
profit margin increased 90bps to 17.7% 
(2022: 16.8%). Adjusted operating profit 
increased by 3.1% to £2,549m (2022: 
£2,472m) or 10.4% at constant currency. 

Adjusted operating profit growth at 
constant currency was driven by strong 
revenue growth, partly offset by higher 
A&P spend and investments into our 
systems, processes and sales force. 
In addition, adjusted operating profit 
was impacted by higher commodity and 
raw material costs, and cost inflation.

Net finance costs 
Net finance costs were £368m (2022: 
£207m). This reflected finance costs of 
£402m (2022: £258m), primarily related 
to the annualisation of interest on the 
issuance of £9.2bn in notes in March 2022 
and finance income of £34m (2022: £51m). 

Tax charge 
The statutory tax charge of £517m (2022: 
£499m) represented an effective tax rate 
on reported results of 31.8% (2022: 
30.8%). The 2023 tax charge includes a 
£155m non-cash charge related to 
intragroup transfers. The 2022 tax charge 
included a £102m non-cash charge due to 
the revaluation of US deferred tax 
liabilities given the increase in the blended 
rate of US state taxes that applies due to 
the demerger.

Revenue was £4,195m (2022: £4,116m), a 
growth of 1.9% on a reported basis which 
included the negative effect of exchange 
rates of (0.8)%. There was no impact from 
net M&A. As a result, revenue grew 2.7% 
on an organic basis with +3.6% price and 
(0.9)% volume/mix. 

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange 
and net M&A, Oral Health revenue was up 
high-single digit in the year, with double 
digit growth in Sensodyne underpinned 
by strong performance from Sensodyne 
Pronamel Active Shield and Sensodyne 
Sensitivity & Gum. VMS declined mid single 
digit driven by weakness in the immunity 
subcategory resulting in a double digit 
decline in Emergen-C. Centrum declined 
low-single digit, largely driven by 
performance in the fourth quarter from 
retailer stocking patterns. Centrum Silver 
continued to see strong performance 
following the activation of cognitive 
function claims.

Respiratory Health revenue grew high-
single digit reflecting a strong cold and flu 
season at the start of the year combined 
with a normal seasonal sell-in and good 
consumption in the second half. Pain Relief 
grew low-single digit with strength in 
Excedrin and Voltaren partly offset by 
lower growth in Advil given the tough 
comparative from strength last year in 
Canada. Digestive Health and Other 
revenue was flat reflecting low-single 
digit growth in Digestive Health offset 
by a decline in Skin Health.

Adjusted operating profit increased 
3.5% at AER and 4.7% at constant currency 
driven by pricing, strong cost management 
and a one-time tax credit which more 
than offset significant cost inflation in 
material and labour costs across the 
region. Adjusted operating profit margin 
expanded 40bps at AER and 50bps at 
CER to 26.4%.

Geographically, Latin America, Middle East 
& Africa and Central and Eastern Europe all 
saw strong double digit revenue growth 
which was driven by price. Southern Europe 
was up high single digit with strength in 
Italy. Northern Europe was up mid-single 
digit with particularly strong performance in 
UK and recovered performance in Germany.

Adjusted operating profit increased 3.4% 
at AER and 12.6% at constant currency 
driven by pricing and operational efficiency 
improvements that more than offset 
inflationary cost pressures. The impact 
of divestments was most pronounced 
in this region, negatively impacting 
adjusted operating profit growth by 
80bps. Adjusted operating profit 
margin decreased by 70bps at AER to 
22.2% and increased 10bps at CER.

Revenue was £4,545m (2022: £4,270m), 
a growth of 6.4% on a reported basis 
which included the negative effect of 
foreign exchange (6.0)% and net M&A 
impact of (0.2)%. As a result, revenue grew 
+12.6% on an organic basis with +12.8% 
price and (0.2)% volume/mix. There was a 
c.3% impact to revenue from pricing in 
Turkey and Argentina, which impacted the 
overall Group by c.1%.

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange 
and net M&A, Oral Health, Respiratory 
Health, Digestive Health and Other all 
grew double digit. 

In Oral Health, revenue was supported 
by double digit growth across all three 
Power Brands, Sensodyne, parodontax 
and Polident/Poligrip. VMS saw low-single 
digit growth with double digit growth in 
Centrum partly offset by a decline in some 
Local Growth brands.

Pain Relief increased high-single digit 
driven by double digit growth in Panadol 
given strength in Northern and Central 
& Eastern Europe, and low-single digit 
growth in Voltaren due to good growth in 
Middle East & Africa and Southern Europe. 
Respiratory Health saw strong demand in 
Theraflu particularly in Central & Eastern 
Europe as well as double digit growth in 
Otrivin due to growth in Middle East and 
Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. 
In Digestive Health and Other, there was 
double digit growth in Digestive Health, 
Smokers Health and Skin Health. In Digestive 
Health, ENO was particularly strong, and in 
Skin Health Zovirax also saw strong growth.

Geographically, performance was 
particularly strong in China, and up 
double digit given strength in Fenbid 
and Contac at the start of the year. India 
saw high-single digit growth driven by 
continued strong growth in Sensodyne. 
Australia and New Zealand was up 
mid-single digit underpinned by Panadol 
performance and South East Asia & 
Taiwan also saw mid-single digit growth. 

Adjusted operating profit increased 6.9% 
at AER and 17.8% at constant currency 
driven by positive operating leverage from 
strong revenue growth combined with 
operational efficiencies which more than 
offset inflationary cost pressure. Adjusted 
operating profit margin increased by 
60bps at AER to 21.1% or 170bps at CER. 

Revenue was £2,562m (2022: £2,472m), 
a growth of 3.6% on a reported basis 
which included the negative impact of 
exchange rates of (5.4)%. As a result, 
revenue grew +9.0% on an organic basis 
with +2.7% price and +6.3% volume/mix. 

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange 
and net M&A, Respiratory Health and Pain 
Relief saw double digit growth. There was 
strong demand for Contac and Fenbid 
during the first half of the year, following 
the cessation of COVID-19-related 
lockdowns in China. Inventory in both 
these products were pro-actively managed 
in the second half of the year to normal 
pre-pandemic levels. In Pain Relief, 
performance was supported by Voltaren 
and Panadol with strong results in China 
and Australia respectively.

Oral Health grew mid-single digit driven 
by mid-single digit growth in Sensodyne, 
with double digit growth in India and 
mid-single digit growth in China. 
parodontax also delivered double digit 
growth. VMS grew mid-single digit with 
Centrum and Caltrate both up mid-single 
digit. Digestive Health and Other 
increased mid-single digit.

Oral Health 
Revenue was £3,136m (2022: £2,957m), 
a growth of +6.1% on a reported basis 
which included the negative effect of 
exchange rates of (4.5)%. This resulted 
in 10.6% organic growth.

VMS 
Revenue was £1,640m (2022: £1,675m), 
a decrease of (2.1)% on a reported basis 
which included the negative effect of 
exchange rates of (3.0)%. This resulted 
in 0.9% organic growth. 

Growth in revenue excluding the impact of 
foreign exchange was driven by Sensodyne 
with North America, Middle East and 
Africa, LatAm and India, all seeing double 
digit growth. Parodontax benefited from 
particularly healthy growth in Middle East 
and Africa and US. Denture Care growth 
was underpinned by strong performance 
from innovations such as Polident Max 
Hold+ and some recovery from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Elsewhere, 
Aquafresh saw mid-single digit growth 
driven by strong execution in-market.

Growth in revenue excluding the impact of 
foreign exchange and net M&A was driven 
by low-single digit growth with double 
digit growth in Centrum partly offset by a 
decline in some Local Growth brands. 
Centrum increased mid single digit with 
LatAm and China both up double digit. 
This partly offset a slight decline in North 
America driven mainly by weakness in the 
first half of the year. Caltrate increased 
mid-single digit driven by a similar level of 
growth in China. As expected, Emergen-C 
declined double digit in North America 
given the immunity category reversion to 
pre-COVID-19 levels, although the brand 
saw improved performance in Q4 up low 
single digit in the region.

Pain Relief
Revenue was £2,652m (2022: £2,551m), 
a growth of + 4.0% on a reported basis 
which included the negative effect of 
exchange rates of (3.2)% and net M&A 
impact of (0.2)%. This resulted in 7.4% 
organic growth.

Growth in revenue excluding the impact of 
foreign exchange and net M&A was driven 
by double digit growth in Panadol due to 
strength in Middle East and Africa and 
Australia supported by improved capacity. 
Voltaren grew mid-single digit with strong 
growth in the US, Central and Eastern 
Europe and Middle East and Africa. 

Advil grew low single digit and was 
impacted by more competitive market 
conditions in the second half of the year 
and a tough comparative from strong 
demand in Canada last year following 
the RSV surge and resulting surge in 
medication needs for children with 
Children’s Advil. 

Fenbid grew over 50% due to exceptional 
growth in H1 2023 due to the cessation 
of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, 
with inventory levels normalising in H2. 
Revenue declined in Q4 due to lapping the 
tough comparatives for Fenbid given strong 
growth in the prior year as COVID-19 
lockdowns ended in China.

cold and flu products saw low single digit 
organic growth in North America and 
double digit growth in EMEA & LatAm 
during the fourth quarter. Contac sales 
were particularly strong, mainly due to 
significant growth in China in H1 following 
the end of lockdowns at the end of 2022.

Allergy sales grew low single digit for the 
year. Theraflu and Otrivin both increased 
double digit, with strength in Central & 
Eastern Europe and Middle East & Africa.

Revenue excluding the impact of foreign 
exchange, was driven by mid single digit 
growth across the three areas in this 
product category comprising c.50% 
Digestive Health, c.25% Skin Health 
and c.25% Smoking Cessation brands.

Growth in Digestive Health was 
underpinned by strength in Tums, which 
was particularly strong in the fourth 
quarter following a recall in the same 
period in 2022. Eno also saw double digit 
growth that was partially offset by a 
decline in Nexium. In Skin Health, double 
digit growth in Bactroban was a key 
growth driver.

Indebtedness, liquidity and financial risk management

As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s 
long-term and short-term credit ratings 
were Moody’s: Baa1/P-2 and S&P: BBB/A-2.

separation costs which were offset by a 
full year of interest costs and increased 
restructuring costs. 

Indebtedness
At 31 December 2023, the Group’s total 
borrowings were £9,456m (2022: £10,440m), 
and the Group’s net debt was £8,514m 
(2022: £9,868m). 

Long-term financing consists of $8,448m 
in USD bonds, as well as €2,350m Euro 
bonds and £700m GBP bonds issued in 
March 2022 under a £10,000m Euro 
Medium Term Note programme. $302m of 
bond debt was repaid early in 2023 using 
cashflows from operations. Bond financing 
includes the $700m USD bond due March 
2024, now classified as short-term debt 
on the balance sheet.

Total borrowings/profit after tax was 8.3x 
and net debt/adjusted EBITDA was 3.0x 
as at 31 December 2023. Haleon expects 
to operate with leverage of around 2.5x 
net debt/adjusted EBITDA over the 
medium term. 

Cash generation
Net cash from operating activities totalled 
£2,100m in 2023 (2022: £2,063m). Free 
cash flow was £1,575m, a £4m decrease 
versus 2022, driven by an increase in 
operational cashflows and reduction in

Strategic Report

Liquidity
At 31 December 2023, the Group had total 
liquidity of £2,914m comprising £1,920m 
of bank facilities and £1,044m of cash 
and cash equivalents, less £50m of bank 
overdrafts. The Group has undrawn credit 
facilities of $1,300m (2022: $1,400m) with 
maturity date of September 2024 and 
£900m (2022: £1,000m) with maturity date 
of September 2026. As at 31 December 
2023, no amounts were drawn under these 
facilities (2022: nil). 

The Group uses short-term financing to 
manage working capital requirements and 
has access to a $10,000m US commercial 
paper programme and a £2,000m Euro 
commercial paper programme. There was 
no commercial paper outstanding as of 
31 December 2023 (2022: £302m). 

Management believes that the Group 
has sufficient working capital for present 
requirements and to minimise liquidity risk, 
the Group has policies to limit the amount 
of debt maturing in any year. In addition, 
policies require the Group to always 
maintain a minimum available liquidity, 
including undrawn revolving credit 
facilities and available cash, less 
commercial paper issued. 

Interest rate risk
The Group’s strategic priorities are to 
minimise interest costs and minimise 
income statement volatility arising from 
interest rates. 

The Group has a policy to limit the amount 
of floating rate debt it holds to manage 
the amount of income statement volatility. 
The Group will regularly assess its interest 
rate profile in light of changes to market 
interest rates. 

At 31 December 2023, 77% of debt was 
fixed with the balance being exposed 
to floating rates.

Foreign exchange translation risk
The Group’s policy is to manage Group 
net debt such that the currency mix of 
debt broadly aligns with the currency 
mix of earnings, considering relative 
interest costs and practical implications. 
The currency mix of debt includes the 
impact of foreign exchange and cross-
currency swaps.

Use of non-IFRS measures

Strategic Report

We use certain alternative performance measures (APMs) to make financial, 
operating, and planning decisions and to evaluate and report performance. 

We believe these measures provide 
useful information to investors and as 
such, where clearly identified, we have 
included certain alternative performance 
measures in this document to allow 
investors to better analyse our business 
performance and allow greater 
comparability. To do so, we have 
excluded items affecting the 

comparability of period-over-period 
financial performance. Adjusted results 
and other non-IFRS measures may be 
considered in addition to, but not as a 
substitute for or superior to, information 
presented in accordance with IFRS and 
may not be directly comparable with 
similar measures used by other companies. 

Additionally, we are unable to present 
reconciliations of forward-looking 
information for non-IFRS measures 
because we are unable to forecast 
accurately certain adjusting items 
required to present a meaningful 
comparable IFRS forward-looking 
financial measure. 

Changes to APMs
In 2023, we introduced organic operating 
profit growth as a new APM. Organic 
operating profit growth differs from our 
presentation of adjusted operating profit 
growth as it is further adjusted for the 
effects of acquisitions, divestments, MSAs, 
and exchange rates. Management believes 
that presenting organic operating profit 
growth contributes to the understanding 
of the Group’s performance in a meaningful 
and consistent way as well as aligning 
with our organic revenue growth measure. 
The new APM was effective from 1 January 
2023 but we have presented alongside 
2022 comparatives.

Beginning in 2024, our organic revenue 
growth calculation will cap pricing in excess 
of 26 percent per annum for countries 
experiencing hyperinflation. For Haleon, 
this will apply to Argentina and Turkey. 
Corresponding adjustments will be made 
to all income statement related lines when 
calculating organic growth changes.

Additionally, we are no longer presenting 
free cash flow conversion and net capital 
expenditure as APMs since they are 
simply a mathematical derivation of free 
cash flow in proportion to profit after 
tax and an aggregation of cash flow line 
items, respectively.

Adjusted results
Adjusted results comprise adjusted cost of 
sales, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross 
profit margin, adjusted selling, general and 
administration (SG&A), adjusted research 
and development (R&D), adjusted other 
operating income/(expense), adjusted 
operating expenses, adjusted operating 
profit, adjusted operating profit margin, 
adjusted net finance costs, adjusted profit 
before tax, adjusted income tax, adjusted 
effective tax rate, adjusted profit after tax, 
adjusted profit attributable to shareholders 
and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 

Adjusted results exclude net amortisation 
and impairment of intangible assets, 
restructuring costs, transaction-related 
costs, separation and admission costs, 
and disposals and others, in each case net 
of the impact of taxes (where applicable) 
(collectively, the adjusting items). 

We believe that adjusted results, when 
considered together with the Group’s 
operating results as reported under IFRS, 
provide investors, analysts and other 
stakeholders with helpful complementary 
information to understand the financial 
performance and position of the Group 
from period to period and allow the 
Group’s performance to be more 
easily comparable. 

Restructuring costs
From time to time, the Group may undertake 
business restructuring programmes that are 
structural in nature and significant in scale. 
The cost associated with such programmes 
includes severance and other personnel 
costs, professional fees, impairments of 
assets, and other related items. 

Transaction-related costs
Transaction-related accounting or 
other adjustments related to significant 
acquisitions including deal costs and other 
pre-acquisition costs when there is certainty 
that an acquisition will complete. It also 
includes costs of registering and issuing 
debt and equity securities and the effect 
of inventory revaluations on acquisitions. 

Adjusted results include the benefits 
of restructuring programmes but exclude 
significant costs (such as significant 
legal, restructuring and transaction items). 
They should not be regarded as a complete 
picture of the Group’s financial performance, 
which is presented in the Group’s reported 
results. The exclusion of other adjusting 
items may result in adjusted results being 
materially higher or lower than reported 
results. In particular, when significant 
impairments, restructuring charges and 
legal costs are excluded, adjusted results 
will be higher than reported results. 

Adjusting items
Adjusted results exclude the following 
items (net of the impact of taxes, 
where applicable):

Net amortisation and impairment 
of intangible assets
Net impairment of intangibles, impairment 
of goodwill and amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, excluding computer 
software. These adjustments are made 
to reflect the performance of the business 
excluding the effect of acquisitions. 

Use of non-IFRS measures

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Use of non-IFRS measures continued

Separation and admission costs
Costs incurred in relation to and in 
connection with separation, UK admission 
and registration of the Company’s ordinary 
shares represented by the Company’s 
American Depositary Shares (ADSs) under 
the US Exchange Act of 1934 and listing of 
ADSs on the NYSE (the US Listing). These 
costs are not directly attributable to the sale 
of the Group’s products and specifically 
relate to the foregoing activities, affecting 
comparability of the Group’s financial results 
in historical and future reporting periods. 

Disposals and others
Includes gains and losses on disposals 
of assets, businesses and tax indemnities 
related to business combinations, legal 
settlement and judgements, impact of 
changes in tax rates and tax laws on 
deferred tax assets and liabilities, retained 
or uninsured losses related to acts of 
terrorism, significant product recalls, 
natural disasters and other items. 

These gains and losses are not directly 
attributable to the sale of the Group’s 
products and vary from period to period, 
which affects comparability of the Group’s 
financial results. From period to period, the 
Group will also need to apply judgement if 
items of unique nature arise that are not 
specifically listed above.

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Strategic Report

Strategic Report

To calculate organic growth for the period, 
organic measures for the prior year are 
subtracted from organic measures in the 
current year and divided by organic 
measures in the prior year. 

Organic revenue growth by individual 
geographical segment is further discussed 
by price and volume/mix changes, which 
are defined as follows: 

 — Price: defined as the variation in 

revenue attributable to changes in 
prices during the period. Price excludes 
the impact to organic revenue growth 
due to (i) the volume of products 
sold during the period and (ii) the 
composition of products sold during 
the period. Price is calculated as current 
year net price minus prior year net price 
multiplied by current year volume. 
Net price is the sales price, after 
deduction of any trade, cash or volume 
discounts that can be reliably estimated 
at point of sale. Value added tax and 
other sales taxes are excluded from the 
net price. 

 — Volume/mix: defined as the variation 
in revenue attributable to changes in 
volumes and composition of products 
sold in the period.

Constant currency
The Group’s reporting currency is Pound 
Sterling, but the Group’s significant 
international operations give rise to 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
To neutralise foreign exchange impact and 
to better illustrate the change in results 
from one year to the next, the Group 
discusses its results both on an ‘as 
reported basis’ or using actual exchange 
rates (AER) (local currency results 
translated into Pound Sterling at the 
prevailing foreign exchange rate) and using 
constant currency exchange rates (CER). 
To calculate results on a constant currency 
basis, prior year exchange rates are used 
to restate current year comparatives. 
The principal currencies and relevant 
exchange rates in the key markets where 
the Group operates are shown below.

Organic revenue growth and 
organic operating profit growth
Our organic growth measures take our 
adjusted results and further exclude the 
impact of divestments, acquisitions, 
MSAs relating to divestments and closure 
of production sites, and the impact of 
foreign currency exchange movements 
from one period to the next. The Group 
believes discussing organic revenue 
growth and organic operating profit 
growth contributes to the understanding 
of the Group’s performance and trends 
because it allows for a year-on-year 
comparison of revenue and operating profit 
in a meaningful and consistent manner.

Organic measures are calculated period to 
period as follows, using prior year exchange 
rates to restate current year comparatives:

 — Current year organic measures exclude 

revenue and operating profit from brands 
or businesses acquired in the current 
accounting period. 

 — Current year organic measures exclude 

revenue and operating profit attributable 
to brands or businesses acquired in the 
prior year from 1 January to the date 
of completion of the acquisition.
 — Prior year organic measures exclude 

revenue and operating profit in respect 
to brands or businesses divested or 
closed in the current accounting period 
from 12 months prior to the completion 
of the disposal or closure until the end 
of the prior accounting period. 

 — Prior year organic measures exclude 

revenue and operating profit in respect 
to brands or businesses divested or 
closed in the previous accounting 
period in full. 

 — Prior year and current year organic 
measures exclude revenue and 
operating profit attributable to MSAs 
relating to divestments and closure of 
production sites taking place in either 
the current or prior year, each an organic 
adjustment. These adjustments are 
made because these agreements are 
transitional in nature and, with respect 
to production site closures, include 
a ramp-down period in which revenue 
and operating profit attributable to 
MSAs gradually reduces several months 
before the production site closes.

Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit 
after tax excluding income tax, finance 
income, finance expense, adjusting items 
(as defined on page 43), depreciation of 
property, plant and equipment and right 
of use assets, amortisation of computer 
software, impairment of property, plant 
and equipment, right of use assets and 
computer software net of impairment 
reversals. Adjusted EBITDA does not 
reflect cash expenditures, or future 
requirements for capital expenditures 

or contractual commitments. Further, 
adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes 
in, or cash requirements for, working 
capital needs, and although depreciation 
and amortisation are non-cash charges, the 
assets being depreciated and amortised 
are likely to be replaced in the future and 
adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash 
requirements for such replacements. 

Adjusted EBITDA eliminates differences in 
performance caused by variations in capital 
structures (affecting net finance costs), 
tax positions (such as the availability of net 
operating losses against which to relieve 
taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible 
assets (affecting relative depreciation 
expense) and the extent to which intangible 
assets are identifiable (affecting relative 
amortisation expense). As a result, we 
believe that adjusted EBITDA provides 
useful information to understand and 
evaluate the Group’s operating results.

The reconciliation between profit after tax for the year and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended 31 December 2023, 31 December 2022 
and 31 December 2021 is provided below:

Free cash flow 
Free cash flow is calculated as net cash 
inflow from operating activities plus cash 
inflows from the sale of intangible assets, 
the sale of property, plant and equipment 
and interest received, less cash outflows 
for the purchase of intangible assets, the 
purchase of property, plant and equipment, 
distributions to non-controlling interests 
and interest paid. 

We believe free cash flow is meaningful to 
investors because it is the measure of the 
funds generated by the Group available for 
distribution of dividends, repayment of debt 
or to fund the Group’s strategic initiatives, 
including acquisitions. The purpose of 
presenting free cash flow is to indicate the 
ongoing cash generation within the control 
of the Group after taking account of the 
necessary cash expenditures for 

maintaining the capital and operating 
structure of the Group (in the form of 
payments of interest, corporate taxation 
and capital expenditure).

Net debt
Net debt at a period end is calculated as 
short-term borrowings (including bank 
overdrafts and short-term lease liabilities), 
long-term borrowings (including long-term 
lease liabilities), and derivative financial 
liabilities less cash and cash equivalents 
and derivative financial assets. 

We analyse the key cash flow items driving 
the movement in net debt to understand 
and assess cash performance and utilisation 
in order to maximise the efficiency with 
which resources are allocated. 

The analysis of cash movements in net 
debt allows management to more clearly 
identify the level of cash generated from 
operations that remains available for 
distribution after servicing the Group’s 
debt. In addition, the ratio of net debt 
to adjusted EBITDA is used by investors, 
analysts and credit rating agencies to 
analyse our operating performance in 
the context of targeted financial leverage.

Strategic Report

Our approach to risk

Strategic Report

We understand the challenges and uncertainties we face and 
take a proactive approach to risk management to maximise 
opportunities, drive informed commercial decision-making, 
and protect our people and assets.

Risk management framework
At Haleon, management of risk is firmly 
embedded in our strategy to achieve our 
long-term goals. We have a diverse range 
of risks and have appropriate processes 
and tools to identify risks before 
they materialise. 

We have simplified and embedded the 
risk management framework within the 
strategy and planning cycle, which ensures 
accountability for the identification, 
assessment, mitigation and monitoring of 
risks aligned with our strategic objectives. 
The framework supports information flow 
and open communication between the 
Board, the Audit & Risk Committee (ARC), 
the Executive Team, our functions, 
business units, markets and sites. 

Our framework defines the essential 
elements of the Group’s approach to risk 
management and compliance programmes, 
ensuring risks associated with conducting 
business activities are effectively controlled, 
in line with the Board’s risk appetite and 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 

The framework is aligned to the three 
lines model which assigns roles and 
responsibilities for the management 
of risks within Haleon. 

Risk governance
The Board has ultimate accountability 
for managing the Group’s risks and setting 
our risk appetite in line with our strategic 
objectives. The Board ensures appropriate 
oversight through various mechanisms, 
including strategy meetings, management 
reports and reviews of selected risk areas. 

To assist the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities, the ARC is responsible for 
reviewing and assessing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems, covering the 
Group’s enterprise risks, financial and 
operational controls and procedures.

Our approach to risk continued

The Executive Team is joined by the 
Heads of Audit & Risk and Ethics & 
Compliance to form the Enterprise Risk and 
Compliance Committee (ERCC). The ERCC 
meets quarterly and ensures that risks 
are adequately managed, and the risk 
management framework is effectively 
deployed throughout the Group. The ERCC 
discusses enterprise and emerging risks, 
reviews industry trends, regulatory 
developments, high-profile incidents 
and critical audit findings. Each enterprise 
risk is owned by an ERCC member, who is 
accountable for designing and implementing 
risk mitigation strategies and regularly 
reporting risk updates to the ARC 
and ERCC. 

At a functional, business unit, market 
and site level, regular risk review meetings 
ensure a more granular review of risk and 
operationalisation of strategic priorities. 

These governance forums provide the 
ERCC with a bottom-up view of risks 
and issues along with oversight of how 
the key risks are being managed. Open 
communication and adequate reporting 
remain essential to ensure Haleon’s 
leaders maintain a sound risk culture 
and are kept informed to allow for swift 
decisions and meaningful actions. 

An annual management confirmation review 
across each business unit and function 
ensures key risks are well managed and that 
corrective and preventative actions are in 
place to address any significant gaps. 

Assessing risk 
We continuously assess and evaluate the 
risks posed by the changing environments 
in which we operate to ensure an 
appropriate, measured, and timely response 
by considering potential impacts and most 
likely scenarios. 

The annual enterprise risk assessment 
(ERA) for 2023 included a risk survey and 
interviews with the Board, Executive Team 
and business unit general managers to 
identify and evaluate both current and 
emerging risks, and to inform the 2024 
internal audit plan. The ERA outcome also 
reflects on whether we think the impact 
and likelihood associated with each of our 
enterprise risks are increasing or decreasing. 

The top-down process is complemented 
by horizon scanning to identify external 
trends, and inputs from risk review 
meetings at all levels of the organisation 
help us identify opportunities and/or 
emerging risks. 

The ERA results have been shared with the 
ARC and the Board to confirm the principal 
risks and agree on the Group’s risk 
management priorities for 2024. 

Our principal risks 
Our principal risks are a subset of our 
enterprise risks and are deemed by the 
Board to be the most significant risks 
faced by the Group, including those that 
can materially impact our performance 
and/or reputation and could threaten our 
long-term business model or liquidity. 

Our principal risks remain unchanged 
from the previous year and are not listed 
in any particular order and do not comprise 
an exhaustive list of risks associated with 
the business. While a robust assessment of 
these risks has been undertaken, additional 
risks not known to the Board or assessed 
to be less significant may also materialise 

and result in an adverse effect on the 
business. Haleon also faces other enterprise 
risks that we manage as part of our 
integrated risk management framework 
and include health and safety, product 
quality, product user safety, financial, 
and legal and compliance.

Growth model

Our success 
depends on our 
ability to identify 
and explore business 
opportunities to 
deliver organic 
growth.

Description and risk development

Mitigation

Failure to meet our medium-term organic growth 
objectives due to inadequate strategic and/or financial 
planning, lack of innovation, and deficient execution could 
result in erosion of shareholder value and damage to 
our reputation. 

The potential room for growth given the limited penetration 
of some categories and the fit of consumer health care with 
the consumer’s needs and social demographic trends will 
continue to attract competitors at a global and local level. 
This exposes us to the risk of our product portfolio not 
being aligned to consumer needs or demands, and 
innovation not being responsive to competitor offerings, 
changes in consumer preference or market structure. 

In addition, the risk of increasing customer concentration, 
market consolidation and shifts in sales channel structures 
can lead to increasing pressure on pricing and margins. 

This risk remains unchanged from 2022.

>>  See also our business model on page 8.

We have implemented a clear strategy to achieve our 
organic growth objectives by increasing household 
penetration and capitalising on new and emerging 
opportunities. This is underpinned by a granular 
understanding of consumer’s habits and needs. 
We continuously review and benchmark our performance 
against competitors, analysing internal and external data 
when performing our annual business planning and 
budgeting process, and monthly business reviews. 

Our business unit leaders remain aligned to execute our 
growth strategy, capitalise on our Power Brands, expanding 
them across geographies and leading markets, and build 
our local strategic brands in markets. We follow an 
integrated forecast and demand planning process while 
keeping discipline in pricing drivers across markets and 
driving efficient commercial execution. Global and local 
teams are mobilised and functioning to deliver effective 
growth across all product portfolio categories. 

We remain resilient in our value proposition across sales 
channels, exploring opportunities to further enhance 
routes to market, profitability, market share and growing 
our digital capabilities.

Talent attraction and

to the success of 
Haleon as is the 
effectiveness of our 
operating structures.

Trusted ingredients

Haleon’s brands 
must reflect 
trusted science 
and ingredients 
to consumers.

Description and risk development

Mitigation

Inability to attract, develop and retain a diverse range 
of skilled employees as we deliver a fit for the future 
organisation in a highly competitive market, which 
could have an impact on our ability to achieve our 
strategic objectives. 

We continuously work to attract and retain the best talent. 
Our annual Haleon employee survey continued to show 
high-level participation (84%) and provided valuable 
insights that will drive our actions and improve our 
reputation as a desirable workplace. 

If we do not execute effective talent management 
processes, including career progression and driving people 
engagement, we will not be successful in establishing 
a strong employer brand and ultimately affect our ability 
to have a workforce that is realising its full potential. 

Failing to pursue a fit for the future, efficient organisation 
in a fast-paced environment could impair the achievement 
of our objectives. 

This risk remains unchanged from 2022.

>>  See also our culture and people section from page 18.

Loss of customer confidence due to not pursuing 
best-in-class science or not monitoring and responding 
to emerging ingredient data and changes in consumer 
perception of product ingredients could negatively impact 
our brands and our reputation. 

The regulatory and public scrutiny of the safety, efficacy, 
purity and potential environmental impact of ingredients 
in healthcare products remains a key area of focus. 
Failure to actively monitor ingredient-related risks and 
address emerging ingredient regulations and industry 
and market trends can negatively impact our business 
and reputation. Our priority areas include: responsible 
practices to address active pharmaceutical ingredients 
in the environment; appropriate use of titanium dioxide 
inclusive of nanomaterials; and monitoring the potential 
for nitrosamine formation in our products. We take these 
responsible business actions to ensure our products 
are safe when used as directed and compliant with 
existing regulations. 

This risk has increased in 2023 to reflect the rapidly 
increasing pressure and scrutiny from governments, 
regulators, NGOs and consumers over the safety and 
efficacy of ingredients within consumer 
healthcare products. 

We continue our activities enhancing leadership standards, 
implementing a new performance management process 
and embedding our culture. 

Our employer value proposition initiatives through social 
media channels continue to further develop our corporate 
brand and reputation. We remain active in strengthening 
our talent acquisition processes. 

We remain committed to being a modern employer, 
with a DEI strategy and investment in employee 
experience activities.

We continue to develop our structures in a way that 
will deliver a fit for the future, fast-paced consumer 
organisation that is capable of enabling growth. 

Our approach and success as a global consumer health 
company is underpinned by our understanding of the 
evolving science of ingredients and deep human 
understanding of consumer needs and preferences. 

We have extensive controls in place designed to evaluate 
benefits and risks and identify potential concerns about 
ingredients. Whenever we introduce a new ingredient into 
our portfolio, we conduct an independent evidence-based 
review of the ingredient’s safety. 

We manage ingredient-related risks through an established 
trusted ingredients framework, enabling us to collect 
intelligence from multiple external sources, anticipating 
and detecting early signals to inform our approach and 
action plans to tackle ingredient risk. 

We have cross-functional dedicated resources across 
Haleon that provide expertise in informing our choices 
of active ingredients and excipients/additives. We actively 
participate in industry associations to gain insights and 
to impact the environment we operate in for the benefit 
of consumers.

product-related issues, see page 196.

Description and risk development

Mitigation

Disruption or constraints in our global sourcing and supply 
network due to external or internal factors or insufficient 
capacity leading to the inability to meet consumer 
demand and desired service levels. 

We continue to focus on optimising our capacity to 
respond to future needs and deliver to customers and 
consumers efficiently, while adhering to local regulations 
and safety standards. 

The end-to-end supply chain has also been impacted by 
rising commodity and energy costs and remains a key area 
of focus.

We continue to invest in internal and third-party capacity 
and alternate raw material suppliers to support demand 
especially for Panadol, Emergen-C, Theraflu and Otrivin. 

This risk has increased in 2023, mainly in anticipation 
of the impact from ongoing and potential geopolitical 
and environmental factors. 

We continue to expand dual sourcing for the most critical 
raw materials to increase supply chain resilience and 
accommodate changes in our portfolio and geopolitical 
and market conditions. 

Crisis and business continuity management plans are 
in place and tested every year with different scenarios 
enabling teams to respond to incidents and identify 
opportunities for continuous improvement. We rely 
on transparent team communication to support swift 
decision-making towards recovering critical business 
functions and assets in the event of a disruption. 

Failure to address existing and emerging environmental, 
social and governance risks could materially damage 
our reputation leading to significant financial losses. 
Responsible performance is critical to our investors, 
customers, consumers and employees. 

Being a responsible business is central to Haleon’s 
strategy and purpose, and is underpinned by robust 
Executive Team sponsorship, governance processes 
and overseen by the Environmental & Social 
Sustainability Committee. 

We are partially reliant on infrastructure changes 
and external factors to achieve our goals. Important 
dependencies include: the pace at which global energy 
supplies switch to renewables; the recycling industry 
developing technology to recycle small formats; the 
availability of responsibly and sustainably sourced or 
recycled materials; and the rapidly changing regulatory 
and legislative environment. 

The uncertain nature of climate change, governmental 
response and consumer behaviour bring additional 
challenges and opportunities.

While we continue to operate in a fast-moving external 
reporting and regulatory environment, the risk remains 
unchanged from 2022.

>>  See also our approach to sustainability from page 22, 

including our TCFD disclosure.

Our responsible business goals and policies cover the 
areas of highest impact materiality for Haleon, namely: 
carbon emissions; plastics and packaging; product 
quality; safety and health inclusivity. Our goals in these 
areas and for sustainable sourcing, waste and water are 
set using detailed analyses, benchmarking, and materiality 
assessments to ensure they are ambitious, relevant, and 
achievable. Our health inclusivity initiatives empower 
people to be more included in opportunities for better 
everyday health and strengthen our brand and corporate 
reputation with consumers, customers and other key 
stakeholders. 

We maintain and continue to develop collaborative 
relationships with external partners and organisations 
to find solutions for complex interconnected issues 
which require wider systems change. We closely monitor 
changes in consumer attitudes and behaviours, policy 
and regulatory developments and update our climate 
risk modelling and action plan regularly through our 
TCFD programme of work and disclosures.

landscape are

Description and risk development

Mitigation

Major disruption to our IT systems, including through cyber 
attacks, could materially impact our operations, harm our 
reputation and lead to significant financial losses. 

We see cyber attacks increasing in scope, scale and 
sophistication as geopolitical competition and conflict 
mounts. As our activities rely on digital services, such 
adversity could disrupt our global business, our research 
and development, supply chain and sales, and ultimately 
impact our results and reputation. 

The likelihood of such threats continues to be on the rise 
due to our public profile, use of third parties who support 
various activities, the increasingly dynamic geopolitical 
situation and our manufacturing processes relying on 
end-of-life equipment for some critical processes. 
Thus, cyber-security continues to be a key risk and 
we respond accordingly. 

This risk has increased since 2022 due to an increase 
in cyber attacks, phishing incidents and enhancements 
needed to Haleon’s infrastructure in order to comply with 
the US National Institute of Standards and Technology 
Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). 

Our focus remains on ensuring Haleon operates with secure, 
resilient IT systems and manages information adequately.

We operate and continuously improve the maturity of our 
technology control framework. We continue to enhance 
our strategy in relation to identity and access management 
to optimise the usage of tools, simplify workflows and 
consistently apply key cyber-security concepts 
and capabilities. 

Our focus remains on ensuring our operational technology 
is superior and robust to support Haleon’s business needs 
and to facilitate targeted intervention as necessary. 

We engage leading external organisations to optimise 
our cyber defences and the maturity of our operating 
practices. This includes regular assurance of our cyber 
maturity, independent security and penetration testing 
and crisis management exercises. 

Failure to monitor and respond to the increasing 
geopolitical tensions destabilising key markets can impair 
our ability to deliver our growth and strategic objectives, 
leading to commercial, financial and reputational losses, 
challenging the exchange of products and services, and 
restricting the movement of talent. 

We remain vigilant in monitoring the geopolitical trends 
and how they are likely to impact our business from a 
people, cash flow and access to products perspective. 
Geopolitical risks are considered and managed within 
our continuity planning for both our internal resilience 
and the resilience of our extended supply chain. 

Increased sanctions, other supranational guidelines and 
the imposition of tariffs raise our risk profile and could 
lead to severe trade disruptions, cash flow constraints, 
and restricted opportunities for strategic growth. 

International cooperation remains under pressure, 
including the increasingly complex political relationship 
between China and the US, our two largest markets, 
which may hinder the prospects of current trade deals 
and increase retaliation. 

This risk has increased in 2023 as a result of increasing 
protectionist policies. Looking forward into 2024, it is 
expected to be an important year with many countries 
around the world heading into government elections. 

We assess and depend on the robustness of crisis 
management and business continuity plans which are 
in place for all key markets and sites. Scenario analysis 
is applied in our planning processes to assess potential 
impacts. Our trade compliance and sanctions teams 
monitor upcoming changes in regulation and oversee 
import and export activities. 

We are deeply concerned about ongoing crises in various 
parts of the world. Our response to these situations is led 
by our purpose to deliver better everyday health with 
humanity, putting our employees’ safety, security and 
wellbeing first. We remain focused on ensuring access to 
our essential health products and providing humanitarian 
support, including areas impacted by crises and conflict.

Mass Generative AI

Description and risk development

Outlook

Macroeconomic uncertainty represents challenging 
conditions that affect the economies where we operate. 
For instance, significant increases in energy costs and 
inflationary pressures, including materials, wages and 
transportation costs, may adversely impact consumer 
behaviours and our cost structure. The continuation of 
higher interest rates could result in higher financing 
costs and cash outflows. Changes to fiscal and monetary 
policies may lead to unexpected tax exposures for the 
Group. Fluctuations between trading currencies introduce 
exposure to transactional and translational currency risks. 

AI has the potential to both significantly disrupt the 
industry within which we operate and create opportunities 
to drive competitive advantage. 

Adoption of AI within the business is still at nascent stages 
with regulatory guidelines still evolving. Unclear use of AI 
may cause a misalignment with the organisation’s culture, 
generate unreliable outputs and may also impact 
potential business growth. 

Macroeconomic volatility in key markets remains on the 
horizon for 2024. We remain proactive and vigilant in 
monitoring the financial conditions and assessing the 
potential impact of these scenarios on our business 
model and financial targets. 

AI capabilities and expectations continue to grow rapidly. 
We are actively monitoring the progress in this area 
including changes to the regulatory landscape and 
continue to assess AI’s impact on Haleon and Haleon’s 
AI adoption goals.

Strategic Report

 
 
 
 
Viability statement

Strategic Report

In accordance with Provision 31 of the 
2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Directors have assessed the viability of 
the Group by considering the activities and 
principal risks together with factors likely 
to affect the Group’s future development, 
performance, financial position, cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities, 
as described in the Annual Report. 

The Directors’ assessment of viability has 
been made over a three-year period, which 
corresponds to the Group’s planning cycle. 
Additionally, the Directors believe this 
presents the readers of the Annual Report 
with a reasonable degree of confidence 
over the period assessed. 

The assessment considered the Group’s 
prospects related to revenue, operating 
profit and free cash flow. The Directors 
considered the maturity dates for the 
Group’s debt obligations and its access to 
public and private debt markets, including 
its committed credit facilities. The Directors 
also carried out a robust review and 
analysis of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those risks that could 
materially and adversely affect the Group’s 
business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. 

Stress testing was performed on a number 
of scenarios, including the potential impact 
of severe but plausible scenarios over 
the viability period for each potential 
combination of principal risks identified 
below. In total, four individual scenarios 
have been created incorporating a 

combination of principal risks, with 
a fifth collective scenario, which combines 
all the individual scenarios. Mitigating 
actions for such scenarios include reducing 
A&P spend, reducing capital spend, 
pausing M&A activity and cancelling 
shareholder dividends. 

Based on the assessment described 
above and considering the Group’s current 
financial position, debt maturity profile, 
stable cash generation, access to liquidity, 
geographic diversification and lack of 
concentration of supply, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
is well positioned to manage principal risks 
and potential downside impacts of such 
risks materialising. As a result, the Directors 
expect that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the assessment period. 

Scenario modelled

Key assumptions

Link to principal risks

Scenario 1: A climate event results in a major 
manufacturing site shutdown for 18 months, 
causing disruption to the supply chain 
increasing commodity, freight and labour 
costs and a Group-wide cyber event which 
would cause lost sales for two weeks. 

Scenario 2: No sales price increases or 
volume growth over the forecast period 
across all product categories to reflect slower 
economic growth and competitor activity. 

Scenario 3: Inability to access capital market, 
inflationary pressure, foreign currency 
volatility, interest and tax risks, and 
geopolitical risks. 

Scenario 4: A significant incident that leads 
to a product recall and reputational damage 
for a key brand resulting in nil sale of 
products from this brand for six months. 

 — Decrease in net revenue and gross profit 
as a result of a loss of product sales.

 — Increase in commodity, freight and labour 

costs of other manufacturing sites.

 — Supply chain resilience.
 — Trusted ingredients.
 — Environmental, social and governance.
 — Cyber-security.

 — No price increases and forecasted growth, 
with a corresponding impact on cost of 
goods sold due to lower volumes.

 — Growth model.
 — Geopolitical instability.
 — Macroeconomic uncertainties 

(emerging risk).

 — Failure to further issue commercial paper.
 — Double interest costs on floating rate 

 — Geopolitical instability.
 — Macroeconomic uncertainties 

debt bonds.

(emerging risk).

 — Depreciation of major local currencies 
where the Group generates its profits 
by 5% against pound sterling.

 — No revenue and operating profit generated 
from countries involved in armed conflict 
across the plan period.

 — 75% decrease in sales and operating profit 

for a Power Brand for six months.

 — Significant legal fine (5% of group turnover)
 — Write off all inventories relating to the 
product of the above Power Brand.

 — Additional investment in A&P to rebuild 

the brand.

 — Growth model.
 — Supply chain resilience.
 — Trusted ingredients.

Scenario 5: Combination of all the above 
scenarios together with mitigating actions 
that could reasonably be implemented.

 — Reduced A&P spend, reduced capital spend, 
and cancellation of shareholder dividends.

 — All the above.

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

65

Letter from the Chair

Seeing our regional operations first-hand 
provided insight into major markets and 
R&D initiatives. It also gave Directors a 
chance to meet employees across different 
locations. Employee engagement has 
continued to develop during the year and 
feedback on the Company’s activities is 
regularly discussed by the Board. Further 
detail on our workforce engagement and 
the Workforce Engagement Director’s 
statement is set out on page 70. 

Monitoring our culture, people and 
sustainability ambitions are key areas of 
oversight for the Board. Our discussions 
centred on the cultural transformation 
programme to create a purpose led, 
consumer centric, and performance 
focused culture, which is supported 
by focus on performance, simplification 
and productivity. 

Directors also considered and fulfilled 
duties in relation to Haleon’s governance, 
risk and controls during the year. They 
received training on directors’ duties and, 
in line with all employees, completed 
training on the Code of Conduct, including 
anti-bribery and corruption. Details on 
the Board’s activities for 2023 are 
provided on page 68. 

Embedding the Environmental & 
Social Sustainability Committee
Running a responsible business is one of 
our four strategic pillars, and underpins 
the way we operate. The Environmental 
& Social Sustainability Committee was 
established in March 2023 to provide 
oversight of this important area. The 
Committee had a thorough induction 
process covering Haleon’s responsible 
business strategy and the ESG regulatory 
landscape. The Committee then focused 
on progress against our key environmental 
and health inclusivity goals and 
sustainability strategy. Further information 
is provided on page 77. 

Board succession planning
The Board welcomed Dave Denton as a 
Non-Executive Director in March 2023. 
He replaced John Young as a representative 
director of Pfizer. Dave received a full 
induction following his appointment. 

Talent, capabilities and succession 
planning remains a key area of focus for 
the Board, Executive Team and senior 
management, and our commitment to 
having a diverse and inclusive pipeline of 
talent underpins our efforts to cultivate 
top talent capable of leading the Company 
for the future. Detail on the work of the 
Nominations & Governance Committee 
on this are provided on page 78. 

Board annual performance review 
The Board conducted an internal review 
of its effectiveness for 2023. After 
completing Haleon’s first full year as a 
standalone company, the opportunity 
to review our progress and identify 
any needed changes in approach, was 
particularly important. I was pleased 
with the Board’s engagement with this 
review and that the Directors were 
positive about what had been achieved 
to date, and objective as to the areas 
of focus going forward. You can read 
further details on page 71.

Annual General Meeting (AGM)
Haleon held its first AGM in April 2023. 
We were pleased with the level of 
international participation, and that the 
digital format enabled greater accessibility 
from across our global shareholder base. 

We will be continuing the digital focus for 
our 2024 AGM on 8 May 2024, which will 
be broadcast from our offices in London. 
Details on how to join the meeting will be 
provided in our Notice of Meeting. 

Sir Dave Lewis
Chair

As I shared in my Chair’s statement 
on page 4, this has been a year of 
encouraging progress for Haleon in its 
first full year since listing in July 2022. 

Following the significant work last 
year to enable Haleon to operate as 
a standalone Company, the Board’s 
role in 2023 has been to guide and 
support the management team 
delivering on the Company’s strategic 
and financial plans, and building 
Haleon’s capabilities to drive 
sustainable profitable growth.

Haleon has great potential for growth. 
We have made positive progress in 
2023 and I am pleased with the 
commitment and focus of the Board 
and all Haleon employees to drive 
the Company forward and continue 
to create sustainable value for 
our shareholders. 

Board focus 
The Board held several strategic discussions 
in 2023, including an offsite meeting with 
the Executive Team in October to review 
our long-term category and market 
ambitions, financial targets and investment 
plans. Deep dives provided insights across 
key strategic areas including the consumer 
healthcare landscape, our China and US 
businesses, supply chain, innovation, and 
cyber-security risks. These enhanced the 
Board’s understanding of Haleon’s key 
deliverables, risks and opportunities. 

During the year, the Board visited our Oral 
Health facility in Weybridge, UK and Pain 
Relief center in Richmond, Virginia, US. 
I also had the opportunity to visit Haleon 
operations in Brazil, India, and Mexico.

Section 172 statement

The Board considers that, during 2023, 
it has acted to promote the long-term 
success of the Company for the benefit 
of its members while having due regard 
to the factors set out in Section 172. 

Understanding the needs and expectations 
of the Company’s stakeholders is 
fundamental to Haleon’s purpose: to deliver 
better everyday health with humanity. 

Examples of how Section 172 duties and 
key stakeholders were considered by the 
Board when making key decisions during 
2023 are set out below. 

Divestment of Lamisil and ChapStick
The Board considered the following Section 172 factors: the long-term success of the Company, its relationship with suppliers, 
the need to act fairly between members, and maintaining high standards of business conduct. 

How the Board had regard to these factors:
 — Towards the end of 2022, the Board conducted a strategic portfolio review to identify potential divestment and investment 

opportunities that would support Haleon’s growth ambitions. 

 — The Board considered the brand portfolio segmentation and the optimum timing and priority of divestments to enhance 

organic growth and returns over the longer term. 

 — The Board received updates on the brand portfolio, competitive landscape and customer perspectives throughout 2023.
 — In assessing divestment options, the Board considered the financial impact, marketability, separation issues, speed of execution, 

and simplification of the supply chain. 

 — To enable strategic focus on the Power Brands and Local Growth brands, the Board agreed to divest the Lamisil and ChapStick 

brands.

 — The Board reviewed the offers received for the sale of Lamisil and ChapStick. In accepting each final offer, the Board considered 
the level of return, the financial impact of the divestment on Haleon, impact on employees, the business risks, and the timescale 
for delivery. The Board considered that these divestments would enable Haleon to focus on the key strategic areas for 
longer-term, sustainable growth.

Cultural transformation
The Board considered the following Section 172 factors: employees, business relationships, maintaining high standards of 
business conduct, and the long-term success of the Company. 

How the Board had regard to these factors:
 — The Company has been on a journey of cultural transformation to evolve Haleon’s culture as an independent consumer health business.
 — Employees have been engaged on initiatives to support Haleon in shaping its enterprise culture and to ultimately influence its 

performance and growth and drive behaviours.

 — The Board had a dedicated session on culture to review the feedback from the 2023 employee engagement survey and the 

progress being made towards Haleon’s ambition to be purpose led, consumer centric and performance focused and the key 
areas of focus for management in 2024. 

 — The Board discussed and considered the impact of the Haleon productivity programme as part of Haleon’s cultural evolution.
 — The Board regularly discussed feedback from workforce engagement activities during the year and considered the plan 

for workforce engagement for 2024.

 — The Board encouraged management to keep customers at the heart of any cultural change. This led to an expansion of the cultural 
descriptors to include ‘consumer centric’, recognising the need for a clear link between purpose, culture and brand in a consumer 
health business.

Communication with shareholders
During the year, Directors engaged with 
shareholders and investors through 
face-to-face and virtual meetings to 
discuss progress and performance 
against Haleon’s strategy. 

 — The CEO and CFO conducted fireside 
chats with analysts and investors, as 
well as in-person meetings at a number 
of investor roadshows. 

 — The Chair met with certain major 

institutional shareholders of the Group.

 — The Chair of the Remuneration 

Committee corresponded with major 
institutional shareholders in relation to 
2024 annual and long-term incentives. 

 — Delivered Haleon’s first AGM, with 

participation from retail shareholders.

 — Shareholders’ views were regularly 

discussed by the Board through reports 
from the CEO, CFO and updates from 
the Investor Relations team. 

Board conduct and standards
The Board places a high value in setting 
the right standards of conduct for the 
Company, and creating a culture which 
enables and encourages employees to 
do the right thing. Training on the Code 
of Conduct was completed by all Board 
members, which included anti-bribery 
and corruption.

Workforce engagement

Dame Vivienne Cox
Workforce Engagement Director

During the year, I have enjoyed the 
opportunity to engage with employees 
across different parts of the 
Company, which I have found 
insightful and valuable. 

The sessions have highlighted: 
the positive actions taking place to 
deliver health inclusivity and the 
opportunities to further educate and 
work closely with communities; the 
collaborative team mindset which is 
an enabler to innovation; the need 
to simplify processes and further 
invest in the business to accelerate 
competitive intelligence; and the 
clear support for Haleon’s purpose, 
strategy and culture. 

Looking ahead to 2024, I will be 
seeking to engage on a number 
of topics including brand and 
customers, remuneration, innovation 
and consumer focus, purpose and 
health inclusivity, and work processes 
as an enabler of engagement.

Workforce engagement
In line with Provision 5 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board regularly 
assesses the appropriateness of the 
mechanism for workforce engagement. 
The Board believes that the mechanism 
of a designated Non-Executive Director 
remains the most effective method for 
Haleon to enable the employee voice 
to be heard, and for key insights to be 
brought into the Boardroom.

Employee insight
The Board values the opportunity to 
engage with employees. It is vital to 
understand the issues that are important 
to our employees across Haleon’s markets 
and regions, learn about their experience 
of working at Haleon and be aware of any 
challenges that need to be addressed. 
Alongside providing an insight into the 
Company’s culture, maintaining a pulse on 
employee engagement enables 
understanding of current and future drivers 
of attraction and retention at Haleon. 

Engagement plan
In preparing the workforce engagement 
plan for 2023, the key drivers of engagement 
originated from the 2022 employee 
engagement survey, which identified the 
need to better manage workload, streamline 
processes, improve communication channels 
and provide opportunities for career growth.

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Corporate Governance

During 2023, I met with employees on five 
occasions. It was important to ensure these 
sessions included a cross-business group of 
culturally diverse employees from across 
our key markets and functions. Amongst 
other matters, the sessions explored: 

 — Health inclusivity, which was a 

session with members of various ERGs.

 — Innovation enablement, which was 
a session that took place during the 
Board’s visit to the US, and was joined 
by members of the US R&D team. 
 — Culture, performance and purpose, 
which was joined by Quality Supply 
Chain employees.

 — Work processes, which was conducted 

over two sessions, joined by APAC 
senior managers, and the second 
session joined by EMEA & LatAm 
senior managers.

These sessions offered valuable insight 
into drivers of employee engagement at 
Haleon. The discussions highlighted the 
progress made towards developing a 
caring culture grounded in safety and 
quality, and employee connections to 
Haleon’s purpose and vision. Key points 
raised included further promoting 
employee wellbeing, streamlining 
systems and processes for greater agility, 
continuing to foster local empowerment, 
and unifying culture through change. 

Continued engagement
In addition to my activities, direct 
engagement with employees remains 
extremely valuable, and the Board had 
the opportunity to meet with employees 
during its visits to the Oral Health facility 
in Weybridge, UK and the R&D site in 
Virginia, US. In addition, the Board receives 
regular verbal updates from management, 
which will continue to form a regular part 
of the Board’s agenda for 2024, alongside 
updates on employee survey results, and 
detailed summaries at the end of each 
financial year.

and approach to engagement on page 92.

Board development, effectiveness and performance

Training, development and 
induction
A central piece of Haleon’s culture is a 
commitment to support the continuing 
development of all employees. Directors are 
very supportive of this and are committed 
to their own ongoing professional 
development. The training programmes 
available to the Board are under continual 
review and are updated in line with the 
most pressing developments in both 
Haleon’s governance structure and the 
broader commercial environment. 

During 2023, the Directors participated 
in internal training sessions including 
directors’ duties and disclosure 
obligations, the Code of Conduct and 
anti-bribery and corruption. The Board 
also received briefings on a range of 
strategically important matters to ensure 
they were informed of developments in 
these areas, and were provided with 
regular governance updates on topical 
issues including, changes to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and other 
potential changes in governance and 
sustainability reporting. 

A structured induction programme was 
prepared for David Denton who joined 
the Board on 1 March 2023. This covered, 
amongst other matters, strategy, Group 
structure, directors’ duties, governance, 
key operations, finance, risk and internal 
audit, legal, ESG and HR.

Board effectiveness and evaluation
The Board undertakes an annual evaluation 
process to assess how it, its Committees 
and individual Directors are performing, 
and to highlight areas for improvement or 
evolution. The Board reviewed progress 
against each action from the 2022 Board 

and Committee action plans, and 
determined that progress had been 
made against all actions.

For 2023, the Board adopted a question 
and discussion-based evaluation process 
conducted by the Company Secretary. 
Other regular meeting attendees were 
also requested to provide feedback. 
Findings on the Committees were shared 
with each respective Committee Chair, 
whilst those on the Board as a whole 
were shared with the Nominations & 
Governance Committee, before discussion 
with the wider Board. Action plans for 
the Board and each Committee were 
agreed for 2024, and are detailed in 
the table below. 

Directors’ performance
Evaluation of each Director’s individual 
performance was carried out by the Chair. 
The reviews will be used as the basis for 
recommending the re-election of Directors 
by shareholders at the next AGM. The Chair 
had one-to-one discussions with each 
Director to discuss, amongst other things: 

 — Their performance and individual 

effectiveness. 

 — Their time commitment to Haleon, 
including the potential impact of 
outside interests. 

 — Their ongoing personal development. 
 — The Board’s composition, including 

Non-Executive Director succession plans. 

 — Current and future Committee 
membership and structure.

 — The effective functioning of the Board.

The Chair review process was led by the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director who sought feedback from the 
Non-Executive Directors separately, 

without the Chair present, and also took 
into account the views of the Executive 
Directors. The feedback was collated 
and shared with the Chair. 

Key findings and conclusion
Overall, Directors felt positive about the 
Board and how it functioned, noting the 
step-up in effectiveness during 2023 with 
the completion of the first full annual 
cycle of Board activities and disclosures 
since Haleon’s listing in 2022. The culture 
of the Board was considered to be positive 
with open, direct discussions, good 
engagement and interactions with the 
Executive Team. The Board was felt to 
have a strong mix of experience and 
relevant expertise to support the business. 
Directors noted that Board and Committee 
operations and governance worked well, 
with discussions supported by good 
quality papers and comprehensive 
agendas. Progress had been made in 
relation to strategy and this would 
continue to be an area of focus for 2024. 
Progress had also been made in relation 
to risk, with all key risks appropriately 
prioritised during the year. All Board 
Committees were felt to be well established 
and supported by experienced Chairs. 
The Environmental & Social Sustainability 
Committee had made a good start with 
its remit, developing its understanding 
of the sustainability agenda, data 
and commitments.

Each of the Directors is considered to be 
an effective member of the Board and all 
Directors as at the date of this Report will 
seek re-election at the AGM. 

An externally facilitated Board evaluation 
will be undertaken in 2024.

Audit & Risk Committee Report

Deirdre Mahlan
Chair

Letter from the Chair
During the year, the Committee has 
focused on its core objectives in 
overseeing the integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting process, the 
effectiveness of the external audit 
and the robustness of the Company’s 
control environment to manage risks. 

The Committee has closely monitored 
the Group’s successful first year of 
compliance with Section 404 of the 
US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), as 
well as the effectiveness of the audit 
process as we transitioned to our 
new external auditor, KPMG LLP. 
The Committee has also had a series 
of deep dives into the Group’s 
cyber-security controls and technology 
infrastructure, product user safety and 
trusted ingredients. Further information 
on this and our other activities are set 
out later in this report. 

Changes in regulatory reporting, 
including the recent updates to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and 
the impact to the Group, will be an 
additional area of focus for the 
Committee in 2024.

Key duties and responsibilities
The Committee’s responsibilities include 
monitoring and reviewing:

 — The integrity of financial reporting 

of the Company’s Financial Statements 
including reviewing significant 
judgements and the adequacy 
of related disclosures. 

 — The external and internal audit process 
and performance of the Internal Audit 
function and the external auditor.
 — The effectiveness of the Company’s 

system of internal control.

 — The process for the management 
of related-party transactions. 

 — The Group’s risk management system, 

and the identification and management 
of risks. 

 — The Company’s process for monitoring 
compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements and ethical codes 
of practice.

Membership and meetings
The Committee comprises solely 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. 

Details are set out on pages 62 and 63, 
together with details of their attendance 
for the year on page 67. 

The Chair, CEO, CFO, General Counsel, 
Group Financial Controller, Head of Audit, 
Risk and Assurance, and the lead audit 
partner from KPMG LLP regularly attend 
meetings, with other attendees invited 
as appropriate. The Committee also met 
without management present and met 
privately with the audit partner and with 
the Head of Audit, Risk and Assurance. 

The Board has confirmed that it is satisfied: 

 — That the Committee members 

collectively possess an appropriate 
breadth of recent and relevant financial 
expertise including competence in 
accounting and/or audit and experience 
in the consumer healthcare industry.
 — That Deirdre Mahlan possesses the 

relevant attributes to be the designated 
Audit Committee Financial Expert in 
accordance with US federal securities 
laws and regulations. 

Looking ahead
The Committee will continue to 
focus on its key areas of responsibility, 
including the Group’s financial reporting 
and disclosures, internal control over 
financial reporting, the effectiveness of 
KPMG LLP as external auditor and the 
approach to the 2024 external audit.

In addition, the Committee will consider 
the impact of the recent changes to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code which 
take effect in 2025 and the further 
development of the Group’s enterprise 
risk management framework and 
compliance programmes. Controls 
surrounding the IT environment will 
remain a particular area of focus for the 
Committee as the Group continues to 
embed changes in the IT landscape post 
separation and make improvements in IT 
controls. The Committee will continue to 
review key IT initiatives and related risks 
and progress in the maturity of the control 
environment at each Committee meeting.

Significant reporting matters in relation to the Financial Statements considered by the Committee during 2023

Accounting area

Committee’s conclusion and response

Recoverable 
amount of indefinite 
life brands

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had approximately £18,073m of intangible assets that are indefinite life brands. 
The Group tests at least annually whether indefinite life brands have suffered any impairment. Impairment testing 
is inherently judgemental and requires management to make multiple estimates, including those related to the future 
revenue growth of each brand, terminal growth rates, profit margins, and discount rates. The Committee reviewed 
information on the impairment tests performed, focusing on the critical assumptions as well as any changes from 
the prior year. 

In 2023, the Group recognised non-cash net impairment charges totalling £184 million, principally related to the 
ChapStick brand, as it was determined the carrying value was less than the estimated recoverable amount. The Committee 
noted the decrease in the recoverable amount of the ChapStick brand was mainly driven by the Group’s strategic 
decision to sell the brand below its carrying value. For those brands with limited levels of headroom, the Committee 
also reviewed and challenged sensitivity analyses provided by management to understand the impact of changes 
in key assumptions. The Committee was satisfied with the assumptions utilised by management and also considered 
and reviewed the Group’s relevant impairment disclosures. Refer to Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
on page 136 for further detail. 

Financial and narrative reporting
During the year, the Committee reviewed 
and recommended approval of the 
interim and full-year financial statements, 
and associated releases. In conducting 
its review, the Committee assessed 
key judgement areas, going concern 
and viability statements, and 
impairment reviews. 

The Committee evaluated whether the 
Annual Report, taken as a whole, was 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
contained the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
To support this assessment, management 
established processes to ensure 
consistency of disclosures, address 
financial reporting risks and co-ordinate 
Company-wide input. In fulfilling its role, 
the Committee recommended to the Board 
for approval, a near-final version of the 
Annual Report at its February 2024 
meeting following the Committee’s 
assessment that it was fair, balanced, 
and understandable.

Throughout the year, the Committee 
reviewed key disclosures and reporting 
requirements to ensure clear communication 
of material information to shareholders. 
This included assessing assumptions 
underlying impairment testing, calculating 
gain/loss on disposal of intangible brand 
assets, the going concern and viability 
assessments and climate-related 
financial reporting. 

The Committee received updates on the 
control environment, financial reporting 
integrity, the Annual Report verification 
process, including management’s checklist 
confirming compliance with the relevant 
regulatory requirements, and external 
audit outcomes. The key audit matters 
reviewed by the external auditor and 
the related outcomes are set out in the 
external auditor’s report on pages 99-115. 

The Committee monitors engagements 
with external stakeholders relevant to 
its areas of oversight, including the UK’s 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and the 
US Securities and Exchange Commission.

The FRC carried out a review of Haleon’s 
Annual Report for the year ended  
31 December 2022. No significant 
questions or queries were raised, and 
the Group took into consideration their 
recommendations when preparing this 
Annual Report. The Committee notes that 
the FRC’s review does not provide assurance 
that the Annual Report is correct in all 
material respects as the FRC’s role is not to 
verify information provided, but to consider 
compliance with reporting requirements. 

During the year the Committee also 
reviewed correspondence from the FRC’s 
Audit Quality Review (AQR) team, who 
reviewed Deloitte’s audit of the Group’s 
2022 Financial Statements as part of its 
annual inspection of audit firms. The 
Committee received and reviewed the final 
report from the AQR team which identified 
no key findings or other findings, and 
noted several areas of good practice.

Internal audit 
The Internal Audit function provides 
independent, objective assurance to 
the Board, the Committee and senior 
management on the adequacy and 
effectiveness of Haleon’s risk management, 
governance, and internal control processes. 
The appointment of the Head of Audit, 
Risk and Assurance is a matter reserved 
to the Committee. The Head of Audit, Risk 
and Assurance holds regular discussions 
with the Committee Chair and provides 

regular reports to the Committee on the 
function’s activities. The effectiveness of 
the Internal Audit function, including its 
quality, experience and expertise relative 
to the size of the business, was continually 
monitored through reports received by the 
Committee during the period. These reports 
provided key internal audit observations 
and described proposed improvement 
measures and related time frames given 
to management. 

The Committee approved the annual work 
plan which includes risk-based reviews 
of financial, operational, strategic and 
governance risks, reviews of emerging risks 
and business change activity, together with 
assurance over risk management activities. 
The 2024 Internal Audit plan will be 
regularly reviewed and updated as 
required to reflect evolving assurance 
requirements and priorities.

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Corporate Governance

Corporate Governance

 — Internal controls, discussing 

opportunities to further simplify and 
evolve the framework in line with our 
strategy and operating model. 
 — The crisis and business continuity 

management procedures.

 — Haleon’s concerns management and 
data analysis measuring traction 
and progress.

 — Risk deep dives over principal risks, 
including trusted ingredients, cyber-
security (and IT infrastructure), and 
other enterprise risk areas such as 
treasury, tax and trade compliance.

Based on the Committee’s activities 
performed throughout the year, and 
its annual effectiveness review, the 
Committee considered the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management 
under the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code for the year ended  
31 December 2023 and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report are effective.

Internal control and 
risk management
The Board is responsible for establishing 
procedures to manage risk and oversee 
the Group’s internal control framework 
including setting risk appetite in line with 
the Group’s strategic objectives, and 
ensuring appropriate oversight through 
various mechanisms, including strategy 
meetings, management reports and 
reviews of selected risk areas. 

In 2023, a top-down enterprise risk 
assessment was conducted to review and 
prioritise the Group’s principal risks, assess 
the magnitude of risk exposure, and 
highlight any emerging risks. In parallel, a 
bottom-up risk identification was performed 
across business units, markets, sites and 
functions. The Committee reviewed the 
findings, agreed on the principal risks and 
concluded that management’s approach 
to risk and risk appetite was satisfactory. 

On behalf of the Board, the Committee 
is responsible for reviewing and assessing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems. 

A fundamental part of the work carried out 
included the review of the Group’s principal 
risks and its financial and operational 
controls and procedures. The Committee 
discussed information on risk mitigation 
plans, internal control maturity and areas 
for improvement. 

The Group’s approach to risk management 
and internal controls has further evolved 
and will continue to be refined throughout 
2024. The risk management framework 
is designed to actively manage, rather 
than eliminate, the significant risks 
and uncertainties the Group may face. 
Consequently, the Group’s internal control 
system can only provide reasonable, but 
not absolute, assurance over its 
principal risks.

>>  See also our approach to risk section 

from page 53. 

The Committee reviewed and endorsed 
a range of policies and programmes, 
including: 

 — The Company’s Code of Conduct (Code) 
and its core value of seeking to always 
do the right thing, applicable to the 
Board, Executive Team, employees 
and third-party temporary workers. 
The Code supports and encourages 
good judgement while maintaining 
a culture of risk accountability. 
 — The mandatory anti-bribery and 

corruption (ABAC) training.

 — The annual confirmation process from 
business unit and function general 
managers attesting their governance 
responsibility and the effectiveness 
of the internal control framework, 
including issue response through 
corrective and preventative actions. 

US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) 
The Group is required to comply with the 
provisions of SOX, specifically Sections 
302 and 404, as it relates to an FPI listed 
on a US exchange. During 2023, the 
Group completed a successful first year 
of compliance with Section 404 of SOX. 

The Group’s internal control over financial 
reporting was deemed to be designed 
and operating effectively as at 
31 December 2023. This is a significant 
achievement for the Group and the 
Committee was satisfied with the progress 
in implementing the requirements under 
Section 404 of SOX with respect to 
internal controls over financial reporting.

The Committee will continue to monitor 
the progress of the Group’s internal 
control optimisation efforts, remediation 
of internal control deficiencies, and 
internal controls related to technology 
systems and associated infrastructure.

Audit & Risk Committee Report continued

Cyber-security and 
technology infrastructure
Following the Committee’s review 
of Haleon’s enterprise systems and 
technology infrastructure environment 
in December 2022, certain risk areas were 
identified. During the year, the Committee 
received progress updates on the 
mitigation and remediation plans for these 
risks and was pleased that the remediation 
commitments due for completion in 2023 
were successfully achieved. 

The Committee also received deep dives 
into a number of cyber-security risks 
during the year. The Haleon Information 
Security team commissioned an external 
partner, PwC, to conduct an assessment 
of Haleon as a standalone company 
in the first quarter of 2023 leveraging 
the industry standard framework, 
National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity 
Framework. This assessment provided 
an objective baseline across all assets. 

The findings were discussed with 
the Committee along with a prioritised 
plan which continues to grow cyber-
security maturity for the Company. 
The Committee received and discussed 
a deep dive into some of the risk areas 
and will continue to monitor the 
progress in this area. 

The Committee assessed the effectiveness 
of the external audit process including the 
quality of the audit team and involvement 
by the lead audit partner, the adequacy 
of audit planning, the timely and robust 
execution of the audit, the quality of 
communications to the Committee, and 
auditor independence and objectivity. 
The Committee concluded that the 2023 
external audit was effective, and that the 
external auditor continued to perform 
effectively. Following the Committee’s 
recommendation, the Board recommends 
to shareholders the reappointment of 
KPMG LLP as the external auditor for 2024. 

The total fees paid to KPMG LLP for the 
year ended 31 December 2023 were 
£17.1m, of which £1.2m related to non-
audit work. Details of the fees paid to the 
external auditor are in Note 6 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements on 
page 127.

Non-audit services
The Committee has adopted a policy 
designed to safeguard the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor. 
This policy, which complies with the FRC’s 
2019 Revised Ethical Standard and SOX, 
sets out a framework for determining 
whether it is appropriate to retain the 
external auditor to provide non-audit 
services and outlines the process for 
pre-approving non-audit fees. 

The policy includes a list of permitted 
non-audit services in line with the relevant 
regulations. Any service not on this list 
is prohibited.

External audit
Following an audit tender carried out in 
2022, KPMG LLP was appointed as auditor 
of the Group and engaged in respect of 
the statutory audit of Haleon plc and its 
subsidiaries for the 2023 financial year. 
Nicholas Frost was appointed the lead 
audit partner for the period ended 
31 December 2023. 

During the period, the Committee 
reviewed and discussed the plans for the 
external audit, the proposed audit fees, 
and terms of engagement. It reviewed the 
external audit process and quality and 
experience of the audit partner engaged 
in the audit and also considered the extent 
and nature of the challenge demonstrated 
by the external auditor in their work and 
interactions with management. 

The Committee regularly receives reports 
from the external auditor on the progress 
of its audit activities. The Committee 
reviews the contents of these reports, 
the level of professional judgement and 
challenge of management assumptions 
demonstrated by the external auditor 
and, where appropriate, requests that 
management respond to that challenge 
and tracks management response to 
ensure a satisfactory outcome to the 
challenges raised. 

In considering the independence of 
KPMG LLP, the Committee received 
a statement of independence from the 
external auditor, a report describing 
the arrangements to identify, report 
and manage any conflicts of interest, and 
reviewed the extent of non-audit services 
provided to the Group. The Committee 
confirmed its satisfaction with the 
effectiveness and independence of KPMG 
LLP with respect to their engagements in 
their respective jurisdictions.

The Committee has pre-approved the 
use of the external auditor for non-audit 
services where:

 — They are included in the policy’s list 
of permitted non-audit services; and 

 — They are approved by the Group 

Financial Controller, or their designate 
in certain defined circumstances, when 
not exceeding £100,000; or 

 — They are approved by the CFO and the 
Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee 
when they exceed £100,000.

The total fee for non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor is 
reported to the Audit & Risk Committee 
on a quarterly basis. Management’s 
approval based on monetary limits is 
not a delegation of authority for approval 
by the Audit & Risk Committee, but rather 
a confirmation of adherence to the policy 
for permissible non-audit services. 
The Committee reviews the nature and 
level of non-audit services undertaken 
by the external auditor during the year 
to satisfy itself that there is no impact 
on its independence. 

During the period ended 31 December 2023, 
the external auditor undertook non-audit 
work in relation to other assurance 
services, corporate finance and other 
services and was paid a total of £1.2m.

The Committee considers for the year 
ended 31 December 2023, that the 
Company has complied with the 
Competition and Markets Authority’s 
Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 and the 
FRC’s Audit Committees and the 
External Audit: Minimum Standard.

Marie-Anne Aymerich
Chair

Letter from the Chair
The Committee was established in 
March 2023 and has since started 
to lay down some good foundations. 
We held an extensive education 
session covering Haleon’s responsible 
business strategy, its goals and the 
external ESG landscape. In addition, 
the Committee held two formal 
meetings during the rest of the year. 

During those meetings we spent 
significant time considering 
Haleon’s sustainability disclosures, 
the vast regulatory and reporting 
requirements in this area, and 
received comprehensive deep dives 
on areas within the Committee’s 
remit including packaging and 
health inclusivity. 

The Committee has covered much 
ground since March, but there is more 
to do in 2024 to support the delivery 
of Haleon’s sustainability ambitions 
and disclosure obligations. 

Key duties and responsibilities
The Committee’s responsibilities for 
environmental and social sustainability 
(ESS) include monitoring and reviewing:

 — Haleon’s progress against its ESS agenda 
and associated external governance 
and regulatory requirements. 

 — Emerging ESS issues that could impact 
the Group’s operations, ESS initiatives, 
or reputation.

 — Haleon’s ESS engagement with 
relevant external stakeholders, 
NGOs and other interested parties. 

 — The ESS disclosures within the 

Annual Report and external ESS 
reporting, including the Climate 
Action Transition Plan. 

Membership and meetings
The Committee comprises solely 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. 

Details are set out on pages 62 and 63, 
together with details of attendance for 
the year on page 67. The Chair, CEO,  
Head of Transformation and Sustainability, 
VP Sustainability, and the Sustainability 
Programme Director regularly attended 
meetings in 2023. Other attendees were 
invited to meetings as appropriate.

Committee induction
Following the establishment of the 
Committee, an induction session was 
held with input from external experts.  
The session covered Haleon’s responsible 
business strategy, environmental and 
social sustainability, the external 

environment and mandatory reporting, 
regulations and disclosures relevant to the 
Committee’s remit. This helped to shape 
the Committee’s agenda for the rest of 
2023, with particular focus on Haleon’s 
health inclusivity strategy, sustainable 
packaging, and external reporting.

Key metrics and future reporting
As part of the deep dive sessions, the 
Committee reviewed the scope and ambition 
of the Company’s health inclusivity and 
packaging targets. The Committee 
reviewed the threshold level of impact 
required for the Company to measure 
achievement against Haleon’s social 
impact goal, and considered how to 
balance the breadth of reach of the 
initiatives versus the depth of impact. 
The Committee also approved an update 
to Haleon’s baseline year for our Scope 3 
carbon emissions and virgin petroleum-
based plastic reduction targets.

In addition to Haleon’s current ESS 
ambitions, the Committee considered 
Haleon’s future external ESG disclosure 
requirements, including how to most 
effectively and efficiently balance 
reporting requirements from different 
jurisdictions as a global business.

Looking ahead
The Committee will continue to focus 
on oversight in relation to packaging, 
carbon net zero, health inclusivity and 
progress against the Company’s 
sustainability ambitions.

Committee Report

Sir Dave Lewis
Chair

Letter from the Chair 
This year the Committee focused on 
succession planning for the Executive 
Team, given there has been a number 
of changes. The Committee also had 
sessions on talent and succession 
within the wider organisation and 
received insight into the broader 
talent agenda for senior management. 

Discussions during the year also 
focused on progress against the 
Board’s Diversity & Inclusion Policy, 
diversity at the top two management 
levels of the Group and progress 
against our responsible 
business ambitions. 

In addition, we continued to regularly 
consider the composition of the 
Board and discussed Non-Executive 
Director succession. 

The Committee will continue to focus 
on its key areas of responsibility with 
a particular emphasis on developing 
a strong and diverse talent pipeline 
at the Board and senior 
management level. 

Committee activities

Succession planning

Key duties and responsibilities
The Committee’s responsibilities include:

 — Leading the process for appointments 

to the Board.

 — Ensuring plans are in place for orderly 

succession to both the Board and senior 
leadership positions.

 — Overseeing the development of 

a diverse pipeline for succession at 
Board and senior management level.

 — Reviewing and recommending the 
Board Diversity & Inclusion Policy. 
 — Monitoring and, where appropriate, 

recommending changes to the 
Company’s corporate governance 
framework.

Membership and meetings
Excluding the Chair, who was considered 
independent on appointment, the 
Committee comprises solely Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. 

Details are set out on pages 62 and 63, 
together with details of attendance for 
the year on page 67. The CEO and the  
Chief Human Resources Officer regularly 
attended meetings, with other attendees 
invited as appropriate. 

Sucession planning
The Committee continued to build on its 
existing processes to strengthen its focus 
on succession planning. During 2023, 
it assessed the composition of the Board 
in terms of the balance of Executive 
and Non-Executive roles, and its skills, 
experience, diversity, capacity and tenure. 

The Committee also discussed the 
Company’s leadership requirements 
including assessing the Executive Team’s 
capabilities and development plans 
against the current and future succession 
needs. In addition, it reviewed the people 
strategy and talent agenda more broadly 
to help in developing a pipeline of 
potential future leaders. 

With the exception of David Denton 
who was appointed on 1 March 2023, the 
Directors were all newly appointed in July 
2022 and the Committee considers that 
the Board’s membership and composition 
remains appropriate.

Composition, time commitment 
and independence
Further to the disclosure on page 71, 
the Committee assessed the composition 
and effectiveness of the Board and its 
Committees. This included reviewing the 

 — Considered Non-Executive Director’s tenure and succession planning arrangements for the 

Board including the CEO and CFO.

 —  Recommended to the Board each Director stand for re-election by shareholders at the 

Governance

Company’s 2023 AGM. 

 —  Reviewed and made recommendations to the Board in respect of each Director’s actual, 

potential or perceived conflicts of interest.

balance of skills, experience, and diversity 
represented. It also assessed each 
Non-Executive Director’s time commitment 
and reported the outcomes of this activity 
to the Board. The assessment considered 
internal responsibilities and the number 
and nature of the Directors’ external 
commitments. All Non-Executive Directors 
demonstrated they have sufficient time 
to devote to their present role. 

Board diversity, equity and inclusion
The Board and its Committees have a 
diverse mix of gender, socio-economic 
and ethnic backgrounds, knowledge, 
personal attributes, skills and experience. 
While all Director appointments are based 
on merit, each candidate is assessed 
against objective criteria, with the prime 
objective to maintain and enhance the 
Board’s overall effectiveness.

The Senior Independent Director (SID) 
reviewed the time commitment of the 
Chair as part of his annual review of the 
Chair’s performance. In line with Provision 
11 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
over half of our Board members are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Bryan Supran and David Denton are not 
considered independent as they are 
nominees of Pfizer. 

The Committee monitors progress against 
the Board and its Committees’ diversity 
objectives which are set out in the Board 
Diversity & Inclusion Policy (the Policy), as 
part of its Board and Committee succession 
planning and, in addition to the skills and 
experience matrix, has regular regard to 
external guidance on improving diversity. 
As a result of this, the Board updated the 
Policy during 2023, to reflect evolving best 
practice and regulation. 

A copy of the Policy can be found on our 
website, as outlined below. 

As at 15 March 2024, the Company met 
the recommendations of the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review on gender diversity, and 
the Parker Review objective on board 
ethnic minority representation. The Board 
met and exceeded the FCA Listing Rules 
requirements in respect of female 
representation and ethnic diversity, as set 
out in the table below. While no women 
currently serve as Chair, SID, CEO or CFO 
as required by the Listing Rules, three 
out of the four Board Committee Chairs, 
as well as the Workforce Engagement 
Director, are appointments currently 
held by women. As part of our succession 
planning and as appointments to the 
Board are considered, we will be mindful 
of the Listing Rules requirements.

Directors’ Remuneration Report

Tracy Clarke
Chair

Letter from the Chair
I am delighted to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for Haleon plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2023. 

Our first Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy received strong shareholder 
support and was approved by 98.2% 
of shareholders at the 2023 AGM. 
The first Directors’ Remuneration 
Report received 98.7% support 
from our shareholders. Both the 
Remuneration Policy and its 
implementation in 2023 were 
designed to reward performance 
that delivers, at a minimum, Haleon’s 
investment case and drive growth, 
and it was therefore pleasing that 
shareholders have endorsed this 
approach. The Committee remains 
confident that the remuneration 
structure in place supports a 
management team that is committed 
to delivering consistently strong 
performance, while creating a 
sustainable, values and purpose-led 
Company. I would like to thank the 
shareholders that engaged with me 
and provided helpful feedback as 
the Committee designed, refined and 
finalised the remuneration structure.

Tracy Clarke 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
15 March 2024

Rewarding 2023 performance
2023 was a year of strong financial 
performance against a set of stretching 
targets. Organic revenue growth was 
achieved at 8.0% and adjusted operating 
profit growth was achieved at 10.4%. 
However, as these targets were set in a 
high inflation environment, when reviewing 
these outcomes the Committee carefully 
considered the impact of inflation 
experienced in several markets in the 
context of wider business performance 
in 2023. On this basis, the Committee 
considered it appropriate to apply 
discretion to the 2023 annual incentive plan 
(AIP) outcome which resulted in a reduction 
of c.10 ppts compared to the formulaic 
result. The overall outcome under the 2023 
AIP was therefore 75.2% of the maximum 
opportunity for the CEO and 77.7% of 
maximum opportunity for the CFO. 
The Haleon PSP Refill awards granted 
in March 2023 vested in March 2024, by 
reference to the performance period ended 
on 31 December 2023. These awards vested 
at 81% of maximum, based on performance 
against the Cumulative free cash flow and 
net debt/adjusted EBITDA targets. The full 
details of the 2023 remuneration paid to 
Directors and the basis for its determination 
are set out on pages 84-88.

2024 remuneration structure
There have been no changes to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved 
by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. 

For 2024, the AIP performance measures 
remain (subject to aligning names and 
definitions of measures to the Company’s 
financial KPIs) Organic revenue growth 
(60% weighting), Organic operating profit 
growth (20% weighting) and individual 
business objectives (IBOs) (20% weighting). 
Following review and due consideration, 
the Committee concluded that the balance 
of measures remains in line with the 
investment case for Haleon, in particular 
the weighting towards organic revenue 
growth, and so no changes were made 
to the AIP structure for 2024.

The 2023 PSP performance measures 
included cumulative free cash flow (50%), 
net debt/adjusted EBITDA (50%) and ESG 
qualifier thresholds on carbon reduction, 
recycle-ready packaging and gender 

diversity in leadership roles. As the 
business is getting closer to reaching its 
initial deleveraging target (below 3.0x 
net debt/adjusted EBITDA), to ensure 
that the performance measures continue 
to support the most critical strategic 
objectives, for the 2024-2026 performance 
cycle the net debt/adjusted EBITDA 
measure (50% weighting) will be replaced 
with a combination of two alternative 
measures, adjusted diluted earnings per 
share growth (EPS) (30% weighting) and 
organic operating margin improvement 
(operating margin) (20% weighting).

EPS will drive a focus on bottom-line 
performance, whilst operating margin will 
enhance the focus on profitable growth, 
both of which are critical to driving 
long-term shareholder value. The addition 
of EPS and operating margin improvement 
will rebalance the incentive structure 
towards a focus on profitability, highlighting 
the importance of achieving margin 
improvement alongside top-line growth. 
Despite this change in the 2024-2026 
metrics, our strategy remains consistent. 

The 50% weighting on cumulative free 
cash flow will remain for 2024 as it 
continues to be a strategic priority to 
drive financial discipline. The generation 
of stable cash flow is a critical part of 
how value is created for our shareholders, 
including our ability to deliver returns. 

In addition, as the external commitment 
on recycle-ready packaging runs to 2025, 
this threshold will be replaced by a 
metric assessing the reduction in virgin 
petroleum-based packaging as part of 
the ESG qualifier for the 2024-2026 cycle. 
This metric is aligned with Haleon’s 
external commitment to reduce use of 
virgin petroleum-based plastic, with the 
threshold taking into account the change 
in the baseline from 2020 to 2022, as set 
out on page 22.

In combination across the 2024 AIP and 
PSP, the financial measures have been 
chosen to align our Executive Directors’ 
remuneration with our strategy to deliver 
sustainable above-market growth and 
attractive returns, while running a 
responsible business, which is integral 
to all that we do.

targets linked to incentive awards is provided 
on pages 85-89.

Having considered all relevant factors, 
including workforce remuneration 
arrangements, inflation rates and market 
practice, the Committee approved a 4.5% 
salary increase for the Executive Directors 
and a 4.5% fee increase for the Chair, the 
first pay increase awarded to the Executive 
Directors and the Chair since the demerger 

in July 2022. This is in line with the average 
4.5% increase awarded to UK employees. 
The base fees for Non-Executive Directors 
will also increase by 4.5%. 

Shareholder engagement
In December 2023, I wrote to our largest 
shareholders regarding the changes we 
are making to the 2024 PSP performance 
measures and other aspects of the 
implementation of our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in 2024. 

I am very grateful for the support and 
valuable comments that we have received. 
The Committee will continue to ensure that 
the performance measures support our 
strategy, including the delivery of 
attractive returns.

I remain available for any shareholders 
who wish to discuss our policy, or any of 
the content set out in this report, ahead 
of the 2024 AGM.

Key duties and responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee’s principal 
responsibilities are:

 — Making recommendations to the Board 
on remuneration principles and policy

practices that support the Company’s 
strategy and promote its long-term 
sustainable success. 

 — Ensuring that performance conditions 

are transparent, stretching and 
rigorously applied.

outcomes and recovery and withholding 
of awards where the Committee deems 
this to be appropriate.

 — Making recommendations to the Board 
concerning the introduction of new 
share incentive plans which require 
Board or shareholder approval.

 — Reviewing employee remuneration and 
key related policies, and the alignment 
of incentives and rewards, with the 
Company’s culture and taking these 
into account when determining the 
policy for executive remuneration.

Membership and meetings
The Committee comprises solely 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. 

Details are set out on page 62 and 63,

Head of Reward and a representative from 
the independent remuneration adviser 
(PwC) attend meetings on a regular basis. 
Other attendees are invited to meetings 
as appropriate. The Committee also meets

remuneration is discussed and they are 
not involved in determining their 
own remuneration.

1  Organic revenue growth was referred to as ‘organic sales growth’ in the 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report. This measure has not changed, however, the name has been aligned with 

the strategic KPI for ease of reference.

Malus and clawback
The Committee may apply malus and clawback at any time prior to the second anniversary of the date the cash element of an annual 
bonus is paid, or a share award vests. The Committee may only invoke these malus and clawback provisions in accordance with the Haleon 
malus and clawback policy from time to time, in circumstances such as a material misstatement of results; a failure of risk management 
resulting in material financial loss; an error or material misstatement which results in an overpayment (such as in the assessment of 
performance); a corporate failure of the Company; employee misconduct; or material reputational damage to the Company.

In addition, on 1 December 2023, the Company adopted a mandatory clawback policy that complies with the SEC requirements 
introduced during the year.

What performance means for Executive Directors’ pay in 2023
At Haleon, remuneration packages are designed to ensure strong alignment between pay and performance. 2023 saw the Company 
perform strongly against its financial and strategic objectives which has been appropriately reflected in the incentive outcomes, as set 
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration from page 84.

2023 AIP outcome
Following a year of strong performance, the formulaic AIP 
outcomes were 85.1% of maximum (CEO) and 87.6% of maximum 
(CFO). However, in line with the Committee’s discretion, the 
outcome was reduced by c.10 ppts to reflect higher than 
expected inflation experienced in several markets.

2023 PSP Refill awards
The PSP Refill awards vested at 81% of maximum, in line with 
performance against the cumulative free cash flow and net debt/
adjusted EBITDA targets, combined with considerable progress 
on responsible business objectives.

1  The value of the 2023 AIP includes both the cash (50% of the AIP) and deferred portion (50% of the AIP). The deferred part of the bonus is subject to malus and clawback in 

accordance with the malus and clawback policies, but no further performance conditions.

2  2023 PSP vesting shows the PSP Refill awards which vested in March 2024. The value of awards has been calculated based on the average share and ADS price over the last three 
months of 2023 (£3.2887/$8.2421) and includes the accumulated dividends delivered in the form of shares. The actual value of vesting PSP Refill awards, based on the share price 
on the vesting date could not be calculated prior to the publication of this Report and therefore will be shown in the 2024 Report. Due to the share price appreciation over the vesting 
period, the estimated value per share of the 2023 PSP Refill awards is higher than the value per share at grant by $50,156 (£40,448) for Brian McNamara and by £2,900 for Tobias 
Hestler. The value of the 2023 PSP Refill award for Brian McNamara has been converted to GBP using the average 2023 exchange rate of 1.24. There were no Haleon PSP awards 
vesting in 2022.

3  2022 remuneration is shown for the period between Directors’ appointment (23 May 2022) and the end of the financial year (31 December 2022).
4  Pre-demerger remuneration for Brian McNamara was set in US Dollars and has been converted to GBP in the table above, using the average 2022 exchange rate of 1.24.
5  The value of 2022 benefits for Brian McNamara has been restated to show the actual cost of tax equalisation arrangements provided in line with the GSK plc policy, as set out in the 

2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report. The total reduction in this value was £55,780. 

6  Each remuneration element is rounded to the nearest £1,000, and totals reflect the sum of these rounded values.

2024 salaries
The Committee carefully considered whether any increases should be awarded to Executive Directors’ salaries in 2024. Factors that 
have been taken into account when considering Directors’ pay included investors’ expectations, external environment, Company 
performance, planned salary increases for the wider employee population, personal performance of the executives and competitive 
market positioning of the total remuneration packages against the main peer groups. In 2023 these peer groups included constituents 
of the FTSE 30 (excluding financial services) and a bespoke group of large international FMCG companies1. The Committee noted that 
Executive Directors’ salaries had not been reviewed since the demerger. Based on the considerations set out above, the Committee 
approved a 2024 salary increase of 4.5% for the Executive Directors, in line with the average increase which will be awarded to the 
wider UK workforce.

2023 Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) awards (audited)
The 2023 AIP awards were based on performance for the year ended 31 December 2023. 80% of the bonus opportunity is determined 
by financial performance and 20% is based upon the achievement of IBOs. 

The figures below represent the total 2023 AIP awards to be paid, including the portion payable in cash in 2024, and the portion 
deferred into shares for a further three years to be released in 2027, subject to continued employment and malus and clawback 
provisions. In line with the Policy, deferral provisions apply to 50% of the 2023 AIP value.

2023 was a year of strong financial performance. The 2023 AIP was subject to a set of ambitious targets which were defined at the 
beginning of the year, in line with our stretching business plan. The outcomes were at the upper end of the improved guidance 
provided by the Company at Half Year. Organic revenue growth was achieved at 8.0%, and adjusted operating profit growth was 
achieved at 10.4% (this compares to the reported organic operating profit growth of 10.8% for 2023; from 2024, the AIP measure 
will be aligned with the organic operating profit growth). 

Given that targets were set in a high inflation environment, the Committee considered whether the incentive outcome fairly reflects 
the underlying business performance. This analysis included determining the level of impact of higher-than-expected inflation 
experienced in several markets on the outcome of the 2023 AIP. 

Having discussed this impact, the Committee considered it appropriate to apply discretion to the 2023 AIP outcome which resulted 
in a reduction to the organic sales growth outcome from 8.0% to 6.8% and the adjusted operating profit from 10.4% to 9.2% to reflect 
the high inflationary impact. This has reduced the outcome of the 2023 AIP for the Executive Directors by c. 10 percentage points, 
from 85.1% of maximum for the CEO and 87.6% of maximum for the CFO to 75.2% of maximum for the CEO and 77.7% of maximum 
for the CFO respectively.

Achievement of 2023 Individual Business Objectives (IBOs) (audited)
20% of the Executive Directors’ 2023 AIP is linked to the achievement of IBOs which were focused on key strategic objectives. 
In addition to the objectives outlined in the bonus, there is an expectation that the Executive Directors will each demonstrate the 
required high leadership standards and behaviours of the Company.

At the end of the year, the Committee considered the performance of each Executive Director against pre-set objectives. At its meeting 
in February 2024, it concluded that 2023 had seen progress in the achievement of our strategic objectives, as described in the Strategic 
Report. This has been reflected in the assessment of the Executive Directors’ 2023 IBOs, showing their contribution to the execution of 
Group strategy during 2023. IBOs are calibrated with a high degree of stretch in them such that outcomes above target are only achieved 
for exceptional performance over the performance period.

The table below summarises performance against the key 2023 IBOs for the current Executive Directors:

Performance Share Plan Refill awards vesting (audited)
As set out in our 2022 Report, ‘Refill’ share awards were granted to the Executive Directors (as well as other former GSK employees) in 
respect of the lapsed portion of GSK share awards that were time pro-rated at demerger. PSP Refill awards were granted on 23 March 
2023 and vested on 1 March 2024. The performance measures for the PSP Refill awards were aligned with the measures for the annual 
2022 PSP awards, being cumulative free cash flow (50%) and net debt/adjusted EBITDA (50%). The targets were aligned with those 
used for the 2022 award and were calibrated to reflect the shorter performance period.

An ESG qualifier is also included within the 2023 PSP design, to reflect commitments that the Company has made on carbon reduction, 
recycle-ready packaging and gender diversity. 

In designing the ESG qualifier, the Committee has set thresholds for each of the three measures and, at the end of the performance 
period, if any of the thresholds are missed, a reduction in the level of vesting of 10% could be applied for each missed threshold. 
In addition, if the metrics are static or go backwards compared to the 2022 baseline, a 25% reduction in the level of vesting could 
be applied for each measure (i.e., a potential overall reduction of up to 75%).

The ESG qualifier thresholds for the 2023 PSP are as follows:

Measure

Threshold

Carbon reduction 
(Measured for 12 months to November 2025)

Recycle-ready packaging 
(Measured for 12 months to June 2025)

Diversity 
(Quarterly average in 2025)

At least 48% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions from the 2020 level.

At least 80% of packaging should be recycle-ready.

At least 45% of leadership roles should be held by women.

In determining the vesting levels and any adjustment which should apply, the Committee will also consider wider factors, including 
whether broader plans to meet Haleon’s responsible business commitments are on track.

Performance Share Plan awards to be made in 2024
Brian McNamara and Tobias Hestler will be granted awards with a face value of 450% of salary and 350% of salary respectively.

Performance measures for the 2024 PSP awards
The 2023 PSP performance measures included cumulative free cash flow (50%), net debt/adjusted EBITDA (50%) and the ESG 
qualifier threshold on carbon reduction, recycle-ready packaging and gender diversity in leadership roles. As the business is getting 
closer to reaching its initial deleveraging target (below 3.0x net debt/adjusted EBITDA), to ensure that the performance measures 
continue to support the most critical strategic objectives, for the 2024-2026 performance cycle the net debt/adjusted EBITDA measure 
(50% weighting) will be replaced with a combination of two alternative measures, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth (EPS) 
(30% weighting) and organic operating margin improvement (operating margin) (20% weighting). This change in financial metrics does 
not signal a change in strategy, which remains consistent.

EPS will be aligned with the headline adjusted diluted EPS metric disclosed in the Annual Report and will be measured as compound 
growth over the performance period at constant currency (i.e., cumulative growth calculated each year on an organic basis, at constant 
currency and removing the impact of acquisitions and divestments). It is expected that one-off events, such as M&A, which were not 
anticipated at the time of target setting, will be excluded from the calculation in the year when the event occurred. In addition, the 
impact of any share buybacks will be considered by the Remuneration Committee on a case-by-case basis. 

Operating margin targets will be expressed as a cumulative basis points (bps) improvement and measured at constant currency. 
This measure is derived from organic revenue growth and organic profit growth and as such, excludes the impact of acquisitions, 
divestments, closures of brands, and the impact of translational currency exchange movements. It will be based on margin improvement 
over the performance period (i.e., cumulative improvement calculated each year on an organic basis).

The 50% weighting on cumulative free cash flow will remain for 2024 as it continues as a strategic priority to drive financial discipline. 
The generation of stable cash flow is a critical part of how value is created for our shareholders, including our ability to deliver returns.

The Committee reviews the mix of measures in incentives on an annual basis and will continue to consider whether the performance 
measures remain aligned with our strategic priorities.

An ESG qualifier is also included within the 2024 PSP design, to reflect commitments that the Company has made on carbon reduction, 
the use of plastic and gender diversity. The operation of the qualifier is unchanged from 2023, such that at the end of the performance 
period, if any of the thresholds are missed, a reduction in the level of vesting of 10% could be applied for each missed threshold. 
In addition, if the metrics are static or go backwards compared to the 2023 baseline, a 25% reduction in the level of vesting could 
be applied for each measure (i.e., a potential overall reduction of up to 75%).

The carbon reduction and gender diversity ESG thresholds were retained in the 2024-2026 measures. The external commitment on 
recycle-ready packaging runs to 2025, and therefore this metric will be replaced by a metric assessing the reduction in virgin petroleum-
based packaging as part of the ESG qualifier for the 2024-2026 cycle, in line with Haleon’s commitment to reduce the use of virgin 
petroleum-based plastic. The threshold was set taking into account the change in the baseline year from 2020 to 2022, as the 2022 
data used to calculate our packaging footprint has greater availability and accuracy. More detail can be found on page 22. 

The ESG qualifier thresholds for the 2024 PSP are as follows:

Measure

Threshold

Carbon reduction 
(Measured for 12 months to November 2026)

Reduction in virgin petroleum-based packaging 
(Measured for 12 months to June 2026)

Diversity

At least 55% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions from the 2020 level.

At least 12% reduction from the 2022 level.

At least 46% of leadership roles should be held by women.

In determining the vesting levels and any adjustment which should apply, the Committee will also consider wider factors, including 
whether broader plans to meet Haleon’s responsible business commitments are on track.

Principles addressed when determining the remuneration outcomes for Executive Directors
When determining the remuneration outcomes, the Committee had regard to a number of key principles: clarity and simplicity of the 
incentive structure (remuneration aligned with market practice, consisting of a single short-term incentive and long-term incentive), 
avoiding payment for failure (a range of design features take into account risk, including malus and clawback provisions), proportionality 
(rewarding performance against stretching targets), and acting in line with our purpose and culture when setting remuneration. The full 
description of how our Policy aligns with these principles is set out on page 86 of the 2022 Annual Report, available on the website at 
www.haleon.com. 

In addition, when determining incentive outcomes, the Committee may use its discretion to ensure that a fair and balanced outcome 
is achieved, taking into account the overall performance of the Company, including all relevant external factors and the experience of 
shareholders. Any use of discretion would be explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and may, as appropriate, be the subject 
of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.

Payments for loss of office and to past Directors (audited)
There were no payments to Directors for loss of office and no payments to past Directors during 2023.

Total shareholder return (TSR)
The chart shows the monthly value, from the time of demerger to 31 December 2023, of a notional sum of £100 invested in Haleon 
shares on 18 July 2022, compared to £100 invested in the FTSE 100 on the same date. The FTSE 100 Index was chosen as the 
comparator because the Company is a constituent of this index. To provide shareholders with additional context, the chart also shows 
a bespoke group of large international FMCG companies used for remuneration benchmarking: Diageo, AstraZeneca, GSK, British 
American Tobacco, Vodafone Group, Imperial Brands, Danone S.A., Heineken N.V., Burberry Group, Associated British Foods, L’Oréal

Methodology
In line with the approach taken in 2022, we have chosen to use Option B as our preferred methodology to calculate the CEO pay ratio. 
Given the complexity of the pay arrangements for different categories of UK employees at Haleon, this approach allows us to leverage 
the existing gender pay gap calculations and thus presents a practical and efficient approach, using robust and meaningful data that 
is representative of the remuneration levels for UK employees. 

The Company used data from the 2023 gender pay gap calculation to determine employees positioned at each pay quartile and 
excluded those employees who left the Company before 31 December 2023. Remuneration was calculated in line with the methodology 
used to determine the single total figure of remuneration for the CEO, as presented in this Report. Remuneration figures are determined 
with reference to the financial year ending on 31 December 2023. The remuneration covers salary, benefits and pension contributions, 
bonus in respect of 2023 which will be paid in March 2024 and share awards without performance conditions granted in 2023. 
No components were omitted from the calculation and no adjustments were made to any of the pay elements. Where required, actual 
remuneration was converted into a full-time equivalent by pro-rating earnings to reflect full-time contractual working hours. 

The Committee determined that the identified employees are reasonably representative of the pay quartiles, since the structure of 
their remuneration arrangements is in line with that of the majority of employees in the UK. The Committee believes that the median 
pay ratio for the 2023 financial year is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for the Company’s UK employees. 

The change in the CEO pay ratio from the prior year is primarily attributed to the vesting of the Haleon PSP Refill awards for the CEO 
whereas the 2022 single figure of remuneration did not include any long-term incentive awards.

1  Change in salary/fees for Directors is shown as the change from the post-demerger annual rate of salary applicable for 2022 to the rate applicable for 2023.
2  Change in benefits for Directors is shown as annualised value of post-demerger benefits for 2022 compared with the full value of benefits in 2023.
3  Change in bonus for the Executive Directors is shown as the annualised value of the post-demerger 2022 AIP compared with the full value of the 2023 AIP.
4  David Denton and Bryan Supran do not receive Non-Executive Director fees. David Denton joined the Board with effect from 1 March 2023.
5  John Young stepped down from the Board with effect from 28 February 2023. 
6  Only a very small number of individuals are employed by the same entity as Directors. As the number of employees is fewer than five, data for this entity is not presented. 

Therefore the table above shows a comparison to the average remuneration for all UK employees of Haleon. 

7  Average change in salary for the UK employees is the average increase awarded to the UK workforce in 2023. Average change in benefits for the UK employees represents a change 
in the medical benefit offering in the UK between 2022 and 2023 which resulted in an increase in the average monthly premium. Average change in bonus for the UK employees is 
calculated as the change in the business multiplier between 2022 and 2023 and will be re-stated in the 2024 report when actual bonus data is available.

Consideration of workforce pay and approach to engagement
The Board receives regular updates on employee engagement, including employee engagement survey results, with a detailed update 
presented annually. In addition, workforce engagement is covered on page 70, which includes commentary on how the views of 
employees were considered by the Board. 

To ensure that the remuneration-related decisions are fair and appropriate, the Committee considered employees’ pay increases 
when determining the appropriate salary levels for the Executive Directors and fees for the Chair. In addition, the Committee was 
provided with an update on bonus outcomes for the wider employee population, which were taken into account to ensure that the 
bonus outcomes appropriately reflect business performance at all levels in the organisation. Furthermore, the Committee approved 
the implementation of Haleon’s all-employee share plans and agreed the terms and details of the 2023 and 2024 share awards made 
to the executives and other senior employees. In 2023, the Workforce Engagement Director, Dame Vivienne Cox, conducted a series 
of meetings with various groups of employees across multiple geographies and functions. She covered the role of the Board and the 
Committee in one of her sessions, setting out how the Remuneration Committee operates and how it considers wider workforce 
remuneration arrangements. 

In addition, employees have been informed about the alignment between the executive remuneration structure and the wider 
workforce remuneration arrangements as part of the wider reward communications. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which 
is available on Haleon’s website, has been shared with employees, providing an opportunity to view and assess the remuneration 
structure which applies to the Board. The Company always welcomes employee feedback, and views on executive remuneration 
will be shared with the Committee.

Remuneration Committee advisers
During 2023, PwC was the independent remuneration adviser to the Committee. PwC was appointed by the Committee in August 2022. 
As part of this process, the Committee considered the services that PwC provided to other FTSE 100 companies and Haleon’s 
competitors, as well as other potential conflicts of interest. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and voluntarily 
operates under their code of conduct when providing advice on executive remuneration in the UK. PwC regularly meets with the 
Chair of the Committee without management present. The Committee is comfortable that the PwC engagement partner and team 
providing remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with Haleon or its individual Directors that may impair their 
independence and objectivity. The total fees paid to PwC for the provision of independent advice to the Committee in 2023 were 
£74,500 charged on a fixed fee as well as time and materials basis. During 2023, PwC also provided other services to Haleon entities, 
including tax advice, internal audit and assurance, controls (e.g., SOX, organisational controls and cyber-security assessments), general 
management consultancy, advice relating to Group-wide projects, staff augmentation for cyber-security specific requirement, short 
and medium secondees, deals and transactions work. Remuneration advice is provided by an entirely separate team within PwC.

Statement of voting at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the 2022 Directors’ Remuneration Report were approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM.

endorsement by our shareholders. The votes received were:

Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment
Brian McNamara’s and Tobias Hestler’s service contracts, dated 9 May 2022 and 10 May 2022 respectively, are subject to a 12-month 
notice period and any payments for loss of office will be in line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy disclosed in the 2022 Annual 
Report. Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office and included as exhibits 
to this Annual Report and Form 20-F. The Non-Executive Directors and the Chair were each appointed by a letter of appointment for 
an initial term of three years, and either party may terminate the appointment on three months’ notice, or, if earlier, with the consent 
of the Board. All Non-Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM and there is no provision in 
their letters of appointment giving them a right to compensation upon early termination. 

2023 Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
The Chair is entitled to receive an annual fee which was set at £700,000 per annum for 2023. The 2023 base fee for each other 
Non-Executive Director was £95,000 per annum. Bryan Supran and David Denton are Pfizer employees and do not receive any fees 
for acting as Non-Executive Directors of Haleon plc. Additional fees payable in 2023 were as follows:

 — £50,000 per annum for the Senior Independent Director;
 — £30,000 per annum for the Workforce Engagement Director;
 — £40,000 per annum for chairing the Audit & Risk Committee; 
 — £40,000 per annum for chairing the Remuneration Committee; and
 — £30,000 per annum for chairing the Environmental & Social Sustainability Committee.

Corporate Governance

Corporate Governance

Non-Executive Directors, including the Chair, are encouraged to build up a personal holding in the shares of the Company equal to the 
value of one year of their annual base fee. Executive Directors are required to build and maintain significant holdings of shares in Haleon 
over time (450% of salary for the CEO and 350% of salary for the CFO). Until these requirements have been met, Executive Directors 
are required to hold all Haleon shares acquired under the PSP and/or DABP (net of income tax and National Insurance contributions). 
Executive Directors are required to comply with shareholding requirements for two years after leaving the Company, at a level equal 
to the lower of their shareholding requirement immediately prior to departure or their actual shareholding on departure. During this 
period, former Executive Directors will be required to seek permission to deal from the Company Secretary.

The Board effectiveness review showed that the Board continues to operate effectively. This is attributed to the 
diverse and complementary expertise of the Directors, which promotes balanced decision-making focused on 
long-term sustainable success. Careful procedures manage conflicts of interest should they arise with Directors 
linked to the controlling shareholder, including recusal from certain Board discussions where required. 

The Board has agreed the strategic direction of the Group and monitored the strategy, medium plans and evolution 
of the culture and values at its meetings during 2023. 

68

The Board monitors performance and KPIs through regular updates, presentations and deep dives into key areas. 
The Company’s controls and risk management processes are overseen by the Audit & Risk Committee. 

Stakeholder engagement activities during the period included meetings with major institutional shareholders, 
shareholder representative bodies and employees (through the Workforce Engagement Director). The AGM also 
provides the opportunity for the Board to engage directly with shareholders. 

The Board received updates on policies and practices throughout the period. Any employee can raise matters 
of concern confidentially through the Speak Up programme which is overseen by the Audit & Risk Committee.

Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules
The Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:

 — The Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared in 

accordance with a relevant financial reporting framework, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Parent Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole.

 — The Annual Report, including the Strategic Report, includes a 

fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Parent Company and the Group taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.

 — In accordance with Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 
(DTR) 4.1.16R, the financial statements will form part of the 
annual financial report prepared under DTR 4.1.17R and 
4.1.18R. The auditor’s report on these financial statements 
provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report 
has been prepared in accordance with those requirements.

UK Corporate Governance Code
The Directors consider that this Annual Report and Form 20-F, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and that it 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Parent Company’s and the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the Directors who held office as at the date of approval 
of this Report confirm that:

 — They have taken steps to make themselves aware of relevant 

audit information (as defined by Section 418(3) of the 
Companies Act 2006). 

 — None of the Directors are aware of any relevant audit 

information which has not been disclosed to the Company’s

Financial Statements and accounting records
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial 
Statements for each financial year. The Directors have prepared 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom (UK) adopted international accounting standards in 
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, 
and the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with 
UK accounting standards. The Consolidated Financial Statements, 
also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB), including interpretations issued by the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), and International Financial 
Reporting Standards. Under company law directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Parent 
Company and the Group, and the profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to:

 — Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently.
 — Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable.
 — Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 

specific requirements of the financial reporting framework 
are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance.

 — State whether the Consolidated Financial Statements have 

been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards.

 — State for the Parent Company Financial Statements whether 
applicable UK accounting standards, comprising FRS 102, 
have been followed.

 — Prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 

unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Parent Company 
and the Group will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Parent 
Company and the Group keep adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s and 
the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
the financial position of the Parent Company and the Group to

Item

4.1

4.2

The macro-economic environment has been a driving 
factor in our risk assessment, as general economic 
uncertainty has led to high commodity and other input 
cost inflation affecting many countries the Group 
operates and sells in. Price increases and the impact 
on volumes sold, together with the broader impact on 
margin and operating profit across markets and brands 
are areas considered during our risk assessment.

The Group holds brands with indefinite lives where 
a high degree of estimation uncertainty exists with 
regards to assumptions and estimates used in the 
Group’s analysis of the recoverable amount. The key 
assumptions are terminal growth rate and discount 
rate. There is significant auditor judgement involved 
in evaluating these assumptions. We identified that the 
indefinite life brand most sensitive to possible change 
in key assumptions used in the valuation models is 
Preparation H. The effect of these matters could result 
in a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater 
than our materiality for the financial statements 
as whole.

The investment in subsidiaries in the Parent Company 
Financial Statements is deemed to be material. As a 
result this is considered to be the area that has the 
greatest effect on our overall Parent Company audit.

During the year, the Audit & Risk Committee met seven times. KPMG are invited to attend all Audit & Risk 
Committee meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the Audit & Risk Committee in 
private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out 
communications with the Audit & Risk Committee in section 4, including matters that required particular 
judgement for each. 

The matters included in the Audit & Risk Committee Report on page 74 are materially consistent with our 
observations of those meetings. 

We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, 
and we remain independent of the Group in accordance 
with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.

We have not performed any non-audit services during 
FY23 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC 
Ethical Standard. 

We were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders 
of the Company on 20 April 2023. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement is for one financial year 
ended 31 December 2023. 

The Group engagement partner is required to rotate 
every 5 years. Nicholas Frost became the Group 
engagement partner for the current year and will be 
required to rotate off the engagement following the 
FY27 audit.

Component signing partners served as component 
signing partners for the FY22 PCAOB audit, performed 
by KPMG LLP US, and continue to be involved in the 
Group audit. The average tenure of component signing 
partners, as set out in section 7 is 2 years, with the 
shortest being 1 and the longest being 2.

Materiality 
(Item 6 below)

The scope of our work is influenced by our view of 
materiality and our assessed risk of material misstatement. 

Materiality levels used 
in our audit (£m)

Group Scope 
(Item 7 below)

We have determined overall materiality for the Group 
financial statements as a whole at £100m and for the 
Parent Company financial statements as a whole at £97m. 

Materiality for the Group financial statements as a 
whole was set at £100m, determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group profit before tax, normalised to 
exclude separation costs of £120m, certain restructuring 
costs of £147m, and the impairment of the ChapStick 
brand upon transfer to held for sale of £170m. We adjusted 
for these items because they do not represent the normal, 
continuing operations of the Group. Our Group materiality 
representing 4.8% of this metric. 

Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements 
was determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent 
Company total assets of which it represents 0.4%.

We performed risk assessment and planning procedures 
to determine which of the Group’s components are likely 
to include risks of material misstatement to the Group 
financial statements, the type of procedures to be 
performed at these components and the extent of 
involvement required from our component auditors 
around the world.

The Group audit has 16 in-scope reporting components 
over which we required procedures to be performed to 
provide us with the evidence required to conclude on the 
Group Financial Statements as a whole. We performed 
a full scope audit at 1 component and specified audit 
procedures at 15 components.

The components within the scope of our work accounted 
for the percentages illustrated opposite.

The Group operates four shared service centres, 
in Poland, Malaysia, Costa Rica and India, the outputs 
of which are included in the financial information of the 
reporting components they service and therefore they are 
not separate reporting components. Each of the shared 
service centres is subject to specific risk-focused testing 
of transaction processing and review controls.

The Group team has also performed testing of centrally 
managed controls (manual and automated), testing of 
general IT controls over centrally managed IT systems 
and performance of specific risk focused audit procedures 
over purchases, revenue, payroll and journal entries on 
behalf of the components. 

In addition, we have performed Group level assessment 
on the remaining components to determine whether further 
risks of material misstatement exist in those components. 

The remaining 32% of total Group revenue, 15% of total 
profits and losses comprising Group profit before tax and 
15% of total Group assets is represented by 183 reporting 
components, none of which individually represented more 
than 3% of any of total Group revenue, Group profit before 
tax or total Group assets.

We consider the scope of our audit, as communicated 
to the Audit & Risk Committee, to be an appropriate basis 
for our audit opinion.

The impact of 
climate change 
on our audit

In planning our audit, we considered the impacts of climate change on the Group’s business and its 
financial statements.

The Group set targets to achieve net zero carbon emissions from source to sale by 2040, aligned to guidance 
from the Climate Pledge and Race to Zero. Further information has been provided in the Group’s Strategic 
Report on page 22. The Group continues to align its climate-related disclosures with the recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and the Companies Act. These disclosures 
are included on pages 24-31 of the Annual Report.

Climate change risk could have a significant impact on the Group’s business as it adapts its strategy and 
operations to address the potential financial risks which could arise from both the physical and transition 
risks associated with climate change. To evaluate and assess the resilience of its business to climate change, 
the Group assessed the impact of damage and disruption caused by extreme weather events, reduced 
availability and increased price volatility of raw materials due to climate change, carbon pricing regulations 
and loss of attractiveness due to consumers’ increasing expectations. These are the areas in which the 
Group foresees the greatest potential for disruption. Further information can be found on pages 27 to 31.

As part of our audit, we have made inquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact 
of climate change risk on the Group’s Financial Statements. We have performed a risk assessment of how 
climate risks facing the Group, particularly those relating to the impact of damage and disruption caused by 
extreme weather events, reduced availability and increased price volatility of raw materials due to climate 
change, carbon pricing regulations and loss of attractiveness due to consumers’ increasing expectations, 
and the Group’s strategy to mitigate these risks, may affect the financial statements and our audit. Our risk 
assessment focused on the risk climate change may pose to the determination of future cash flows within 
the Group going concern assessment and assessment over the valuation of indefinite life brands, as well 
as the impact on the carrying amount and useful lives of property, plant, and equipment. We also held 
discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment.

On the basis of our risk assessment, we determined that while climate change poses a risk to the determination 
of future cash flows, the risk to the audit from climate change alone is not significant, as such there was no 
impact on our Key Audit Matters.

We have read the climate-related information in the front half of the Annual Report, and considered 
consistency with the statements and our audit knowledge.

3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the 
Parent Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group’s and the Parent Company’s financial position 
means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt 
over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements 
(the going concern period).

Going concern

We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic 
environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed 
how those risks might affect the Group’s and Company’s financial resources 
or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that 
were considered most likely to adversely affect the Group’s and Company’s 
available financial resources over this period were:

 — Commodity inflation and pricing
 — Selling price and volume sensitivity

We also considered realistic second order impacts, such as business 
transformation and portfolio management failure. 

We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the 
going concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumptions that, 
individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, considering the 
Group’s current projected cash and facilities and the outcome of their reverse 
stress testing. 

We considered whether the going concern disclosure in Note 1 to the 
financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the Directors’ 
assessment of going concern.

Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors’ use of 
the going concern basis of accounting without any material uncertainty for 
the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable. However, as we cannot 
predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result 
in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at 
the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that 
the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.

Our conclusions
 — We consider that the Directors’ use of the going 

concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is appropriate;

 — We have not identified, and concur with the Directors’ 
assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty 
related to events or conditions that, individually or 
collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s 
or Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern for the going concern period;

 — We have nothing material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to the directors’ statement in Note 1 to the 
financial statements on the use of the going concern 
basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt over the Group and Parent 
Company’s use of that basis for the going concern 
period, and we found the going concern disclosure 
in Note 1 to be acceptable; and

 — The related statement under the Listing Rules set out 
on page 190 is materially consistent with the financial 
statements and our audit knowledge.

Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability

Our reporting
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to these disclosures.

We have concluded that these disclosures are materially 
consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.

Our responsibility
We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there 
is a material inconsistency between the directors’ disclosures in 
respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, 
and the financial statements and our audit knowledge. 

Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add 
or draw attention to in relation to:

 — the Directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on 

page 59 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity; 

 — the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how 

emerging risks are identified and explaining how they are being 
managed and mitigated; and 

 — the Directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they considered that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.

We are also required to review the viability statement set out on 
page 59 under the Listing Rules.

Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context 
of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements 
audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and 
as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent 
with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were 
made, the absence of anything to report on these statements 
is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Parent Company’s 
longer-term viability.

4. Key Audit Matters

What we mean

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: 

 — The overall audit strategy; 
 — The allocation of resources in the audit; and
 — Directing the efforts of the engagement team.

We include below the Key Audit Matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those 
matters and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, 
for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Financial Statement Elements

Our results

Intangible Assets — Indefinite life brands

Intangible Assets — Impairment

FY23

£18,073m

£184m

Description of the Key Audit Matter
Forecast-based assessment
Indefinite life brands are impaired when their carrying amount 
exceeds their recoverable amount. There is inherent uncertainty with 
regard to assumptions and estimates involved in the Group’s forecast 
based assessment of the recoverable amount of indefinite life 
brands. In particular, there is significant auditor judgement involved 
in evaluating the terminal growth rate and discount rate used in the 
analysis of the recoverable amount of the indefinite life brands.

The indefinite life brands most at risk of material misstatement 
were identified using sensitivity analysis on key assumptions and 
a review of potential triggering events that could be indicative of 
an impairment in the carrying value of the brands. An impairment 
charge of £129m was recognised during the prior year, largely in 
relation to Preparation H, with an impairment charge of £184m 
recognised during the current year, largely in relation to the 
impairment of the ChapStick brand upon transfer to held-for-sale 
of £170m. We identified that the indefinite life brand most 
sensitive to possible change in key assumptions used in the 
valuation models is Preparation H, for which the carrying value 
is £1,103m as at 31 December 2023. 

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, 
we determined that the evaluation of the recoverability of the 
carrying value of Preparation H has a high degree of estimation 
uncertainty with a potential range of reasonable outcomes 
greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a 
whole. The financial statements (Note 14) disclose the sensitivity 
estimated by the Group for this brand.

FY23: Acceptable

Our response to the risk
Our procedures to address the risk included:
 — Control design and operation: Evaluating the design and testing the 

operating effectiveness of certain internal controls within the indefinite 
life brands impairment testing process, including controls related 
to the development of the terminal growth rate and discount rate;
 — Sensitivity analysis: Performing sensitivity analysis on the terminal 
growth rate and discount rate to assess their impact on the Group’s 
determination that the fair value less cost to sell (FVLCTS) exceeds 
the carrying value;

 — Valuation expertise: Involving our own valuation professional with 
specialised skills and knowledge, who assisted in independently 
developing a range of terminal growth rate and discount rate using 
publicly available market data for comparable companies and comparing 
these rates to those utilised by the Group to assess their reasonableness; 

 — Historical comparison: Challenging projected revenue by comparing 
historical projections to actual results to assess the Group’s ability 
to accurately forecast;

 — Benchmarking and assessing assumptions: Assessing and challenging 
revenue growth rate against externally derived publicly available data, 
including broker and analyst reports, industry reports, media reports, 
macro-economic assumptions, academic and scientific studies, and 
regulatory changes; and

 — Assessing transparency: Assessing whether the Group’s disclosures 
detail the critical estimates and sensitivities including any impact 
of reasonable possible changes regarding the impairment testing 
of indefinite life brands.

Communications with Haleon plc’s Audit & Risk Committee 
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee included:
 — Our approach to the audit of indefinite life brands, including details of our planned substantive procedures and extent of our controls reliance;
 — Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the Group’s impairment assessment, including assumptions used by the Group in their 
FVLCTS based assessment to calculate the recoverable amount of indefinite life brands and whether the terminal growth rate and 
discount rate used by the Group were reasonable; and

 — The adequacy of disclosures, particularly as it relates to the critical estimates and sensitivities with regard to the impairment testing. 

Areas of particular auditor judgement 
The evaluation of the assumptions used by the Group in the analysis of the recoverable amount of indefinite life brands is an area requiring 
significant auditor judgement. The assumptions are the terminal growth rate and discount rate.

Our results 
We found the indefinite life brands balance, and the related impairment charge, to be acceptable.

Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Audit & Risk Committee Report on page 72 for details on how the 
Audit & Risk Committee considered recoverable amount of indefinite life brands as an area of significant attention, Note 3 for 
the accounting policy on indefinite life brands and Note 14 for the financial disclosures.

Investment in Subsidiaries

FY23

£22,266m

FY23: Acceptable

Description of the Key Audit Matter
Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries 
represents 99.9% of the Company’s total assets. 

We do not consider the carrying amounts of these investments 
to be at a high risk of significant misstatement, or to be subject to 
a significant level of judgement. However, due to their materiality 
in context of the Parent Company accounts, this is considered to 
be the area with the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy 
and allocation of resources in planning and completing our audit 
of the parent company.

Our response to the risk
We performed a substantive approach rather than seeking to rely on 
any of the company’s controls because the nature of the balance is 
such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through 
the detailed procedures described below.

Our procedures to address the risk included:
 — Tests of detail: Comparing the carrying amount of the Parent 

Company’s direct investments with the relevant subsidiary’s draft 
balance sheet to identify whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of the minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of 
their carrying amount and assessing whether those subsidiaries have 
historically been profit making;

 — Comparing valuations: Comparing the carrying amount of the 

Company’s investment in subsidiaries with the expected value of the 
business based on the net assets of the Group, as well as to the market 
capitalisation; and 

 — Indicators: Evaluating the considerations of indicators of impairment 

of the Parent Company’s direct investments.

Communications with Haleon plc’s Audit & Risk Committee 
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit & Risk Committee included:
 — Our approach to the audit of the recoverability of the parent company’s investments in subsidiaries, including the planned substantive 

procedures; and

 — An assessment of indicators of impairment from the conclusion reached in the Group impairment workings.

Our results 
We found the conclusion that there is no impairment of the investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable.

Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See Note 2 of the parent company financial statements for the accounting 
policy and Note 5 of the parent company financial statements for the financial disclosures.

Fraud — identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud

Fraud Risk Assessment 

Risk communications

Fraud risks

To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (fraud risks) we assessed events or 
conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud, or provide an opportunity 
to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:
 — Inquiring of directors, the Audit & Risk Committee, internal audit and inspection of policy 

documentation as to the Group’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect 
fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group’s channel for “whistleblowing”, 
as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;

 — Reading Board and Audit & Risk Committee minutes;
 — Considering remuneration and incentive schemes and performance targets for senior 

management;

 — Using analytical procedures to identify unusual or unexpected relationships; and
 — Using our own forensic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist us 
in identifying the fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group.

We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any 
indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to 
component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and requests to 
component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could 
give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.

As required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, 
we performed procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular 
the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate 
accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates. On this audit we do not believe 
there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition as the revenue model is non-complex with 
limited estimation or manual intervention. Revenue is disaggregated between a significant 
number of components and remuneration targets are based on Group performance rather than 
component performance.

We did not identify any additional fraud risks.

Procedures to address 
fraud risks

In determining the audit procedures, we have taken into account the results of our evaluation 
and testing of the operating effectiveness of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls.

We also performed the following:

 — Identifying journal entries to test for all in-scope components based on risk criteria and 

comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included journal entries 
posted to seldom used accounts, journal entries posted by a user who only posted few entries 
for the fiscal year, journal entries containing a pre-defined list of keywords and those posted 
with an unusual account combination; and

 — Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative 

of a potential bias.

Context

Context of the ability 
of the audit to detect 
fraud or breaches of 
law or regulation

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material 
effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through 
discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by the auditing standards), from 
inspection of the Group’s regulatory and legal correspondence and discussion with the Directors and 
other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any 
indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group 
to in-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at a Group level, 
and requested for in-scope component auditors to report any instances of non-compliance with 
laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at a Group level.

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. 

Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements 
including financial reporting legislation (including related companies’ legislation), distributable 
profits legislation and taxation legislation. We assessed the extent of compliance with these laws 
and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.

Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences 
of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial 
statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following 
areas as those most likely to have such an effect:

 — Competition legislation (reflecting the Group’s involvement in a number of ongoing 

investigations by national competition authorities);

 — Employment legislation (reflecting the Group’s significant and geographically diverse work force);
 — Health and safety regulation (reflecting the nature of the Group’s production and 

distribution processes);

 — Consumer product law such as product safety and product claims (reflecting the nature of the 

Group’s diverse product base);

 — Fraud, corruption and bribery legislation, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK 

bribery act (reflecting the Group’s global operations, including higher risk jurisdictions);

 — Sanctions (reflecting the Group’s global operations, including higher risk jurisdictions);
 — Contract legislation (reflecting the Group’s extensive use of trademarks, copyright and patents);
 — Data privacy (requirements from existing data privacy laws); and
 — Environmental regulation (reflecting nature of the Group’s production and distribution processes).

Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws 
and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory 
and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed 
to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.

In relation to the criminal investigations into allegations of misconduct by competition investigation 
in Germany discussed in Note 22, we performed inquiries, obtained legal confirmations, and 
assessed disclosures against our understanding from legal correspondence.

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have 
detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly 
planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further 
removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected 
in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing 
standards would identify it. 

In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are 
not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect 
non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

6. Our determination of materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative 
considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.

£100M
Materiality for 
the group financial 
statements as a whole

What we mean 
A quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.

Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £100m, determined with reference to 
a benchmark of Group profit before tax, normalised to exclude specific separation costs of £120m, certain 
restructuring costs of £147m, and the impairment of the ChapStick brand upon transfer to held for sale of 
£170m. We adjusted for these items because they do not represent the normal, continuing operations of 
the Group. 

We determined that normalised Profit before Taxation is the main benchmark for the Group. We consider 
normalised Profit before Taxation to be a key indicator of performance, the basis for earnings, and therefore 
the primary focus of a reasonable investor. We have inspected analyst consensus data and other investor 
commentary for signals of alternate significant influencers of economic decisions. No revisions to our 
calculation methodology resulted therefrom.

Our Group materiality of £100m was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised Profit before 
Taxation. When using a benchmark of normalised Profit before Taxation to determine overall materiality, 
KPMG’s approach for listed considers a guideline range up to 5% of the measure. In setting overall Group 
materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.8% to the benchmark. 

Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at £97m, determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets, of which it represents 0.4%.

£75M
Performance 
materiality 

What we mean
Our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, 
performance materiality, to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements 
in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.

Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied 
The Group performance materiality was set at £75m, which equates to 75% of materiality for Haleon plc’s 
Group financial statements as a whole. 

The Parent Company performance materiality was set at £74m, which equates to 75% of materiality for the 
Parent Company financial statements as a whole. 

We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because, although we did 
identify specific IT findings, the majority of factors did not indicate an elevated level of risk.

£5M
Audit misstatement 
posting threshold

What we mean 
This is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a 
quantitative point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter 
the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements 
which are indicators of fraud. 

This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Haleon plc’s 
Audit & Risk Committee.

Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and 
judgements applied 
We set our audit misstatement posting threshold at £5m, which equates to 5% of our materiality for the 
Group financial statements. We also report to the Audit & Risk Committee any other identified 
misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.

The overall materiality for the Group financial statements of £100m compares as follows to the main financial statement caption

7. The scope of our audit

Group scope

What we mean
How the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.

The Group has 199 reporting components that are primarily country based. In order to determine 
the work performed at the reporting component level, we identified those components which 
we consider to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to risk and 
those remaining components on which we are required to perform procedures to provide us with 
the evidence we require in order to conclude on the Group financial statements as a whole.

The Group has 16 in-scope reporting components over which we required procedures to be 
performed to provide us with the evidence required to conclude on the Group Financial Statements 
as a whole. We performed a full scope audit at 1 component and specified audit procedures at 
15 components. The Group team performed procedures on the items excluded from normalised 
Group profit before tax.

We have determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 
10% of revenue or total assets. We selected revenue and total assets because these are the most 
representative of the relative size of components. All individually financially significant components 
are full-scope audits. The components for which we performed specified audit procedures were 
not financially significant enough to require a full scope audit for Group reporting purposes but 
did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed.

In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine 
whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.

In addition to the full scope audit over one component, we subjected 12 components to specified 
risk-focused audit procedures over revenue, 10 components to specific risk-focused audit 
procedures over purchases, 10 components to specific risk focused audit procedures over inventory, 
4 components to specific risk focused audit procedures over income tax and 3 components to 
specific risk-focused audit procedures over payroll expenses.

We were able to rely upon the Group’s internal control over financial reporting in some areas 
of our audit, where our controls testing supported this approach, which enabled us to reduce the 
scope of our substantive audit work; in the other areas the scope of the audit work performed 
was fully substantive.

The Group operates four shared service centres in Poland, Malaysia, Costa Rica and India. 
Their outputs are included in the financial information of the reporting components they service 
and therefore are not considered separate reporting components. 

The Group audit team and shared service centre teams have performed audit procedures on the 
following areas of behalf of the components: 

 — Testing of manual controls operated from the Group’s shared service centres;
 — Testing of automated controls and system generated information within centrally managed 

IT systems

 — Testing of general IT controls over centrally managed IT systems; and
 — Performance of specific risk focused audit procedures over purchases, revenue, payroll and 

journal entries

The Group team instructed auditors of the shared service centres to perform specified risk-focused 
audit procedures, predominantly the testing of transaction processing and review controls, and 
the information to be reported back. Additional procedures are performed at certain reporting 
components to address the audit risks not covered by the work performed over the shared 
service centres.

These items were audited centrally because the processes and controls were operated and 
managed centrally at the Group or shared service centre level. The Group team communicated the 
results of these procedures to the component teams. The work on all components was performed 
by component auditors, whilst the parent company audit was performed by the Group team.

Group audit 
team oversight

What we mean 
The extent of the Group audit team’s involvement in component audits.

As part of determining the scope and preparing our audit plan and strategy the Group audit team held 
various meetings with our component auditors across the world to discuss key audit risks and obtain input 
from component teams.

Instructions
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the areas to be covered, including the relevant 
risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.

The Group audit team allocated components materialities and approved the statutory materiality when 
components used it for reporting purposes, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the components.

Virtual meetings and calls
The Group audit team held regular virtual meetings with the component auditors in scope for Group 
reporting. These meetings were held to understand the business, any updates to the risk assessment and 
any issues and findings. The findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail with 
component auditors and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the 
component auditors.

Global conference
The Group team hosted a conference in June 2023 in London. This conference emphasised key areas of the 
Group audit instructions and allowed for the sharing of risk assessment considerations and Group updates. 
It helped the Group team to enhance our understanding of the component auditors’ perspective on the 
overall audit approach and improve two-way communication.

The conference covered key Group developments, the origins of risk and the deployment of data and 
analytic tools.

Site visits
The Group audit team visited the following component teams during the year:

 — Shared Service Centres: Poland, Malaysia, Costa Rica and India
 — Other component auditors: United States, China, Switzerland, Italy and Japan

Review of work papers
The Group audit team also inspected selections of the component team’s key work papers related to 
significant and certain other audit risks and assessed the appropriateness of conclusions and consistencies 
between reported findings and work performed.

9. Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 98, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group 
and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 

The Company is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared under Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules (DTR) 4.1.17R and 4.1.18R. This auditor’s report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has 
been prepared in accordance with those requirements.

10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 
and the terms of our engagement by the Company. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Haleon plc:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Haleon plc and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023, 
the related consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow 
statement for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also 
have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position 
of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023, 
in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB). Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as 
of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions 
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control 
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the 
accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our 
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and 
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable 
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, 
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. 
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well 
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting 
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also 
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide 
a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements 
that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that 
is material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 
The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as 
a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or 
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Assessment of the recoverable amounts for the Preparation H intangible assets 
As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2023, the Company has £1,103 million of 
indefinite useful life intangible asset related to its Preparation H brand. As discussed in Note 3, the Company performs impairment 
testing on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a brand’s carrying value may exceed its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount utilised in the impairment test is estimated using a fair value less costs to sell model, 
which relies on certain assumptions and estimates. Key assumptions and estimates used by management in determining the 
recoverable amounts include the terminal growth rate and discount rate. 

We identified the assessment of the recoverable amount for the Preparation H intangible asset as a critical audit matter. A high 
degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the terminal growth rate and discount rate used to estimate the recoverable 
amount of the brand. The terminal growth rate and discount rate included subjective determinations of future market and economic 
conditions that were sensitive to variation. Minor changes to the assumptions used could have had a significant effect on the 
Company’s determination of the recoverable amount. Additionally, specialised skills and knowledge were needed to evaluate 
the discount rate.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter:

 — evaluated the design and tested operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indefinite life brands 

impairment process. This included controls over the development of the terminal growth rate and discount rate

 — challenged the Company’s terminal growth rate by comparing to publicly available data
 — performed sensitivity analysis on the terminal growth rate and discount rate to assess their impact on the Company’s 

determination that the fair value exceeds the carrying value 

 — involved a valuation professional with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in independently developing a range of 
discount rates and terminal growth rates using publicly available market data for comparable companies and comparing these 
rates with the rates by the Company.

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors.
Haleon plc:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Haleon plc and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, 
the related consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement 
for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the 
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, 
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance 
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit(s) in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether 
due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated 
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements 
that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that 
are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 
The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken 
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter 
or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Impairment testing of Indefinite Life Brands
As disclosed in Notes 3 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2022, the Company’s balance sheet 
includes £19,333 million of indefinite useful life intangible assets related to its brands (Indefinite Life Brands). The Company 
performs impairment testing on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a brand’s carrying 
value may exceeds its recoverable amounts. The recoverable amounts utilized in the impairment tests are estimated using a fair 
value less costs to sell model, which relies on certain assumptions and estimates. Key assumptions and estimates used by 
management in determining the recoverable amounts include revenue growth rates and discount rates.

We identified the impairment testing of Indefinite Life Brands as a critical audit matter. A high degree of challenging auditor judgment 
was required to evaluate the projected revenue growth rates and discount rates used to estimate the recoverable amounts of the 
brands. The revenue growth rates and discount rates included subjective determinations of future market and economic conditions 
that were sensitive to variation. Minor changes to assumptions used could have had a significant effect on the Company’s 
determination of the recoverable amounts. Additionally, specialized skills and knowledge were needed to evaluate the discount rates. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design of certain 
internal controls related to the Indefinite Life Brands impairment process. This included controls over the development of the 
revenue growth rates and discount rates. We evaluated the revenue growth rates used in the Indefinite Life Brands impairment by: 

 — comparing the Company’s historical forecasts to actual results to evaluate the Company’s historical ability to accurately forecast
 — comparing the Company’s historical results to the forecasts to evaluate the Company’s ability to accurately forecast
 — comparing the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data to assess the 

reasonableness of the assumptions used.

We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the discount rates used in 
the impairment tests by comparing them to discount rates that were developed using publicly available market data, including that 
of comparable companies.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Financial Statements

1. General information
Haleon is a public company limited by shares, incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with registered number 13691224. 
The Company has ordinary shares with a nominal value of £0.01 per share. The Group’s shares are listed and traded on the London Stock 
Exchange (LSE) with American Depositary Shares (ADSs) listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) (LSE/NYSE: HLN). 
The registered address of the Company is Building 5, First Floor, The Heights, Weybridge, Surrey, England, KT13 0NY.

Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB IFRS), including interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(IFRIC) and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom (UK IFRS) (together IFRS) and the Companies 
Act 2006. IFRS as adopted by the UK differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. The differences have no impact on the 
Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the years presented.

Until July 2022, Haleon UK Holdings (No.2) Limited (HHL2) (previously, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings (No.2) Limited 
(CHHL2)), the former ultimate holding company of the Group and the accounting predecessor, was jointly owned by GSK plc and its 
subsidiaries which held the majority controlling equity interest of 68%, and Pfizer Inc. and its subsidiaries which held a non-controlling 
equity interest of 32%. In July 2022, following the execution of a series of legal acts and contractual arrangements, including the 
spin-off to the shareholders of GSK, the Company was established to succeed HHL2 as the new ultimate holding company of the 
Group, with 55% of its equity interest held by the shareholders of GSK, 32% of its equity interest held by Pfizer and approximately 13% 
of its equity interest held by GSK. This corporate restructuring was contemplated and executed as one single economic event yet 
sequenced via multiple legal proceedings and activities. Management concluded that the predecessor (carryover) basis of accounting 
is appropriate because the corporate restructuring was instigated by GSK and its shareholders without the involvement of outside 
third parties or new investors.

This set of Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared as if the Group had been in existence throughout all the periods 
presented by applying the principles of predecessor accounting in accordance with SEC Regulation C Rule 405 and IFRS although the 
actual legal transaction and corporate reorganisation occurred in July 2022. There was no economic change or event impacting the 
reporting entity because the business activities of the predecessor and successor remained identical and only the legal form and 
ownership allocation has changed. 

Accounting convention
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on a historical cost basis unless otherwise indicated. The Consolidated Financial 
Statements are presented in Pound Sterling (GBP, £), the functional currency of the Company and presentation currency of the Group, 
and all values are denominated in millions of GBP (£m or £ million) unless stated otherwise.

Financial period
These Consolidated Financial Statements cover the financial year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, with comparative figures 
for the financial years from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 and from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.

Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s cash flow forecasts, financial position and exposure to principal risks and have formed the 
view that the Group will generate sufficient cash to meet its ongoing requirements for at least 12 months from the date the Financial 
Statements have been authorised. At 31 December 2023, the Group had cash and cash equivalents, net of bank overdrafts, of £994m 
and undrawn credit facilities of $1.3bn and £900m with initial maturity dates of September 2024 and September 2026, respectively. 
As a result, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Group’s 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Basis of consolidation
Entities over which the Group has the power to direct the relevant activities so as to affect the returns to the Group, generally through 
control over the financial and operating policies from either voting or contractual rights, are accounted for as subsidiaries. Interests 
acquired in entities are consolidated from the date the Group acquires control and interests sold are deconsolidated from the date 
control ceases.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

121

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued

Where, as part of a business combination, the Group is not able to exercise control over a particular operation due to the existence of 
legal or other restrictions, the associated assets and liabilities are not consolidated, and a financial asset or liability is recognised for 
the economic benefit or obligation to be received under the contribution agreement. The assets and liabilities are consolidated, and the 
associated financial asset or liability derecognised, on the date at which the Group is able to exercise control over these operations.

Transactions and balances between subsidiaries are eliminated and no profit before tax is recognised on sales between subsidiaries 
until the products are sold to customers outside the Group. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity. 
Deferred tax relief on unrealised intra-group profit is accounted for only to the extent that it is considered recoverable. Refer to Note 
30 ‘Subsidiaries’ for a list of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings. 

Foreign currencies
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in GBP, which is also the Company’s functional currency. Each entity in the 
Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that 
functional currency.

Foreign currency transactions in individual Group companies are translated into functional currency using exchange rates at the date 
of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses from settlement of these transactions, and from translation of monetary assets 
and liabilities at the rates prevailing on the reporting period date, are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in 
equity as qualifying hedges. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was measured. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the balances in individual Group companies are translated from their functional 
currency into GBP. The income statement, the cash flow statement and all other movements in assets and liabilities are translated at 
average rates of exchange as a proxy for the transaction rate, or at the transaction rate itself if more appropriate. Assets and liabilities 
are translated at the closing rates at the end of the reporting period.

The effect of exchange rate differences during the year on net assets of foreign operations is recorded in equity.

The Group applies hedge accounting to certain exchange differences arising between the functional currencies of a foreign operation 
and the functional currency of the parent entity, regardless of whether the net investment is held directly or through an intermediate 
parent. Differences arising on retranslation of a financial liability designated as a foreign currency net investment hedge are recorded in 
other comprehensive income/(expenses) and accumulated in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective, which may be subsequently 
reclassified to the consolidated income statement. These differences are reported within profit or loss to the extent that the hedge is 
ineffective. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal or partial 
disposal of the foreign operation.

Impact of climate change
In preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements we have considered the impact of climate change. The Group does not believe 
that there is a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates arising from climate change in the short term and 
as a result the valuation of our assets and liabilities has not been significantly impacted by these risks as at 31 December 2023. 
In concluding, we specifically considered the impact of climate change on the following areas:

Financial Statement area

Relevant climate-related risks

Relevant ESG targets

Property, plant and equipment 

 — Damage and disruption caused 
by extreme weather events
 — Carbon pricing regulations

Note 14 ‘Intangible assets’

Note 15 ‘Inventories’

Going concern and viability

 — Damage and disruption caused

Viability assessment

Whilst there is currently no short-term impact anticipated from climate change, the judgements and estimates of the Group will be regularly 
reviewed in light of the increasing risks and dynamic regulatory landscape as this continues to evolve.

2. Accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are the same as those which were applied for the previous financial year except as set out below under 
the heading ‘Recent accounting developments’.

Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the policy is described 
within that note.

The accounting policies below have been applied throughout the Consolidated Financial Statements and apply to the Financial 
Statements as a whole.

Revenue
The Group receives revenue for supply of goods to external customers against orders received. The majority of contracts that the Group 
enters into relate to sales orders containing single performance obligations for the delivery of consumer health products. 

Product revenue is recognised when control of the goods is passed to the customer. The point at which control passes is determined by 
each customer arrangement, but generally occurs on delivery to the customer.

Revenue represents net invoice value (i.e., list price after the deduction of discounts, pricing allowances, customer incentives, promotional 
rebates and coupons). Revenue includes fixed and variable consideration.

Variable consideration arises on the sale of goods as a result of discounts and allowances given and accruals for estimated future returns 
and rebates. Discounts can either be on-invoice or off-invoice whilst allowances and rebates are generally off-invoice. The discounts, 
allowances and promotional rebates are recognised as a deduction from revenue at the time that the related revenue is recognised or 
when the Group has committed to pay the consideration, whichever is later. Variable consideration is not included in the transaction 
price until it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued

The methodology and assumptions used to estimate returns and rebates are monitored and adjusted regularly in light of contractual 
and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions. Once the uncertainty associated with the 
returns and rebates is resolved, revenue is adjusted accordingly. The differences between actual amounts settled and the estimated 
accrued amounts are recognised as a change in management estimate in the subsequent reporting period. The assumptions used in 
estimation are based on known facts with a high level of accuracy. In addition, the Group’s promotional programmes are typically 
short-term in nature resulting in lower inherent estimation uncertainty.

Some contracts for the sale of consumer health products provide customers with a right to return the goods within a specified period. 
A refund liability is recognised for the goods that are expected to be returned (i.e., the amount not included in the transaction price). 
A right of return asset (and the corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) is also recognised for the right to recover the goods from 
the customer. The Group uses the most likely amount method to estimate the variable consideration in contracts with a right to return.

The Group also provides retrospective volume rebates to certain customers once the products purchased during the period exceed the 
threshold specified in the contract. A refund liability is recognised for the expected future rebates (i.e., the amount not included in the 
transaction price). The Group applies the most likely amount method to estimate the variable consideration in the contract related to 
rebates. Volume rebates and refund liabilities are recognised in trade and other payables.

The Group has elected to apply the practical expedient not to disclose the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to performance 
obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as at the end of the reporting period. 

Research and development
Research and development (R&D) expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. R&D expenditure 
comprises expenditure that is directly attributable to the research and development of new products or variants, including the costs 
attributable to the generation or improvement of intellectual property and product registrations, depreciation and amortisation of 
equipment, real estate and IT assets used by the R&D function. 

Recent accounting developments
On 20 June 2023, the UK Finance (No.2) Bill 2022-23 was substantively enacted in the UK, including legislation to implement in the UK 
certain parts of the OECD’s Pillar Two regime for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Refer to Note 9 ‘Taxation’ for further 
information about the anticipated impact of this legislation. On 19 July 2023, the UK Endorsement Board adopted the temporary, 
mandatory deferred tax exception to IAS 12, as issued by the IASB in May 2023. The exception has been applied and the Group has 
neither recognised nor disclosed information about deferred tax assets or liabilities relating to Pillar Two income taxes. 

IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ is effective from 1 January 2023 and introduces a new model for accounting for insurance contracts. 
We have reviewed existing arrangements and concluded that IFRS 17 is not material for the Group. We have also reviewed other new 
standards or amendments to standards that have been issued by the IASB and are effective from 1 January 2023 and concluded that 
they are not material to the Group.

All new accounting standards, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations that have been published by the IASB and 
are not effective for 31 December 2023 reporting periods, have not been early adopted by the Group. These standards, amendments 
or interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods.

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make judgements about when or how items should be 
recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements and estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates.

There are no critical accounting judgements. The following is the key source of estimation uncertainty.

Indefinite life brands
Estimation of the recoverable amount of indefinite life brands requires significant estimates of the value of each brand. The Group 
reviews indefinite life brands for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. The 
recoverable amounts of indefinite life brands are estimated using the fair value less costs to sell methodology. These calculations 
use management’s estimates consistent with current budgets and plans that have been formally approved, assumptions of market 
participants and are based on discounted cash flow forecasts using estimated long-term growth rates. Refer to Note 14 ‘Intangible 
assets’ for further details about the Group’s indefinite life brands and sensitivity analysis of Preparation H.

4. Segment information
The Group is organised into business units based on geographical areas and has three reportable segments:

 — North America
 — Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America (EMEA & LatAm)
 — Asia Pacific (APAC)

No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.

The Group’s Commercial Operations Board, which consists of the CEO, CFO and other members of senior leadership, is the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (CODM) who monitors the operating results of the Group’s reportable segments separately for the purpose 
of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. The CODM uses a measure of adjusted operating profit 
to assess the performance of the reportable segments. Adjusted operating profit is defined as operating profit less net intangible 
amortisation and impairment of brands, licences, and patents, restructuring costs, transaction-related costs, separation and admission 
costs, and disposals and others. The CODM does not review IFRS operating profit or total assets on a segment basis.

The composition of these geographical segments is reviewed on an annual basis. Analysis of revenue and adjusted operating profit 
by geographical segment is included below:

5. Other operating (expense)/ income
Other operating expense/income includes income and expense from all other operating activities which are not related to the 
ordinary course of business of the Group, such as gains/losses from disposals and transaction-related costs.

In 2023, the Group recognised £10m loss on disposal of the Lamisil brand.

In 2022, the Group recognised a £24m gain on the disposal of the Polocard brand, a product sold in Poland. In 2021 the Group 
recognised a net gain on disposals of intangible assets and businesses of £31m, which included divestments of Transderm Scop, 
Acne-Aid and Baldriparan.

6. Operating profit
Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms. Provision is 
made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably 
estimated. Advertising & Promotion (A&P) expenditure is charged to the income statement as incurred. Shipment costs on intercompany 
transfers are charged to cost of sales; distribution costs on sales to customers are included in selling, general and administration (SG&A).

Separation and admission costs represent costs incurred in relation to and in connection with the separation and listing of the Group as 
a standalone business in 2022. Separation and admission costs are reported within cost of sales (2023: £4m, 2022: £4m, 2021: £nil) and 
the selling, general and administration expense (2023: £116m, 2022: £407m, £2021: £278m).

Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs are recognised and provided for, where appropriate, in respect of the direct expenditure of a business reorganisation 
where the plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where a valid expectation to those affected has been created by either 
starting to implement the restructuring plans or announcing its main features. Restructuring costs are those mainly related to specific 
Board-approved restructuring programmes, including integration costs following material acquisitions, which are structural in nature 
and significant in scale.

Restructuring costs include severance and other personnel costs, professional fees, impairments of assets, and other related items.

Haleon may undertake restructuring programmes in response to changes in the Group’s trading environment and overall strategy or 
following significant acquisitions. Costs, both cash and non-cash, of these programmes are provided for as individual elements are 
approved and meet the accounting recognition criteria. As a result, charges may be incurred over a number of years following the 
initiation of a major restructuring programme.

Restructuring costs in 2023 mainly relate to business transformation activities associated with our programme to increase productivity 
and agility. In 2022 and 2021, restructuring costs mainly related to activities aiming to generate synergies from the integration of the 
Pfizer Group’s Consumer Healthcare business into the Group’s business, following the Pfizer Transaction completed on 31 July 2019. 
Refer to Note 21 ‘Provisions’ for further details about the Group’s restructuring provisions.

Fees payable to the Group’s auditors (and their associates) included in operating profit
In April 2023 KPMG LLP (UK) was appointed as external auditor for the Group. In the previous year, in light of UK and US rules on 
independence, the Group had two external auditors KPMG LLP (US) and Deloitte LLP. KPMG LLP (US) was appointed to conduct an 
audit of the Group’s financial statements under the rules and standards of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the 
US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards. Deloitte LLP was engaged in respect of the statutory audit of 
the financial statements of the Group’s parent company and its subsidiaries in accordance with International Standards of Auditing 
(UK ISAs). A fee breakdown for each firm is shown in the table below.

Directors’ remuneration
In 2021, two of GSK nominated Directors had responsibility for managing the Consumer Healthcare business and also undertook a 
variety of work relating to the wider GSK. It is not deemed practicable to make an apportionment of remuneration for the Company. 
The remainder were remunerated as Executives of GSK or Pfizer and received no remuneration in respect of their services to the Company.

8. Net finance costs
Net finance costs comprise finance expense and finance income. Finance income includes income on cash and cash equivalents and 
income on other financial assets. Finance expense includes interest costs in relation to financial liabilities including interest on bonds 
and lease liabilities, which represents the unwind of the discount rate applied to lease liabilities. Borrowing costs are recognised based 
on the effective interest method.

Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year, and any adjustments in respect of prior periods. Taxable 
profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in 
different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the 
amount expected to be paid to, or received from, tax authorities. It is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.

Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different 
taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive 
income/(expense) or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income/(expense) or in equity.

The Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when it is probable that a tax authority would not accept an uncertain 
tax treatment. This is done by assuming the tax authority will examine all the amounts and would have full knowledge of all related 
information when making those examinations. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue-by-issue basis within 
the jurisdictions that we operate either using management’s estimate of the most likely outcome where the issues are binary, or the 
expected value approach where the issues have a range of possible outcomes.

Where open tax matters exist, the ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon 
the outcome of negotiations with the relevant tax authorities or, if necessary, litigation proceedings. At 31 December 2023, the Group 
had recognised provisions of £148m in respect of such uncertain tax positions (2022: £159m and 2021: £150m). Due to the number 
of uncertain tax positions held and the number of jurisdictions to which these relate, it is not practicable to give meaningful 
sensitivity estimates.

The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and any penalties, if applicable, as part of the income 
tax expense.

The Group has a substantial business presence in many countries around the world. The effect of overseas tax rates represents the 
tax impact on profits arising outside the UK that are then taxed at rates different to the statutory rate in the UK. In 2023 this results 
in a reduction to the tax charge due to the increase in the statutory rate of tax in the UK, whereas in 2022 and 2021 this impact was 
to increase the tax charge. In all years, beneficial incentives offered in certain countries have reduced the overall tax charge.

The tax effect of disposals, acquisitions and transfers can vary from the accounting profit or loss that arises. The items recorded in 
2023 and 2021 relate to intra-group transfers. The tax impact of these transfers are a charge and a credit respectively, reflected in 
deferred tax, and relates to the different tax rates and rules that exist in various jurisdictions around the world.

Items non-deductible/taxable for tax purposes include irrecoverable withholding taxes, charges on controlled foreign companies, 
as well as legal and transactional fees that are not deductible for tax purposes.

The re-assessment of prior year estimates includes settlements reached following conclusion of tax authority review and differences 
between final tax return submissions and liabilities accrued in these financial statements; the release of prior year uncertain tax 
positions and a one-off deferred tax adjustment of £37m. 

The impact of changes in tax rates results from the revaluation of temporary differences due to new tax rates coming into force. In 2023, 
this primarily relates to new Cantonal legislation substantively enacted in Switzerland that increases the applicable tax rate from 2025. 
In 2022 and 2021, similar changes to tax rates impacted the Group in the US and the UK respectively. 

Future tax charges, and therefore the effective tax rate, may be affected by factors such as acquisitions, disposals, restructurings, the 
location of research and development activity, tax regime reforms, agreements with tax authorities and resolution of open matters as 
the Group continues to bring its tax affairs up to date around the world.

On 20 June 2023, the UK Finance (No.2) Bill 2022-23 was substantively enacted in the UK, including legislation to implement in the UK 
certain parts of the OECD’s Pillar Two regime for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. These rules will apply to the Group. 
The primary purpose of this legislation is to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15%, to address concerns about the tax 
contributions of large multinationals. The Group operates in territories where the tax rate is below 15%.

Tax authorities around the world are responding to the new rules in a variety of ways, with examples being the introduction of 
corporate income tax, amendments to statutory rates of tax, and the introduction of ‘Domestic Minimum Top Up Taxes’. The precise 
implementation of the changes will dictate how any additional tax will be calculated and reported by the Group in the future. Based 
on the rules in force at the reporting date, it is estimated that the impact of Pillar Two will increase the adjusted effective tax rate of 
the Group by less than 1%, primarily driven by top up taxes in respect of Switzerland.

In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, tax of £6m has been credited directly to equity or through 
comprehensive income/(expense) (2022: £73m debit, 2021: £14m debit) of which a £5m credit (2022: £5m debit, 2021: £nil), is included 
in current tax and a £1m credit (2022: £68m debit, 2021: £14m debit) is included in deferred tax and principally relates to cash flow 
hedges and post-employment benefits.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. 
It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or 
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 

Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax 
liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill. In addition, the Group 
has neither recognised nor disclosed information about deferred tax assets or liabilities relating to Pillar Two income taxes as required 
by the temporary, mandatory deferred tax exception to IAS 12. Refer to Note 2 ‘Accounting policies’.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s 
assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.

Provision for deferred tax liabilities of £37m (2022: £40m) has been made in respect of the taxation that would arise on the future 
distribution of retained profits by certain overseas subsidiaries. Deferred tax is not provided on temporary differences of £206m 
(2022: £385m) arising on unremitted profits as management can control any future reversal and does not consider such a reversal 
to be probable.

The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset for trading losses of £11m (2022: £14m) on the basis of management forecasts which 
demonstrate these losses should be recovered in the foreseeable future. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 
gross tax losses of £260m (2022: £266m) due to the unpredictability of future profits. Included in this unrecognised amount are US 
state tax losses of £175m (2022: £178m) which can only be carried forward for between 15 and 20 years. These losses expire at various 
dates over the next 17 years. Other unrecognised losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

10. Dividends
Dividends are recognised on the date that the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established. Interim dividends are recognised 
when they become payable to Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by shareholders. The 
Board are proposing a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2023 of 4.2p per ordinary share. Subject to shareholder approval 
at the AGM, it will be paid on 16 May 2024 to holders of ordinary shares and ADS on the register as of 15 March 2024.

1  During 2022 and 2021, the Group declared and paid a series of dividends to GSK and Pfizer under the Shareholders’ Agreement valid at that time. The dividends per share for the 

dividends declared and paid before the demerger activities that took place in July 2022 were paid from the former ultimate holding company of CHHL2 and were calculated based 
on CHHL2’s share structure. In 2022, the Group utilised a £9,211m loan plus £37m of interest receivable from its former equity shareholders, prior to the demerger, to partially fund 
the pre-separation dividend and the final sweep dividend.

11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the Company’s weighted average number 
of share units in issue during the year after deducting treasury shares or shares held by employee benefit trusts (EBTs) if any. 

Basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2021 has been adjusted retrospectively, as required by IAS 33 ‘Earnings per 
share’, to reflect the share structure of the Company resulting from the increase in the number of ordinary shares outstanding as a result 
of the demerger activities that took place in July 2022. As a result, basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2021 has 
been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the Company’s weighted average number of shares in issue, 
with 9,234,573,831 shares outstanding upon the completion of the demerger activities. 

Diluted earnings per share has been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of shares used in the basic calculation 
to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares. There were no dilutive shares in 2021. 

The total number of shares held in connection with employee long-term incentive schemes as at 31 December 2023 was 10.4m. These 
were acquired for the purpose of meeting equity settled share-based payment obligations and are sufficient for the expected vesting 
in Q1 2024.

1  The total number of shares held as at 31 December 2023 was 10.4m. The impact of these shares on the basic weighted average number of shares was only 2m because these shares 

were acquired towards the end of the accounting period. These shares were acquired to meet the equity settled share-based payment obligations vesting in Q1 2024.

12. Property, plant and equipment
Land, buildings, plant, equipment and vehicles are valued at their cost, less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses.

Assets under construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment losses. Depreciation of these assets commences when 
the assets are ready for their intended use.

The cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in acquisition and installation of 
the assets.

Depreciation is recognised on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of the asset. Residual values and useful lives are 
reviewed, and where appropriate adjusted annually. Estimated useful lives of the major categories of assets are shown below:

Freehold buildings

20 to 50 years

Leasehold land and buildings

Lease term or 20 to 50 years

Plant and machinery

10 to 20 years

Equipment and vehicles

3 to 10 years

Property, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment if triggering events or circumstances indicate an impairment may 
exist. If an indication of impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash generating unit is estimated and any 
impairment loss is charged to the income statement as it arises. 

Where there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, 
the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 

On disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and impairments are derecognised from 
the Consolidated Financial Statements and the net amount, less any proceeds, is taken to the income statement.

No impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales for 2023 (2022: £nil, 2021: £2m), and £7m for 2023 (2022: £8m, 2021: £15m) 
has been charged to selling, general and administration. 

Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original 
impairments are deemed no longer to apply. No impairment reversals have been credited to cost of sales for 2023 (2022: £nil, 2021: £12m).

Reclassifications include £22m for 2023 (2022: £54m) related to assets under construction that have been reclassified to computer 
software in intangible assets during the year.

Impact of climate change 
Management undertook a modelling exercise to estimate the potential impact that extreme weather events could have on the Group’s 
manufacturing sites. Management considered that the hazards with the greatest potential impact over the long-term time horizon are 
riverine and flash flooding, and heatwaves. Given the geographical spread of the Group’s manufacturing sites, the prospect of every 
site being impacted in any given year, or for every year, is considered remote and as a result, the level of loss potentially arising would 
not be considered significant for the Group. In addition, the majority of the Group’s assets have useful lives that end ahead of the 
medium- to long-term timescales expected for extreme climate events to occur. Therefore, we consider that there is no material 
impairment risk on the property, plant, and equipment balances for the year as a result of climate change.

13. Right of use assets
When the Group leases an asset, a ‘right of use asset’ is recognised for the leased item and a lease liability is recognised for any lease 
payments to be paid over the lease term at the lease commencement date except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease 
term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (defined as assets with an initial fair value less than approximately £10,000). 

The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, being the present value of the lease payments paid or payable, plus any initial direct 
costs incurred in entering into the lease and less any lease incentives received. Non-lease components are accounted for separately 
from the lease components in plant and equipment leases but are not separately accounted for in land and buildings or vehicle leases. 

Right of use assets where title is expected to pass to the Group at a point in the future are depreciated in a manner consistent to that for 
owned property, plant and equipment. In other cases, right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset 
or the lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any periods for which the Group is ‘reasonably certain’ 
to exercise any extension options. If right of use assets are considered to be impaired, the carrying value is reduced accordingly. 

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the value of the lease payments over the lease term that are not paid at the commencement 
date and are usually discounted using the incremental borrowing rates of the applicable Group entity (the rate implicit in the lease is 
used if it is readily determinable). Lease payments included in the lease liability include both fixed payments and in-substance fixed 
payments during the term of the lease. 

After initial recognition, the lease liability is recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments or if the Group’s assessment of the lease term changes; any changes in the lease liability 
as a result of these changes also results in a corresponding change in the recorded right of use asset.

The total cash outflow for leases amounted to £55m in 2023 (2022: £45m, 2021: £38m). The Group has lease commitments relating 
to leases that have not commenced at year end of £1m (2022: £30m). Refer to Note 19 ‘Borrowings’ for further details on the Group’s 
lease liabilities.

14. Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the 
Group’s share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired subsidiaries at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not subject to 
amortisation but is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently where indicators of impairment exist and is carried at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. 

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped in cash generating units (CGUs). A CGU is identified as the lowest aggregation 
of assets that generate largely independent cash inflows, and which is looked at by management for monitoring and managing the business. 

If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset 
in the CGU. Any impairment loss is immediately recognised in the consolidated income statement and an impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not subsequently reversed. 

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 

Management uses the approved three-year strategic plan and the projected cash flows for a further two-year period as the basis for 
the Group CGUs value in use calculations.

On disposal, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.

Other intangibles
Intangible assets are recognised when they are identifiable, the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits 
attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. 

Separately purchased brands are initially measured at cost, being the purchase price as at the date of acquisition. Acquired brands are 
valued independently and recognised at fair value when the Group completes a business combination from third parties, where brands 
have a value which is substantial and long term and where the brands either are contractual or legal in nature or can be sold separately 
from the rest of the businesses acquired. The determination of the fair values of the separately identified intangibles is based, to a 
considerable extent, on management’s judgement. Brands are amortised over their estimated useful lives of up to 20 years, except where 
it is considered that the useful economic life is indefinite.

Indefinite life brands mainly comprise trademarks and brands for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are 
expected to generate net cash inflows. These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of the brands 
and the level of advertising and promotion support. These brands are in relatively similar, stable and profitable market sectors, with 
similar risk profiles, and their size, diversification and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in 
the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low. The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, 
economic or other factors which could limit their useful lives. Accordingly, they are not amortised.

Intangible assets are stated at cost less provisions for amortisation and impairments. Licences, patents, know-how and marketing rights 
separately acquired or acquired as part of a business combination are amortised over their estimated useful lives, generally not exceeding 
20 years, using the straight-line basis from the time they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for determining the amortisation 
charge consider patent lives, where applicable, as well as the value obtained from periods of non-exclusivity. Asset lives are reviewed 
and, where appropriate, adjusted annually.

Any development costs incurred by the Group and associated with acquired licences, patents, know-how or marketing rights are written 
off to the income statement when incurred. 

The costs of acquiring and developing computer software for internal use and internet sites for external use are capitalised as intangible 
fixed assets where the software or site supports a significant business system and the expenditure leads to the creation of an asset. 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems software is amortised over 7-10 years and other computer software over 3-5 years. 

The carrying values of all non-current assets are reviewed for impairment, either on a standalone basis or as part of a larger CGU, when 
there is an indication that the assets might be impaired. Additionally, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets 
which are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. Any provision for impairment is charged to the income statement. 
If the recoverable amount of an intangible is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Impairment losses are only reversed if there 
has been a change in estimates used to determine recoverable amounts and only to the extent that the revised recoverable amounts 
do not exceed the carrying values that would have existed, net of amortisation, had no impairments been recognised.

The net book value of computer software included £122m (2022: £133m) of internally generated costs. During the year ended 
31 December 2022, additions to indefinite life brands included £174m of non-cash purchases which were settled by offsetting a 
liability owed to the Group by GSK. 

In 2023, the Group completed the disposal of the rights in Lamisil, an amortised brand, for cash consideration of £235m. This resulted in 
a pre-tax loss on disposal of £10m. Lamisil was transferred to asset held for sale, and subsequently disposed of before the end of the year.

On 21 December 2023, the Group entered into a binding agreement for the sale of the ChapStick brand to Suave Brands Company, 
a portfolio company of Yellow Wood Partners. Under the terms of the transaction, the Group will receive pre-tax cash proceeds of 
approximately £337m ($430m), as well as a passive minority interest in the Suave Brands Company. Cash proceeds include approximately 
£16m ($20m) from the release of working capital allocated to ChapStick. At the time of entering into the binding agreement, the minority 
interest in the Suave Brands Company was valued at approximately £63m ($80m). 

The Group recognised an impairment of £170m in the income statement as the consideration received net of cost to sell was less than 
the carrying value of the brand. The Group has reclassified £377m of intangible asset after impairment and £16m of inventory relating 
to the brand as an asset held for sale. The divestment is consistent with the Group’s strategy of proactively managing its portfolio. 

Asset held for sale include the recoverable assets attributable to the ChapStick brand.

Goodwill impairment
Goodwill mainly arose from the Novartis Transaction in 2015 (£2.6bn) and the Pfizer Transaction in 2019 (£5.6bn).

Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs as follows:

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are assessed using a value in use model (2022: value in use). Value in use is calculated using a 
discounted cash flow approach, with a pre-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-adjusted pre-tax cash flows and terminal value. 

The discount rate used is based on the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the CGUs. The discount rates are specific to 
each CGU and are determined based on the cost of capital, including a market premium and country-specific political risk premiums.

Details relating to the discounted cash flow model used in the impairment tests of the APAC, EMEA & LatAm, and North America CGUs 
are as follows:

The terminal growth rate does not exceed the long-term projected growth rate for the Group. Goodwill is monitored for impairment 
at individual CGU level. In each case the valuation indicated substantial headroom such that it is remote that a reasonably possible 
change to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.

1  ChapStick has been classified as an asset held for sale as at 31 December 2023.

The Group tests all its indefinite life brands for impairment by applying a fair value less costs to sell model using a three-year strategic 
plan approved by management and cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the terminal growth rates. All 
brands were tested for impairment using brand-specific assumptions which included a discount rate equal to the Group’s post-tax 
WACC of 7.5% (2022: 7.0%; 2021: 6.0%) adjusted where appropriate for country and currency risks, and apply to the post-tax cash 
flows. This valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation 
technique is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition to the discount rate, the main assumptions include future sales 
price and volume growth, product contribution and the future expenditure required to maintain the product’s marketability and 
registration in the relevant jurisdictions. These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of management’s 
budgeting and strategic planning cycle. The terminal growth rates applied of between 0% and 3% (2022: 0% and 3%; 2021: -3% and 
3%) are management’s estimates which align with those of market participants’ estimate of future long-term average growth rates for 
the relevant markets. 

In 2023, the Group recorded a non-cash impairment charge of £170m upon signing a definitive agreement to dispose ChapStick, an 
indefinite life brand, which has been classified as an asset held for sale as at 31 December 2023. In addition, the Group also recorded 
an impairment of £15m relating to a collection of smaller brands as these brands are experiencing sales volume decline year on year.

Additionally, in 2023, the carry value of Preparation H continues to be sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. 
The post-tax discount rate used for the brand is 6.8% (2022: 6.75%) and terminal growth rate is 2.5% (2022: 2.5%). If the discount rate 
for Preparation H had been 0.5% higher or the terminal growth rate, had been 0.5% lower than management’s estimates respectively, 
the Group would have had to recognise an impairment of £115m or £75m, respectively.

Other than as disclosed above, management do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would 
cause the fair value less costs to sell of the individually significant brands disclosed above to fall below their carrying values. 

In 2022, the Group recorded an impairment charge of £111m for Preparation H since the carrying value of the brand was higher than 
the recoverable amount. The decrease in recoverable amount was mainly driven by an increase in the discount rate applied to the 
forecasted future cash flows from 6% to 6.75%. If the discount rate for Preparation H had been 0.25% higher or the revenue growth 
rate, including terminal growth rate, had been 0.25% lower than management’s estimates respectively, the Group would have had to 
recognise a further impairment of £70m or £75m respectively.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued

For Robitussin’s impairment testing in 2023, we have applied a post-tax discount rate of 6.5% (2022: 6.75%) and terminal growth rate 
of 2.5% (2022: 2.5%). Robitussin’s carrying value is no longer sensitive to any reasonably possible changes to key assumptions in 2023. 

Robitussin was sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions in 2021 and continued to be sensitive in 2022. Although 
the brand had recovered from the lower cold and flu incidence resulting from COVID-19 social distancing measures from previous 
years, the discount rate increased in 2022 causing the brand’s headroom to continue to be low at approximately 15% of its carrying 
value. The only reasonably possible change in key assumptions that would make the recoverable amount of Robitussin be equal or 
less than the carrying value would be to increase the discount rate of 6.75% by 0.6%. 

For 2021, the income statement charge for net impairment losses includes impairments of Zyrtec, Treely and capitalised costs for a 
discontinued research and development project, netted off by reversal of impairments in relation to Alvedon, Abreva and Solpadeine. 

Certain assets were transferred from intangible assets to assets held for sale and subsequently disposed of during the year.

Impact of climate change 
The Group has stress tested the future cash flows for the potential impact of climate change and concluded that there is sufficient 
headroom for goodwill. Preparation H’s recoverable amount is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would 
lead to an immaterial additional impairment charge due to either physical damage in our manufacturing sites or the associated costs 
of future transition risk. Carbon pricing is the highest potential transition risk that could have a medium risk in medium- to long-term 
time frame. With continued decarbonisation efforts and Haleon’s focus on meeting the targets to minimise carbon pricing impacts, 
this is not expected to have a material impact on the key assumptions used in the impairment assessment.

15. Inventories
Inventories are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements at the lower of cost (including raw materials, direct labour, other 
direct costs and related production overheads) and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make a sale.

The total cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales amounted to £4,196m in 2023 (2022: £3,970m, 
2021: £3,462m). This includes inventory write-down of £178m (2022: £118m, 2021: £174m). The Group reverses and reassesses its 
inventory provisions in full every reporting period.

The reversals of prior year write-downs of inventories in 2023 is £74m (2022: £40m, 2021: £63m) and these reversals principally arise 
from the reassessment of usage or demand expectations prior to inventory expiration.

Impact of climate change 
The Group’s inventory turnover cycle is much shorter than the longer-term time horizons associated with the climate-related risks and 
therefore the risk of material write-down of Haleon’s inventory is deemed to be low.

16. Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially measured at the original invoice amount and subsequently measured at amortised cost less allowances 
for expected credit losses which are measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. In determining credit risk, the Group 
considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue costs or effort. This includes both 
quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Group’s ageing of the receivables, customers’ payment history, and 
forward-looking information including wider macroeconomic factors. Trade receivables sold under a non-recourse factoring agreement 
are derecognised at the point of sale as risks and rewards are substantially transferred.

When a trade receivable is determined to have no reasonable expectation of recovery it is written off, firstly against any expected 
credit loss allowance available and then to the income statement. 

Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously provided for or written off are credited to the income statement. Long-term receivables 
are discounted where the effect is material.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and diverse. 
No single customer represents more than 10% of the Group’s sales. 

Within other third-party receivables, £230m (2022: £157m) was classified as financial assets. The expected credit loss in other 
receivables is not deemed significant, hence no credit loss allowance is recognised. Refer to Note 25 ‘Capital and financial risk 
management’ for further information on credit risk.

17. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash at bank and in hand and short-term highly liquid deposits which are primarily held for 
operating purposes with an original maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes.

Cash and cash equivalents include £50m in 2023 (2022: £78m) not available for general use due to restrictions applying in the 
subsidiaries where it is held. Restrictions include exchange controls and taxes on repatriation.

Customer return and rebate accruals are provided for by the Group at the point of sale in respect of the estimated rebates, discounts 
or allowances payable to customers. Accruals are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some 
time after the initial recognition of the sale. The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in light of historical experience of 
actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements. The assumptions used in estimation 
are based on known facts with a high level of accuracy. In addition, the Group’s promotional programmes are typically short-term in 
nature resulting in lower inherent estimation uncertainty. As a result, management considered no likelihood of material change in the 
next financial year.

Customer return and rebate accruals are not presented net against any trade receivables that may be owing from the same customer 
as the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 have not been met.

Refer to Note 24, ‘Related party transactions’ for further details on amounts payable to GSK and Pfizer.

The Group does not have significant financing arrangements for trade payables.

19. Borrowings
All borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with 
the difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount due on redemption being recognised as a charge to the 
income statement over the period of the relevant borrowing. 

Lease liabilities 
The corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a lease obligation within short-term and long-term borrowings. The carrying 
amount is subsequently increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced by lease payments made. 

For calculating the discounted lease liability on leases, the implicit rate in the lease is used. If this is not available, the incremental 
borrowing rate with a lease-specific adjustment is used. Finance costs are charged to the income statement to produce a constant 
periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligations for each accounting period. 

Variable rents are not part of the lease liability and the right of use asset. These payments are charged to the income statement as 
incurred. Short-term and low-value leases are not capitalised, and lease rentals are also charged to the income statement as incurred.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had within short-term borrowings, Pre-Separation USD Notes of $700m (£548m) (31 December 
2022: £nil). The average effective pre-swap interest rate of all short-term notes in issue as at 31 December 2023 was 3.02% 
(31 December 2022: nil).

The Group has access to a £2bn Euro commercial paper programme and a $10bn US Dollar commercial paper programme pursuant to 
which members of the Group may issue commercial paper from time to time. The weighted average interest rate on the commercial 
paper as at 31 December 2023 was nil (31 December 2022: 3.23%). 

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had short-term bank loans of £10m (31 December 2022: £18m). The weighted average interest rate 
on short-term bank loans as at 31 December 2023 was 7.8% (31 December 2022: 6.7%).

Long-term borrowings
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had within long-term borrowings, Euro Medium Term Notes and USD Notes of £8,686m 
(31 December 2022: £9,861m), of which £4,783 m (31 December 2022: £5,299m) will fall due in more than five years. The average 
effective pre-swap and post-swap interest rate of all long-term notes in issue as at 31 December 2023 was 3.0% and 3.6% respectively 
(31 December 2022: 3.1% and 3.2%). 

On 2 March 2023, the Group exercised its option to redeem at par the $300m of Callable Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2024 on 
24 March 2023. The carrying value of the bond was equal to the par value at the settlement date hence no gain or loss was recognised. 

On 17 July 2022, as part of the demerger activities, the Company issued 25,000,000 non-voting preference shares of £1.00 each to 
Pfizer Inc. with a coupon rate of 9.5% per annum. The non-voting preference shares (NVPS) command a mandatory quarterly coupon 
and can only be redeemed after a period of five years. The Group has, therefore, classified the non-voting preference shares as a 
financial liability. Pfizer Inc. has subsequently disposed of the NVPS to an external third party.

20. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group operates pension arrangements which cover the Group’s material obligations to provide pensions to retired employees. 
These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned. Pension benefits can be 
provided by state schemes, by defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising 
from contributions paid in respect of each employee, or by defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee 
pensionable remuneration and length of service. In certain countries, pension benefits are provided on an unfunded basis, some are 
administered by trustee companies. The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly post-employment healthcare 
plans in the US. These plans are predominantly unfunded. Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Group’s main plans are 
undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years. 

For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities 
is recognised as an asset or a liability on the consolidated balance sheet. Defined benefit plan liabilities are assessed using the projected 
unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date consistent with the advice of qualified 
actuaries. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The amount of any pension fund asset 
recognised on the balance sheet is limited to any future refunds from the plan or the present value of reductions in future 
contributions to the plan.

The amount charged to operating costs in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over 
the year, plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit changes, settlements, curtailments plus the finance charge for 
interest on net liability (such events are recognised immediately in the income statement). 

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (or asset) comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets 
excluding amounts included in net interest. Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. Actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising 
from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of 
interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income. 

The costs of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread over the 
period during which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees’ services. Future cash flows are discounted at rates reflecting 
the yields of high-quality corporate bonds. 

The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.

Discount rates are derived from AA-rated corporate bond yields, except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate 
bonds, government bond yields are used instead. Discount rates are selected to reflect the term of the expected benefit payments. 
Projected inflation rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and 
fixed-interest government bonds, where available, or on long-term inflation forecasts. 

For the year ended 31 December 2021, GSK operated certain pension schemes in which the Group’s UK and US employees participated. 
These schemes included defined benefit arrangements where the assets were held independently of the Group’s finances and which were 
funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from GSK at rates advised by independent qualified actuaries. 

Before the demerger from GSK in July 2022, it was announced that GSK’s UK defined benefit plans and US cash balance pension plans 
were closed to future accruals and GSK would continue to maintain the plans only for existing participants. GSK charged the Group 
a management fee relating to the pension arrangements for the Group’s UK and US employees calculated as if the arrangements were 
on a defined contribution basis. The costs of such defined contribution arrangements were not included with the pension charge. 
This arrangement is not in practice post demerger.

Following the demerger from GSK, the Group operates its own defined contribution pension schemes for the Group’s UK and US employees.

In addition, there are a number of post-employment healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the US.

Balance sheet
The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specific assets or as a proportion of a 
general fund or are insurance contracts. Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return. 
Investments are diversified to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment. 

The pension plans are exposed to risk that arises because the estimated market value of the plans’ assets might decline, the investment 
returns might reduce, or the estimated value of the plans’ liabilities might increase. 

Long-term investment strategies for the plans, with investments across a broad range of assets, have been agreed with the trustees to 
include return-seeking assets to generate future returns and liability-matching assets to better match future pension obligations. The 
main market risks within the asset portfolio are credit risk, interest rates, long-term inflation, equities and property risk.

The plan liabilities are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration. On an IAS 19 basis, these cash flows are sensitive to 
changes in the expected long-term inflation rate and the discount rate (AA corporate bond yield curve) where an increase in long-term 
inflation corresponds with an increase in the liabilities, and an increase in the discount rate corresponds with a decrease in the liabilities.

21. Provisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date, as a result of a past event, where 
the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable. 

Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the most likely outcome of the expenditure required to settle the obligation 
at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Provisions are classified as non-current where 
the exact timing of settlement is uncertain but they are expected to be settled in more than 12 months.

Other provisions include employee-related, legal, environmental, and other provisions. Refer to Note 6, ‘Operating profit’ for further 
details about the Group’s restructuring costs.

22. Contingent liabilities and commitments
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows where the likelihood of payment is considered more than remote, but is not 
considered probable or cannot be measured reliably. No provision is made for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they 
will result in an obligation in the future.

At 31 December 2023, contingent liabilities, comprising guarantees and other items arising in the normal course of business, amounted 
to £29m (2022: £30m).

The Group is involved in significant legal and administrative proceedings, principally relating to product liabilities. The most significant 
of these matters, other than tax matters, are described herein. Provision is made for the outcome of tax, legal and other disputes 
where it is both probable that the Group will suffer an outflow of funds and it is possible to make a reliable estimate of that outflow.

Legal proceedings
The Group may become involved in legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to determine whether a potential outflow 
is probable, or to make a reliable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that could result from the proceedings. In these 
cases, appropriate disclosure about such cases would be included but no provision would be made. Costs associated with claims 
made by the Group against third parties are charged to the income statement as they are incurred.

The Group makes provision for these proceedings on a regular basis as summarised in the accounting policy above.

152

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Financial Statements

Financial Statements

With respect to each of the legal proceedings described below, other than those for which a provision has been made, the Group is 
unable to make a reliable estimate of the expected financial effect at this stage. The Group does not believe that information about 
the amount sought by the plaintiffs, if that is known, would be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. This is due to a 
number of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage of proceedings, the entitlement of parties to appeal a decision and clarity 
as to theories of liability, damages and governing law.

The Group’s position could change over time, and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome 
of any legal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount the value of the provisions reported in the Group’s financial statements. 
If this were to happen, it could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the Group in the reporting period in 
which the judgements are incurred or the settlements entered into.

Zantac litigation
GSK and/or Pfizer have been named as defendants (alongside other manufacturers of ranitidine, as well as retailers and distributors) 
in personal injury lawsuits, as well as economic injury and medical monitoring class actions, filed in the US involving Zantac. The Group 
understands that outside the US, there are class actions and individual actions pending against GSK and Pfizer in Canada, along with 
a class action against GSK in Israel.

The Group is not a party to any Zantac claims and the Group has never marketed Zantac in any form in the US or Canada. The Group is 
not primarily liable for any OTC or prescription Zantac claims.

The Group has received notices of potential claims for indemnification relating to OTC Zantac arising out of the Stock and Asset 
Purchase Agreement (SAPA), which the Group has rejected on the basis that the scope of the indemnities set out in the SAPA only 
covers the Consumer Healthcare businesses of GSK and Pfizer as conducted when their Consumer Healthcare joint venture was 
formed in 2018. At that time, neither GSK nor Pfizer marketed OTC Zantac in the US or Canada.

Proton pump inhibitor litigation
The Group is a defendant in the ongoing proton pump inhibitor (PPI) litigation, in which plaintiffs allege that their use of PPIs caused 
serious bodily injuries, predominantly kidney-related injuries. 

The Group reached a settlement agreement with plaintiffs’ counsel to resolve the vast majority of PPI cases (Nexium24HR and 
Prevacid24HR) pending against the Group. The financial impact was recognised in the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements for 
2022, and is not material to the Group’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

German competition litigation
In 2013, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare GmbH & Co. KG and other members of a working group of a German trademark 
association were fined by the Federal Cartel Office of Germany as a result of the exchange of certain information related to retailers 
during meetings from 2004 to 2006.

Following the fine imposed by the Federal Cartel Office in 2013, the Group is party to civil proceedings in Germany brought by or on 
behalf of retailers against the Group and other manufacturers of branded drugstore products, alleging that the exchange of information 
within the working group led to higher purchase prices being paid by the retailers, and claiming that the Group and other working 
group members are jointly and severally liable for potential damages. The proceedings are taking place in different courts across 
Germany and are at different stages.

Commitments
Commitments are contractual obligations to acquire certain classes of assets in the future. These amounts are not recorded in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

23. Share capital, share premium and other reserves
Share capital represents the par value of shares that have been issued.

Share premium includes any premiums received on the issue of share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of 
shares are deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.

Other reserves include the following: 

 — EBT shares reserve comprise shares held by an employee benefit trust in connection with the Group’s share-based incentive plans.
 — Cash flow hedge reserve comprises gains and losses relating to these types of financial instruments. 
 — Merger reserve arises as a result of business combinations of entities under common control.
 — Other reserves comprise mainly differences between the fair value of the consideration paid for an investment, and the carrying 

value of assets and liabilities acquired from business combinations under common control.

Translation reserve arises from the foreign currency translation of the Group’s foreign operations into the Group’s presentation currency.

Retained earnings includes all current and prior years’ retained profits, remeasurement gains/(losses), including any tax impacts on 
defined benefit plans.

24. Related party transactions
A related party under IFRS is a person or entity that is related to the Group. These include both people and entities that have, or are 
subject to, influence or control over the Group.

Related parties
Upon the completion of the demerger on 18 July 2022, GSK ceased to be a related party of the Group under IAS 24, ‘Related 
Party Disclosures’. 

There were no significant transactions with Pfizer for the year ended 31 December 2023. The Group undertook significant transactions 
with entities from within GSK during the period ended 18 July 2022, and the year ended 31 December 2021 and with entities from 
within Pfizer for the years ended 31 December 2022 and 2021.

The Group had transactions with related parties under manufacture and supply agreements, distribution agreements, support service 
agreements, provision of research and development, toll-manufacturing services and transitional services agreements. In addition, the 
Group earned net interest income resulting from funds on-lent to GSK and Pfizer. All related party transactions are undertaken at arm’s 
length in accordance with the Group transfer pricing policy.

Where the legal completion of local transfer of assets and liabilities has been delayed, but the Group is able to exercise control over 
the relevant activities, the relevant net assets and profits have been recognised in the results.

Pre demerger, the Group had a £9,211m loan receivable from GSK/Pfizer together with £37m accrued interest receivable. This loan was 
primarily funded by proceeds from the bond offerings during the first half of 2022 (refer to Note 19 ‘Borrowings’). The loan receivable 
and interest accrued were exchanged to partially settle the £11,930m of pre-demerger dividend.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued

As at 31 December 2023, other amounts owing from GSK of £32m (2022: £51m) comprise balances arising from arrangements set up 
with GSK before the demerger activities. Since these balances occurred when GSK was still a related party of the Group, they are 
disclosed in the table above. 

As at 31 December 2021, the loan amounts owing from related parties of £1,508m were held with GSK finance companies as part of 
the Group’s banking arrangements received at the new risk-free benchmark rate -0.05% and were repayable on demand.

As at 31 December 2021, the loan amounts owing to related parties of £825m were held with GSK finance companies as part of the 
Group’s banking arrangements. These balances were unsecured with interest largely paid at the new risk free benchmark rate +0.10% 
and were repayable on demand.

25. Capital and financial risk management
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL). The measurement basis is determined by reference to both the business model for managing the financial asset and 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. For financial assets other than trade receivables, a 12-month expected 
credit loss allowance is recorded on initial recognition. If there is subsequent evidence of a significant increase in the credit risk of an 
asset, the allowance is increased to reflect the full lifetime expected credit loss. If there is no realistic prospect of recovery, the asset 
is written off.

Derivatives and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. The principal derivative instruments used by the Group 
are forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps. 

Derivative financial instruments are classified as held-for-trading and are measured at fair value. Derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments are classified on inception as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. The treatment of changes in 
the value of derivatives depends on their use as explained below. 

Fair value hedges 
Certain derivatives are held to hedge the risk of changes in value of a specific bond or other loan. In these situations, the Group designates 
the liability and related derivative to be part of a fair value hedge relationship. The carrying value of the bond is adjusted by the fair 
value of the risk being hedged, with changes going to the income statement. Gains and losses on the corresponding derivative are also 
recognised in the income statement. The amounts recognised are offset in the income statement to the extent that the hedge is effective. 
Ineffectiveness may occur if the critical terms do not exactly match, or if there is a value adjustment resulting from a change in credit 
risk (in either the Group or the counterparty to the derivative) that is not matched by the hedged item. When the relationship no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value hedge adjustment made to the bond is amortised to the income statement using 
the effective interest method. 

Cash flow hedges 
Derivatives are also held to hedge the uncertainty in timing or amount of future forecast cash flows. Such derivatives are designated as 
being part of cash flow hedge relationships. For an effective hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives are 
recognised in equity. Any ineffective elements of the hedge are recognised in the income statement. Ineffectiveness may occur if there 
are changes to the expected timing of the hedged transaction. If the hedged cash flow relates to a non-financial asset, the amount 
accumulated in equity is subsequently included within the carrying value of that asset. For other cash flow hedges, amounts deferred 
in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the related cash flow. When a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity until the related cash flow occurs. When the cash flow takes place, the cumulative 
gain or loss is taken to the income statement. If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss is taken 
to the income statement immediately.

Net investment hedges 
Certain derivatives and financial liabilities are designated as hedges of the currency risk on the Group’s investment in foreign 
subsidiaries. Differences arising on retranslation of a financial liability designated as a foreign currency net investment hedge and 
the fair value of derivatives are recorded in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. These differences on retranslation and 
the fair value of derivatives are reported within the income statement to the extent that the hedge is ineffective. Gains and losses 
accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of. 

Derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied
Derivatives not designated as hedges are held in order to hedge certain balance sheet items and commodity exposures. No hedge 
accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being recognised in the income statement.

Risk management
The key objectives of the Group’s treasury activities are to minimise the net cost of financial operations and reduce volatility arising 
from financial risks. 

Treasury activities are governed by the Board. The Group has a Treasury Risk Committee (TRC), chaired by the CFO, that meets on 
a regular basis to review treasury activities. The TRC’s members receive management information relating to treasury activities.

Financial Statements

The Group may use a variety of financial instruments to finance its operations and derivative financial instruments to manage market 
risks from these operations. Derivatives principally comprise of foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps which are used to 
manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk on borrowings. 

Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes in relation to underlying business activities and not as trading or 
speculative instruments.

Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group are able to operate as going concerns whilst availing themselves 
of intercompany funding where appropriate.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s long-term credit rating with S&P Global Ratings (S&P) is BBB (stable outlook) (2022: BBB) and with 
Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) it is Baa1 (stable outlook) (2022: Baa1). The Group’s short-term credit ratings are A-2 and P-2 with 
S&P and Moody’s, respectively (2022: A-2 and P-2 respectively).

Liquidity risk management 
The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally in order to meet anticipated funding requirements. The strategy is to diversify liquidity sources 
and to maintain broad access to financial markets. Each day, the Group sweeps cash to or from a number of global subsidiaries and 
central treasury accounts for liquidity management purposes.

The Group uses both notional and physical cash pool arrangements as appropriate by location and currency. For notional cash pools, 
liquidity is drawn against foreign currency balances to provide both local funding and central liquidity as required and with balances 
actively managed and maintained to appropriate levels. As balances in notional pooling arrangements are not settled across currencies, 
gross cash and overdraft balances are reported. At 31 December 2023, the Group had £656m (2022: £437m) of borrowings repayable 
within one year and held £1,044m (2022: £684m) of cash and cash equivalents. 

The Group uses short-term financing to manage working capital requirements and has access to a $10,000m US commercial paper 
programme and a £2,000m Euro commercial paper programme, both of which were established in August 2022. At 31 December 2023, 
the Group had nil (2022: $225m) of US commercial paper in issue and nil (2022: €130m) of Euro commercial paper in issue. 

The Group has access to two revolving credit facilities: a $1,300m facility maturing in September 2024; and a £900m facility maturing 
in September 2026 with a one-year extension option. These committed facilities were undrawn at 31 December 2023.

Long-term financing consists of $8,448m in USD bonds, as well as €2,350m Euro bonds and £700m GBP bonds issued under a 
£10,000m Euro Medium Term Note programme. Refer to Note 19 ‘Borrowings’ for further details about the Group’s bonds.

Foreign exchange risk management
Foreign currency transaction exposures arising on internal and external trade flows are selectively hedged. The Group’s objective is 
to minimise the exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk by matching local currency income with local currency 
costs where possible. Foreign currency cash flows may be hedged selectively as approved by the TRC. Cash surpluses or borrowing 
requirements of subsidiary companies are usually managed centrally using foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps to hedge 
future repayments back into the originating currency.

Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies that match investments in overseas Group assets may be treated as 
a hedge against the relevant assets. Forward contracts in major currencies are also used to reduce exposure to the Group’s investment 
in overseas assets. Refer to ‘Net investment hedges’ section of this Note for further details.

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group, and arises 
on cash and cash equivalents and favourable derivative financial instruments held with banks and financial institutions as well as 
credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables.

The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be £2,777m (2022: £2,441m) which is the total of the Group’s financial assets, excluding 
other investments which bear equity risk rather than credit risk.

The Group’s greatest concentration of credit risk at 31 December 2023 is £342m with HSBC (A-/A3), and £158m with Citigroup Inc. 
(BBB+/A3). The Group’s greatest concentration of credit risk at 31 December 2022 was £310m with HSBC (A-/A3), and £158m with 
Citigroup Inc. (BBB+/A3).

There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the current reporting period in assessing 
the loss allowance for financial assets at amortised cost since the adoption of IFRS 9.

Treasury-related credit risk
The Group has continued to maintain a consistent approach to counterparty risk throughout the year. The aggregate credit risk in respect 
of financial instruments that the Group may have with one counterparty is limited by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned 
for that counterparty by a recognised credit rating agency (e.g., S&P or Moody’s.) The Group measures expected credit losses over 
cash and cash equivalents as a function of individual counterparty credit ratings and associated 12-month default rates. Based on the 
available credit ratings, the credit risk of outstanding financial instruments has not increased significantly since their initial recognition. 
Expected credit losses over cash and cash equivalents and third-party financial derivatives are deemed to be immaterial and so have 
not been recognised. No such loss has been experienced during 2023 and 2022. The credit ratings of counterparties are set out in the 
below table.

The credit ratings in the above tables are as assigned by S&P and Moody’s. Where the opinion of the two rating agencies differs, the 
lower rating of the two is assigned to the counterparty. Where local rating or Fitch data is the only source available, the ratings are 
converted to global ratings equivalent to those of S&P or Moody’s using published conversion tables.

Wholesale and retail credit risk
The Group does not have a substantial wholesale and retail credit risk as a result of its diversified geographical presence, product 
offering, consumer profile, and historical credit loss information. Where appropriate, the Group utilises credit insurance and receivables 
factoring to minimise the credit risk of the trade receivables in the Group (refer to Note 16 ‘Trade and other receivables’ for further 
details about the Group’s expected credit losses). Factoring arrangements are based on a portfolio approach and are used to mitigate 
risk arising from large credit risk concentrations. All factoring arrangements are non-recourse.

Interest rate risk management
The Group manages the interest rate risk on its net debt portfolio, with the objectives of minimising the effective net interest cost and 
income statement volatility. 

The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from borrowings and investments with floating rates and from the refinancing of maturing 
fixed-rate debt where any changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows. The policy on interest rate risk management limits the 
net amount of floating-rate debt to a specific cap.

77% of the Group’s debt was held at fixed rates as at 31 December 2023 (2022: 87%), including the impact of swaps. Any bond debt 
with less than three months to maturity is considered floating rate.

Interest rate and forward starting interest rate swaps
The forward starting interest rate contracts, exchanging floating interest for fixed interest, were designated as cash flow hedges to 
hedge the interest variability of the interest cash flows associated with the future fixed-rate debt.

The interest rate swap contracts, exchanging fixed interest rate for floating interest, have been designated as fair value hedges to 
hedge the variability in fair value associated with the Group’s fixed-rate debt. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on 
the loan occur simultaneously and the fair value of interest rate swaps and the fair value of related debt affect the income statement 
at the same time.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are used to mitigate exposure to foreign exchange transactional risks of the Group. The fair value of 
a derivative financial instrument is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity is more than 12 months and as 
a current asset or liability if the maturity is less than 12 months. All foreign exchange contracts are for periods of 12 months or less.

The Group has the following derivative financial instruments:

Fair value hedges — interest rate swap contracts

Net investment hedges — cross currency interest rate swaps

Fair value hedges
At issuance in March 2022, $1,750m and €850m bonds were converted from fixed rate to floating rate using interest rate swaps as 
shown in the above table. These bonds and swaps were designated in fair value hedges. 

Cash flow hedges
In 2022, the Group entered into forward starting interest rate swaps (derivatives) to pre-hedge interest rate risk on the fixed rate 
bonds issued in March 2022. These derivatives were designated in a cash flow hedge relationship. The derivatives were settled in 
March 2022 and as a result cash flow hedges were terminated with a net cash inflow of £206m. The element of gains/losses of these 
cash flow hedges relating to other comprehensive income is being amortised to the income statement as per the maturity profile of 
the loan notes.

In 2023, the Group established a programme of hedging highly probable forecast transactional foreign exchange exposure using 
foreign exchange contracts (FX forwards and FX swaps). The key exposure designated under cash flow hedge accounting are forecast 
receipts from customers and payments to suppliers, capital expenditure and other administration expenses payable in foreign currency.

Net investment hedges 
At 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, certain foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps were 
designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Group’s net 
investment in its European (Euro) and Chinese (CNY) foreign operations as shown in the table above.

The carrying value of the EUR bonds in Note 19 ‘Borrowings’ included £1,503m (2022: £1,526m) that were also designated as hedging 
instruments in net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Group’s net 
investment in its European (Euro) foreign operations. For net investment hedges, the balance in the foreign currency translation reserve 
in relation to continuing hedges is £(77)m (2022: £140m).

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities excluding lease liabilities
The table on the next page presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. The fair 
values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: 

 — Cash and cash equivalents carried at amortised cost, trade and other receivables and certain other non-current assets, loans amounts 
owing from/(to) related parties, trade and other payables and certain other non-current liabilities: approximates to the carrying amount.

 — Cash and cash equivalents (money market funds) carried at fair value: based on net asset value of the funds.
 — Short-term loans, overdrafts and commercial paper: approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of 

these instruments.

 — Interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts: based on present value of contractual cash flows using market-sourced data 

(exchange rates and interest rates) at the balance sheet date.

 — Long-term loans: based on executable quotes or thinly traded prices (a level 2 fair value measurement) for European and US Medium 
Term Notes; based on present value of contractual cash flows for non-voting preference shares and based on the approximation of 
the carrying amount in the case of other floating-rate bank loans.

Financial instruments held at fair value shown according to the fair value hierarchy is provided below. Financial assets and liabilities 
held at fair value are categorised by the valuation methodology applied in determining their fair value. Where possible, quoted prices 
in active markets are used (level 1). Where such prices are not available, the asset or liability is classified as level 2, provided all 
significant inputs to the valuation model used are based on observable market data. If one or more of the significant inputs to the 
valuation model is not based on observable market data, the instrument is classified as level 3.

Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
There are also arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting but still allow for the related amounts to be offset in certain 
circumstances, such as bankruptcy or the termination of a contract.

The following tables set out the financial assets and liabilities that are offset, or subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and 
other similar agreements but not offset, as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022. The column ‘Net amount’ shows the impact on 
the Group’s balance sheet if all offset rights were exercised.

Amounts which do not meet the criteria for offsetting on the balance sheet but could be settled net in certain circumstances principally 
relate to derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements where each party has the 
option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party. As there is presently not a legally enforceable right 
of offset, these amounts have not been offset in the balance sheet but have been presented separately in the tables above.

Sensitivity analysis
Foreign exchange sensitivity
The two major foreign currencies in which the Group’s financial instruments are denominated are US Dollars and Euros. Financial 
instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that 
holds them. Intercompany loans which are fully hedged to maturity with a currency swap have been excluded from this analysis.

Interest rate sensitivity
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments where any changes in interest rates will affect 
future cash flows or the fair values of financial instruments. The table below shows the Group’s hypothetical sensitivity to changes in 
interest rates in relation to Pound Sterling, US Dollar and Euro variable rate financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives. If the 
interest rates applicable to floating-rate financial assets and liabilities were to have increased by 1% (100 basis points), and assuming 
other variables had remained constant, it is estimated that the Group’s finance income for 2023 would have decreased by approximately 
£47m (2022: decreased by approximately £45m). A 1% (100 basis points) movement in US Dollar interest rates would not have any 
impact to equity (2022: no impact to equity). A 1% (100 basis points) movement in interest rates in relation to Pound Sterling or Euro is 
not deemed to have a material effect on equity (2022: not deemed to have a material effect on equity).

The following table provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows including interest payable for the Group’s borrowings 
on an undiscounted basis. Interest is calculated based on debt held at the balance sheet date without taking account of future issuance. 
Floating-rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date. Cash flows in foreign currencies are 
translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.

26. Employee share schemes
Incentives in the form of share awards are provided to employees under share schemes. The fair value of equity-settled share schemes 
is calculated at the grant date using a fair value model and is charged to the income statement over the vesting period with 
a corresponding adjustment to the equity share-based payment reserve. At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews its 
charge and revises it accordingly based on the number of shares expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, 
if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate.

For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of service rendered is based on the fair value of the liability related to the 
share-based instrument granted.

Description of the Group’s plans
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes for Executive Directors and other employees which are predominantly 
equity-settled, however may be cash-settled in certain locations. 

Performance Share Plan
Under the Performance Share Plan, awards are granted to Executive Directors and other employees over ordinary shares or ADS in 
Haleon plc at no cost. The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a defined measurement 
period with dividends reinvested during the same period. The performance conditions attached to each award are based on two measures 
over a three-year performance period. These are currently cumulative free cash flow (50%) and the ratio of net debt/adjusted EBITDA 
(50%). In addition, an environmental, social and governance (ESG) qualifier applies which can reduce the level of the overall vesting by 
up to 75%. The fair value of the awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant. Starting from 2024, the 
performance conditions are planned to be cumulative free cash flow (50%), adjusted diluted EPS (30%) and organic operating margin 
improvement (20%) with the ESG qualifier working the same way.

Share Value Plan
Under the Share Value Plan, awards are granted to qualifying employees over ordinary shares or ADS in Haleon plc at no cost. These 
awards generally vest after three years and there are normally no performance conditions attached. The fair value of these awards is 
determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant and adjusted for the expected dividend yield of 1.54% (2022: 1.59%) 
during the vesting period. 

Share Save and Share Reward Plans
The Share Save and Share Reward Plans are HMRC-approved savings-related plans. These plans are made available to all UK employees.

The Share Save Plan enables participants to save up to £500 per month, over a fixed three-year period. At the end of the fixed period 
the savings can be used to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at a predetermined discount of up to 20%, which is set at the time 
of each Share Save launch. 

Participants of the Share Reward Plan contribute up to £125 per month to purchase Haleon plc ordinary shares. The Company 
then matches these purchases on a one-for-one basis. Participants are eligible to receive dividends during the holding period either 
as cash or reinvested to buy further shares. The shares are placed in a UK resident trust and are available to the individual with tax 
advantages after a five-year period.

Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DABP)
Executive Directors are required to defer 50% of any bonus earned into an award over ordinary shares or ADS under the DABP, which 
will normally vest on the third anniversary of grant, subject to continued employment. DABP awards are eligible for dividend equivalent 
payments in respect of dividends that would have been paid on the ordinary shares or ADS up to the date the awards vest.

Legacy GSK share plans
Incentives in the form of shares in the Group’s equity shareholder, GSK plc, were provided to employees under share award schemes 
until the demerger date. The share-based compensation charge for these schemes has been recorded in the income statement as 
selling, general and administration (2022: £61m, 2021: £59m). This expense was incurred in the form of a charge from GlaxoSmithKline 
Services Unlimited, as calculated under IFRS 2. The share-based payment schemes that were operated prior to demerger have vested 
early with all Haleon participants treated as good leavers.

Haleon has also issued Deferred Investment Awards, representing the conversion of legacy GSK awards subsequently issued in 
Haleon plc ordinary shares. This is a cash-settled share-based payment transaction.

For the purposes of valuing options in relation to the Share Save Plan to arrive at the share-based payment charge, a Black-Scholes 
option pricing model has been used. The assumptions used in the model are as follows:

Weighted average fair value at the measurement date (£)

Risk-free interest rate (%)

Expected dividend yield (%)

Volatility (%)

Expected life (years) 

Share Save Plan-related options grant price (including 20% discount) (£)

2023 Grant

23.63

3.5

£2.66 

0.89

3.54

1.59

31.37

3

£2.27 

The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the share options is 
indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

At 31 December 2023, the range of exercise prices on options outstanding were between £2.27 and £2.66 (2022: £2.27) with remaining 
weighted average contractual life of 2.3 years (2022: 3.0 years). The weighted average market price on exercise during the year was £3.28.

There has been no change in the effective exercise price of any outstanding options during the year. 

Employee benefit trusts
The Group sponsors employee benefit trusts (EBTs) to acquire and hold shares in Haleon plc to satisfy awards made under employee 
share plans. The trustees of the EBTs purchase shares with finance provided by the Group by way of gifts or loans. The costs of running 
the EBTs are charged to the income statement. Shares held by the EBTs are deducted from other reserves and amortised down to the 
value of proceeds, if any, receivable from other subsidiaries on exercise by a transfer to retained earnings. The trustees have waived 
their rights to dividends on the shares held by the EBTs. At 31 December 2023, the EBTs held 10.4m shares (2022: 0.2m shares) with a 
market value of £34m (2022: £1m). 

27. Business acquisitions and disposals
Business combinations where common control exists at the time of the transaction are accounted for by adopting the principles of 
predecessor accounting. Such business combinations are accounted for by recognising all assets and liabilities acquired at their previous 
carrying values with effect from the beginning of the earliest period reported in the financial statements. No new goodwill arises from 
such transactions and the differences between the fair value of the consideration paid and the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
acquired is recorded within equity in the merger reserve.

Business combinations where common control does not exist before the transaction are accounted for using the acquisition accounting 
method. Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are measured at fair value at acquisition date. The consideration 
transferred is measured at fair value and includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Where the consideration transferred, 
together with the non-controlling interest, exceeds the fair value of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the excess 
is recorded as goodwill, denominated in the currency of the operation acquired. 

The costs related to business combinations are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Where not all 
the equity of a subsidiary is acquired, the non-controlling interest is recognised either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
share of the net assets of the subsidiary, on a case-by-case basis.

Disposal groups are generally measured at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Any gain or loss resulting 
from the disposal is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Changes in the Group’s ownership percentage of subsidiaries are accounted for within equity.

Acquisitions
On 28 April 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of the Jacarepaguá (Brazil) manufacturing site from GSK for a final consideration 
of £70m (BRL 434m) as a part of the demerger which has been accounted for as business combination. The fair value of the assets and 
liabilities recorded has been finalised in the year ending 31 December 2023 which resulted in the recognition of a bargain purchase 
gain of £7m. The gain from bargain purchase is a result of an increase in the fair value of identified assets during the period prior to 
the closing date.

28. Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests comprises equity interests in entities not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The Group’s 
non-controlling interests are individually not material.

29. Post balance sheet events
On 29 February 2024 the Board proposed a final dividend of 4.2 pence per ordinary share for a total amount of £388m. Subject to 
shareholder approval at the Company’s AGM, this dividend will be paid on 16 May 2024 to holders of ordinary shares and ADRs on 
the register as of 15 March 2024. The dividend will be paid out of retained profits.

30. Subsidiaries
Accounting policy
A subsidiary is an entity directly or indirectly controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has existing rights 
that give it the current ability to direct the activities that affect the Company’s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from 
the entity.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to 
the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the Group. All intra-group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of 
consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount 
of those interests at the date of the original acquisition and the non-controlling shareholder’s share of changes in equity since the 
date of the acquisition. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the 
non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

No subsidiaries are excluded from the Group consolidation.

Notes to the Parent Company  
Financial Statements

1. Presentation of the Financial Statements
Description of business
Haleon plc and its subsidiary undertakings (collectively, the Group) is a group of companies focused on developing and marketing a 
range of Oral Health, Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements (VMS), Pain Relief, Respiratory Health, Digestive Health and Other products 
in more than 100 countries.

The principal activity of the Company is to act as the parent holding company of the Group.

The Company is a public company limited by shares and is incorporated and domiciled in England with registered number 13691224.
The address of the Company’s registered office is Building 5, First Floor, The Heights, Weybridge, Surrey, England, KT13 0NY.

In 2022, the Company’s accounting reference period was extended to 31 December 2022 and hence comparatives cover the period from 
20 October 2021 to 31 December 2022.

Basis of preparation
The Parent Company Financial Statements, which are prepared using the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis, are 
prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of 
Ireland’ and the Companies Act 2006. 

The Parent Company Financial Statements are presented in Pound Sterling (GBP, £), the functional currency of the Company, and all 
values are denominated in millions of GBP (£m or £ million) unless stated otherwise.

As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Company is not presented in this Annual Report. 

In these Parent Company Financial Statements, the Company is considered to be a qualifying entity (for the purposes of this FRS) and 
has applied the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of the following disclosures:

 — The requirements of Section 7 Statement of Cash Flows.
 — The requirements of Section 3 Financial Statement Presentation paragraph 3.17(d).
 — The requirements of Section 33 Related Party Disclosures.
 — The requirements of Section 11 Financial Instruments.
 — The requirements of Section 12 Other Financial Instruments.
 — The requirements of Section 28 to disclose information about Key Management Personnel compensation.
 — The requirements of Section 26 Share Based Payments.

Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group.

Going concern basis
The Company operates as the investment holding company for the Group, holding investments in subsidiaries financed by Group 
companies and occasionally acting as financial guarantor of certain subsidiaries of the Group. As the Company is an intrinsic part of the 
Group’s structure and considering the likelihood of the guarantees being called upon, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
Group companies will continue to support the Company through trading and cash generated from trading for the foreseeable future.

Accounting principles and policies
The preparation of the balance sheet in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at the date of the balance sheet. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

The balance sheet has been prepared in accordance with the Company’s accounting policies approved by the Board and described 
in Note 2.

Key accounting judgements and estimates
There are no key judgements or significant estimates.

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Financial Statements

Financial Statements

2. Accounting policies
The accounting policies below have been applied throughout the Parent Company Financial Statements and apply to the Parent Company 
Financial Statements as a whole.

Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency assets and liabilities 
are translated at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 

Operating income and expenditure
Income and expenditure are recognised in respect of services provided or received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms. 
An accrual is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can 
be reliably estimated.

Interest receivable and interest payable
Interest receivable and similar income includes interest receivable on intercompany loans. Interest payable and similar charges includes 
interest payable on intercompany loans. Interest receivable and interest payable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue, using 
the effective interest rate method.

Dividends
Dividends received are included in the profit and loss account in the year in which the right to receive the payment is established. Final 
dividends are recorded in the reserves upon shareholder approval. Interim dividends are deducted from reserves when they are paid. 
Dividends in the statement of changes in equity are recognised at their fair value at the date of receipt.

Taxation
Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or refunded applying tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. This takes into account taxation deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of 
certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at 
the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax 
in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are considered 
recoverable against future taxable profits and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.

Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not discounted.

The Company has applied the exception under the FRS 102 amendment for recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax 
assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

The carrying value of investments are reviewed for impairment at least once a year or more frequently when there is an indication that 
the investment might be impaired. The primary method used to assess if the investment is impaired is to evaluate against the Group’s 
valuation on the basis of overall market capitalisation. Another assessment method used is to compare the carrying value of each 
investment against its share of the net assets value of the investment or against its share of the valuation of the subsidiary based on 
expected discounted cash flows. Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in the year concerned.

Share-based payments
Incentives in the form of equity-settled share-based payments are provided to certain employees which are measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate 
of the shares that will eventually vest, adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.

Incentives in the form of shares provided by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions. 
An addition to the Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings is reported with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity. 
Refer to Note 26 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the charge.

The Company sponsors Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) to acquire and hold shares in Haleon plc to satisfy awards made under 
employee share plans. Shares in the Company acquired by the trust are deducted from equity until shares are vested, cancelled, 
reissued or disposed.

Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be party to such provisions. Financial liabilities are classified as 
current if they are legally due to be paid within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

181

Notes to the Parent Company  
Financial Statements continued

Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently reported at amortised cost.

Receivables are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any 
expected credit losses.

Amounts owed to Group undertakings and other payables are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Non-interest bearing payables are stated at their nominal value as they are due 
on demand.

Non-current liabilities are classified as financial liabilities in accordance with IFRS 9. They are recognised initially at the transaction price 
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or 
receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments.

3. Auditor’s remuneration
Fees payable to the Company’s auditor for the audit of the Company and Consolidated Financial Statements are disclosed in Note 6 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other payables relate to the 25,000,000 issued Non-Voting Preference Shares with a coupon rate of 9.5% per annum. The non-voting 
preference shares are entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and can only be redeemed after 5 consecutive calendar years commencing 
on the date of issue, 17 July 2022, and hence the Company has an unavoidable obligation to deliver cash. The Company has, therefore, 
classified the non-voting preference shares as a financial liability.

Directors’ Report

This Directors’ Report contains information to be given 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. Relevant 
information below, which is contained elsewhere in this 
Annual Report, is incorporated by cross reference.

Group subsidiaries 
As a Group that operates globally, Haleon’s operations and 
activities are carried out by subsidiaries, branches and scientific/
representative offices established under the laws of many 
jurisdictions. A full list of subsidiaries is provided at Note 30 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 170. 

Directors’ powers
The Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company, 
subject to the Articles of Association (Articles), legislation and 
regulation. This includes the ability, subject to shareholder 
approval at Haleon’s AGM each year, to exercise the authority 
to allot or purchase the Company’s shares. Further details of 
the powers of the Directors can be found in the Articles of 
Association section on page 203. 

Conflicts of interest
Under the Articles and as permitted by the Companies Act, 
the Board may authorise any matter which would otherwise 
involve a Director breaching their duty to avoid conflicts 
of interest and may attach to any such authorisation such 
conditions and/or restrictions as the Board deems appropriate 
(including in respect of the receipt of information or restrictions 
on participation at Board meetings). The Board has a formal 
system for Directors to declare such situations to be considered 
for authorisation by those Directors who have no interest in the 
matter being considered. Situations considered by the Board and 
authorisations given are recorded in the Board minutes and in a 
register of conflicts maintained by the Company Secretary and 
are reviewed annually by the Board. The Board believes that this 
system operates effectively.

Insurance and indemnities
The Company maintained directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
cover during the period of this Annual Report. Each Director 
also benefits from an indemnity provided by the Company in 
respect of any proceedings brought by third parties against 
them personally in their capacity as Director. 

Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct (Code) applies to the Board and Executive 
Team, employees and third-party temporary workers and complies 
with the NYSE rules as set out in Section 406 of SOX. Our Code 
includes a prohibition on engaging in insider trading or use of 
non-public information that could manipulate the price of Haleon’s 
shares, either to our own advantage or for another person and 
also applies to any other company with which we do business. 
Further details on our Code are set out in the Strategic Report on 
pages 18 and 20, and the Board’s oversight of the Code is set out 
on pages 69 and 75.

Shares
As at 31 December 2023, the Company had 9,234,573,831 
ordinary shares of £0.01 each and 25,000,000 non-voting 
preference shares of £1.00 each in issue. No shares were held 
in Treasury. There are no special control rights or restrictions 
on share transfers or limitations on the holding of any class of 
shares. Further information about the Company’s ordinary shares 
and non-voting preference shares can be found in Articles of 
Association on page 203.

At its AGM held in April 2023, Haleon received shareholder 
approval to make purchases of its own ordinary shares 
(i) on-market up to a maximum number representing 10% of its 
issued share capital and (ii) off-market up to a maximum number 
representing 4.99% of its issued share capital from each of GSK 
and Pfizer, subject to limitations on the maximum price applicable 
to each purchase, and noting that no more than 10% of its issued 
share capital would be purchased in aggregate pursuant to these 
authorities. During the year, the Company did not purchase any 
of its own shares. Resolutions seeking shareholder authority for 
the purchase of the Company’s shares will be put to shareholders 
at the AGM to be held on 8 May 2024.

Dividends and dividend policy
On 29 February 2024, the Board proposed a final dividend of 
4.2p per ordinary share which will be paid, subject to shareholder 
approval, following the Company’s 2024 AGM. The Company paid 
an interim dividend of 1.8p per ordinary share on 5 October 2023 
in respect of its 2023 half-year results. In respect of trading since 
demerger to 31 December 2022, the Company paid a final 
dividend of 2.4p per ordinary share on 27 April 2023. 

Haleon has a dividend policy that looks to balance all its 
stakeholders’ interests while ensuring the long-term success of 
the Company. Subject to market conditions and Board approval, 
Haleon expects to grow its ordinary dividend at least in line 
with adjusted earnings. Future ordinary dividends are expected 
to be paid half-yearly with approximately one third of the 
dividend paid as an interim dividend, following the Company’s 
half-year results, and the balance paid as a final dividend, 
subject to shareholder approval, following the Company’s AGM. 
Dividends are announced in Pound Sterling, with an equivalent 
US Dollar amount paid in respect of the Company’s ADSs. 

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 132, 
for information on dividends paid on non-voting preference shares.

Financial risk management
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies, 
including its use of financial instruments, are set out in Note 25 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 156. 

Future business developments of the Group
Details of these are set out in the Strategic Report from page 2.

Other Information

Other Information

Significant shareholders
The following persons have disclosed an interest in the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company in accordance with the 
requirements of rules 5.1.2 or 5.1.5 of the FCA’s Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules. The Company’s major 
shareholders have the same voting rights as other shareholders. 
The Company does not know of any arrangements the operation 
of which may result in a change in its control. Other than as set 
out below, no changes to major shareholdings were disclosed to 
the Company between 31 December 2023 and 7 March 2024. 

The Company is a party to the Pfizer Relationship Agreement, 
the principal purpose of which is to regulate the continuing 
relationship between the Company and its controlling 
shareholder, Pfizer Inc., following demerger. Pfizer retains a 

significant interest in the Company including 32% of Haleon’s 
shares and thus of the voting rights of the Company. As a result, 
Pfizer possesses sufficient voting power to exercise significant 
influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, 
including the election or removal of Directors and advisers, 
the declaration of dividends, whether to accept the terms of 
a takeover offer and other matters to be determined by the 
Haleon shareholders. 

In addition, Pfizer has the right to nominate two persons to 
be appointed to the Board as representative Directors for so 
long as it continues to hold 20% or more of Haleon’s shares in 
issue, and a right to nominate one person to be appointed as a 
representative Director for so long as it continues to hold less 
than 20% but at least 10% of Haleon’s shares in issue.

Share plan details
2023 share awards and grants to employees
Our current policy is to settle the majority of awards or grants 
under the Company’s share plans with shares purchased in 
the market, however, the Company continues to review this 
policy. The Company’s share plans incorporate the Investment 
Association’s current guidelines on dilution. During the year, the 
Company satisfied its obligations under its share plans solely 
by the purchase of shares in the market, accordingly there has 
been no dilution from the awards made. As at 31 December 2023, 
there were 5,489,346 options outstanding, solely in respect of the 
Company’s HMRC-approved all-employee Share Save Plan. 

Employee benefit trusts (EBTs)
The Group operates EBTs for the benefit of employees and 
former employees. The EBTs purchase ordinary shares or ADSs 
in the market and release them to current and former employees 
in satisfaction of share awards. During 2023, the EBTs released 
414,105 ordinary shares and 316,435 ADSs. At 31 December 2023 
the EBTs held 5,309,233 ordinary shares and 2,545,712 ADSs in the 
Company. The EBTs adopt a prudent approach to purchasing shares, 
using funds provided by the Group, based on expectations of 
future requirements. 

Shares or ADSs that have not been allocated to share plan 
participants are held by the EBTs and although the trustee has 
the right to vote or abstain from exercising their voting rights in 
relation to those shares, it has a policy of not voting, which is in 
line with guidelines. The trustee also has the right to accept or 
reject any offer relating to the shares or ADSs in any way it sees 
fit. Dividend waivers are in place in respect of unallocated shares 
and ADSs held in the EBTs.

The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) 
Regulations 2018
Employee engagement 
The below statement relates to our employees as defined in the 
glossary and should be read in conjunction with our stakeholder 
and people disclosures in the Strategic Report on pages 10 
and 18, respectively, Section 172 statement and workforce 
engagement disclosures from page 69, and other engagement 
disclosures in the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 80. 

During 2023, the key forms of engagement to provide 
information to our employees included a fortnightly global email 
‘Connecting Haleon’, intranet global news page, CEO-led global 
broadcasts, fireside chats on priority topics, internal social 
media channels, dedicated senior manager calls, as well as 
regional leadership calls and direct emails, videos and business 
function team meetings. Employees have been consulted and 
given opportunities to express their views and concerns through 
participation in the annual employee engagement survey, team 
meetings, townhalls, ERGs, and Q&As at global broadcasts and 
fireside chats. They have been made aware of the financial and 
economic factors affecting the performance of the Company 
through quarterly, global broadcasts and emails from the CEO, 
internal social media updates, as well as functional and regional 
team meetings. The Chair and Directors have engaged with 
employees through direct interactions, ‘employee listening 
sessions’ with our Workforce Engagement Director and other 
opportunities held during the year to meet Executive Directors 
via video meetings or in person. 

Engagement with suppliers, customers and others 
in a business relationship with Haleon
Our business relationships with our suppliers, customers and 
others are fundamental to our success. During the year, the Board 
considered matters related to them and had regard to the impact 
of decisions on them as detailed in the Section 172 statement on 
page 69. The Board monitors relationships through a mixture of 
presentations, reports and direct engagement. Details of how 
relationships have been maintained throughout the year are set 
out in the our key stakeholders section on page 10.

Directors’ Report continued

Employment of disabled persons
Our commitment is to ensure our workforce reflects the 
diversity of the communities within which we operate, and we 
believe in the power of diversity as a source of competitive 
advantage. We are striving to create an inclusive environment in 
which everyone can contribute and feel a sense of belonging, are 
understood and valued, treated fairly and equally, and supported 
to progress and thrive. We want our employees to be able to 
be their authentic selves and, as a result, perform at their best. 
All employees must ensure an equitable and inclusive culture 
free of discrimination and encourage respectful and inclusive 
behaviour. Every effort is made to ensure that applications for 
employment from disabled people are fully and fairly considered 
and that disabled employees have equal opportunities for 
training, career development and promotion. 

Significant agreements and change of 
control provisions
The Group is a party to certain arrangements which could be 
terminated upon a change of control of the Company (and/
or the Group’s UK and US debt-issuing entities) and which are 
considered significant in terms of their potential impact on 
the business of the Group as a whole. These arrangements 
include each series of notes issued under the Company’s 
EMTN programme and the USD note programme. 

The notes contain a redemption or purchase upon change of 
control provision which, if triggered, allows note holders to 
exercise their option to require the UK and US debt-issuing 
entities to redeem, or at such issuers’ options, to purchase, 
the notes and pay any accrued and unpaid interest due. 

Political donations
The Group does not make political contributions or sponsor 
political meetings, conferences, conventions, or events, as set 
out in our Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABAC) Policy. In the 
year to 31 December 2023, the Group did not make any political 
contributions or provide any sponsorship. 

In accordance with the Federal Election Campaign Act in the US, 
Haleon employees are able to make personal contributions to 
our US Political Action Committee (PAC). A PAC is a corporate 
or labour-based political committee that collects voluntary 
contributions from eligible US employees into a separate fund. 
In donating to the PAC, participating eligible employees are 
exercising their legal right to pool their resources and make 
political contributions, which are subject to strict limitations 
under US law. The fund is managed by a board of directors of 
participating employees from Haleon’s US operating company 
and makes contributions or expenditures in connection with 
Federal and State elections. The PAC is not controlled by Haleon. 
The operations of the Haleon PAC are reviewed regularly to 
ensure compliance with applicable US laws. Disclosure reports 
for the Haleon PAC can be viewed at www.fec.gov. In 2023, a 
total of $57,500 was donated to political organisations by the 
Haleon PAC. 

Further information on the notes issued and outstanding under 
the programmes as at 31 December 2023 is available in Note 19 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 143. 

In addition, the Company is a party to the Pfizer Relationship 
Agreement, the principal purpose of which is to regulate the 
continuing relationship between the Company and its controlling 
shareholder, Pfizer, following demerger. This terminates upon 
Pfizer (or a member of its group) ceasing to hold at least 10% of 
Haleon’s ordinary shares. Throughout the period under review, 
the Company has complied with provisions and obligations in 
the Pfizer Relationship Agreement and, as far as the Company 
is aware, Pfizer has also complied. Further information on the 
Pfizer Relationship Agreement can be found on page 207. 

Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)
In line with the requirements set out in the UK Government’s 
guidance on SECR, the table on page 189 represents Haleon’s 
energy use and associated carbon emissions from electricity 
and fuel in the UK and the rest of the world (ROW), calculated 
with reference to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard. In our 2022 reporting period, 
the UK accounted for 4% of our global total energy use as well as 
3% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (location-based).

English law requires prior shareholder approval for political 
contributions to political parties and independent election 
candidates as well as for any political expenditure. The definitions 
of political donations, political expenditure and political 
organisations used in the legislation are, however, quite broad. 
As a result, the definitions may cover legitimate business activities 
not in the ordinary sense considered to be political donations 
or political expenditure, nor are they designed to support any 
political party or independent election candidate. Therefore, 
notwithstanding our policy, and while we do not intend to make 
donations to any political parties or organisations, nor to incur 
any political expenditure, we will annually seek shareholder 
authorisation for any inadvertent expenditure as a precautionary 
measure to ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries do not 
inadvertently breach the legislation.

Energy efficiency action taken
In 2023, we focused on developing and beginning to implement 
our strategy to reduce Scope 1 carbon emissions, having achieved 
100% renewable electricity at sites within our operational control 
in 2022. This strategy, when fully implemented, will replace most 
of our fossil-fuelled boilers with electric ones to meet our 2030 
goal to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 
95% versus our 2020 baseline. To maintain 100% renewable 
electricity at sites within our operational control, we utilise a 
combination of on-site solar, Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), 
and renewable electricity certificates. In 2023, we spent more 
than £5.7m on energy-reduction projects to install additional 
solar generation at two of our sites, as well as implement more 
energy-efficient equipment and improved metering at several 
of our sites.

>>  KPMG LLP’s limited assurance opinion and Haleon’s reporting criteria are available at www.haleon.com/our-impact/esg-reporting-hub

*  KPMG LLP has issued independent limited assurance over the selected data indicated using assurance standards ISAE(UK)3000 and ISAE3410.
1  Data for 2021 and 2022 have been calculated in accordance with methodology and data improvements, for example replacing estimates with actuals. The 2022 results have also been 
re-stated to align with the calendar year, rather than December 2021 – November 2022 as they were reported in the 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F. As a result, some values differ 
slightly from the values disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F, as disclosed in Haleon’s Basis of Reporting, available on the ESG Reporting Hub.

2  For the 2023 reporting period we have used data from 1 December 2022 to 30 November 2023. The exception is Scope 3, where the 2023 reporting period is 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023.
3  GHG emissions are expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) reflecting the effective amount of CO2 generated by all gas emissions which add to the greenhouse effect and 

global warming. Carbon emissions have been calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (updated with Scope 2 guidance). 
For further information on the methodologies used to calculate our emissions and energy metrics, please see our reporting criteria Basis of Reporting available at the web address 
outlined above. Scope of reporting is sites over which Haleon has full operational control.

4  This calculation takes the total emissions offset in the reporting period into account.
5  Carbon emissions intensity is derived from the ratio of the total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (location-based) (tCO2e) from all sites where we have full operational control to the 

total revenue in the same reporting period. This provides a stable and comparable metric at this time.

Other Information

On 2 March 2015, GSK and Novartis formed a consumer 
healthcare joint venture to combine the majority of GSK’s 
consumer healthcare business and all of Novartis’ OTC business. 
Novartis’ business provided GSK with a meaningful incremental 
presence in OTC. The combination added a leading portfolio of 
globally recognised consumer-preferred and expert-recommended 
brands in the Pain Relief, Respiratory Health, Smokers’ Health and 
Skin Health categories to the Group’s business. 

In June 2018, GSK acquired Novartis’ shareholding in the 
GSK/Novartis JV for $13bn, enabling GSK to take full operational 
and strategic control of the business. 

On 31 July 2019, GSK completed a transaction with Pfizer to 
combine substantially all of GSK and Pfizer’s respective consumer 
healthcare businesses into a new world-leading consumer 
healthcare joint venture (the Pfizer Transaction). The transaction, 
which was transformational to the scale of the Group’s business, 
brought together two businesses with highly complementary 
geographic footprints and brand portfolios. 

While the Group retained its strong European footprint, completion 
of the transaction also provided the Group with incremental 
geographical scale in the US, where it became the leader in 
OTC/VMS, and in China, where it became the leading OTC/VMS 
multinational. From a portfolio perspective, the transaction 
provided the Group with global leadership in the higher-growth 
VMS market as well as a leading presence in the US Pain Relief 
market complementing the Group’s existing Pain Relief portfolio. 
Since completion of the Pfizer Transaction and prior to demerger, 
GSK owned 68% of the ordinary shares in the entity through 
which both GSK and Pfizer held their equity interests in the joint 
venture, with Pfizer holding the remaining 32%. 

Alongside integration of the Pfizer consumer healthcare business, 
the Group exited approximately 50 non-strategic and growth-
dilutive OTC and skincare assets from 2019 to 2021 to raise 
£1.1bn of net proceeds. These disposals have further focused 
the business on higher-growth categories, markets and channels 
and thereby enhanced the growth profile of Haleon. 

Group information

History and development of the Group

Haleon is the result of the combination of three consumer 
health businesses over the last decade. The focus of the business 
has been sharpened through divestment of growth-dilutive 
brands and those outside of our core categories. In addition, 
the scientific and consumer products’ experience of its legacy 
businesses has been enhanced by investment in commercial 
and scientific capabilities, technologies and facilities, most 
notably in the digital sphere. 

On 18 July 2022, Haleon demerged from GSK creating a company 
with management, infrastructure, capital allocation and incentives 
focused specifically on consumer healthcare. 

The Group has a strong and established presence in all key 
channels relevant for consumer healthcare and a scale which allows 
it to effectively engage with retail partners of all sizes, buying 
groups, distributors, pharmacy chains and individual pharmacies. 

Prior to demerger, the Group had transformed since 2012 through 
progressive strategic M&A and divestments to create a world 
leader in consumer health. 

The Group’s scale greatly expanded through the successful 
combination of the legacy GSK consumer healthcare business 
with the Novartis consumer healthcare business in 2015, and the 
subsequent combination of this business with the Pfizer consumer 
healthcare business in 2019. In addition, the Group’s focus has 
been sharpened since 2012 through the progressive divestment 
of GSK’s nutritionals businesses and the divestment by the 
Group of non-strategic OTC brands, including its programme 
of divestments of non-strategic and growth-dilutive brands 
(with aggregate net proceeds from divested brands of £1.1bn) 
during the period from 2019 to 2021. This deliberate strategy has 
resulted in a portfolio more focused on higher-growth categories, 
markets and channels. These transactions also provided a 
catalyst for a broader transformation of the Group. 

Prior to its combination with the Novartis consumer healthcare 
business in 2015, GSK’s consumer healthcare business was 
already one of the world’s leading OTC and Oral Health 
companies with a long heritage in consumer health products 
dating back to the 18th century. The Group sold a range of 
leading OTC brands across Respiratory Health, Pain Relief, 
Digestive Health, Skin Health and Smokers’ Health, together with 
a strong portfolio of Oral Health brands. Geographically, the GSK 
consumer healthcare business had a strong presence in higher- 
growth emerging markets in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, 
which complemented its businesses in Europe and North America.

Further information can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report from page 80.

Property, plant and equipment

The Group has interests in properties in numerous countries. 
None of these interests is individually material in the context 
of the Group as a whole. Such properties are used by the 
Group predominantly for manufacturing, distribution and R&D 
activities. In particular, the Group owns a supply chain of 24 
in-house dedicated consumer health manufacturing sites, with 
key sites located in Levice (Slovakia), Dungarvan (Ireland), Nyon 
(Switzerland) and Guayama (Puerto Rico). In addition, the Group 
owns four R&D centres in Richmond, Virginia (USA), Weybridge 
(UK), Maidenhead (UK) and Suzhou (China) providing it with a 
broad range of in-house scientific capabilities. 

The Group is not aware of any environmental issues affecting 
its properties which would have a material impact upon the 
Group, and there are no material encumbrances on its properties. 
The Group believes its existing facilities are satisfactory for its 
current business and it currently has no plans to construct new 
facilities or expand or improve its current facilities in a manner 
that is material to the Group. 

Disclosure controls and procedures

The Group carried out an evaluation under the supervision and 
with the participation of members of the Group’s management, 
including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design 
and operation of the Group’s disclosure controls and procedures 
as required by Item 15(a) of Form 20-F as at 31 December 2023. 
Based on their evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, 
as at that date, the Company maintained an effective system of 
disclosure controls and procedures. 

Management’s report on internal control 
over financial reporting

In accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX, 
the following report is provided by management in respect 
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as 
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the US Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)).

 — Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting for the 
Group. Internal control over financial reporting is designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of Financial Statements 
for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. 

 — Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness 
of internal control over financial reporting based on the 
framework, Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of 
the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

 — There have been no changes in the Group’s internal control 
over financial reporting during 2023 that have materially 
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the 
Group’s internal control over financial reporting. 

 — Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal 

control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2023 and 
concluded it is effective. 

 — KPMG LLP, which has audited the Consolidated Financial 

Statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023, 
has also assessed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control over financial reporting under Auditing Standard 2201 
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (US). 
Their audit report is set out from page 112.

Change in certifying accountant

On 20 April 2023, Haleon shareholders approved the 
appointment of KPMG LLP (KPMG UK) as its principal accountants 
for the financial year ending 31 December 2023 at its AGM. 
KPMG US, which was formerly serving as the Company’s principal 
accountants in respect of the US, declined to stand for re-election. 
The decision to change principal accountants was approved by 
the Haleon plc Board on the recommendation of the Company’s 
Audit & Risk Committee. 

In respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2022, there 
were no: (i) disagreements with KPMG US on any matter of 
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, 
or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not 
resolved to their satisfaction would have caused them to make 
reference in connection with their opinion to the subject matter 
of the disagreement, or (ii) reportable events. 

The audit report of KPMG US on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Haleon plc and subsidiaries as of and for the year 
ended 31 December 2022 did not contain any adverse opinion 
or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to 
uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. 

We did not consult KPMG UK during our two most recent 
financial years or any subsequent interim period regarding (i) the 
application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, 
either completed or proposed or the type of audit opinion 
that might be rendered on our Financial Statements; or (ii) any 
matter that was the subject of a disagreement as that term is 
used in Item 16F(a)(1)(iv) of Form 20-F or a ‘reportable event’ 
as described in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F.

Risk factors

The Group has identified a broad range of risks relating to its 
business and the industry in which it operates. These risks 
are described below and, together with all other information 
contained in this Annual Report, should be carefully considered 
in evaluating the Group. The risks and uncertainties described 
below represent those we consider to be material as at the date 
of this Annual Report, with material risks being those to which 
senior management pay particular attention and which could 
cause the delivery of the Group’s strategy, financial condition, 
results of operations and/or prospects to differ materially from 
expectations. However, these risks and uncertainties are not the 
only ones facing the Group. 

If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, 
results of operations and prospects could be materially and 
adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not 
presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial 
also may impair our business operations. 

The Group’s ability to execute its marketing and sales strategy 
is subject to challenges

As a consumer products business, the Group relies on a strategy 
of leveraging its existing brands and products to drive increased 
sales and profits. The successful implementation of this strategy 
depends on, among other things, the Group’s ability to: identify 
and offer competitively priced products that appeal to evolving 
consumer preferences; formulate its strategy in response to these 
changing consumer preferences; innovate successfully on its 
existing products; and effectively utilise a range of distribution 
channels in its key markets. 

Failure to execute this strategy successfully for any reason, 
including any reduction in consumer demand for the types of 
products which the Group offers due to changes in consumer 
lifestyle, environmental concerns, economic downturns or other 
considerations could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks relating to the Group’s business and industry
The Group operates in a highly competitive market

The Group’s business results are impacted by the Group’s 
ability to manage disruptions in the Group’s global supply chain

The Group faces substantial and increasing competition in all 
of its product categories and geographic markets. There are 
relatively low barriers to entry in certain product categories in 
many of the markets in which the Group operates (particularly 
in the VMS category) and accordingly the Group’s businesses 
compete with companies of all sizes on many different fronts, 
including cost-effectiveness, product effectiveness and quality, 
brand recognition and loyalty, technological innovations, 
consumer convenience, promotional activities, new product 
introductions and expansion into new markets and channels. 

The Group expects to continue to see heightened activity from its 
competitors worldwide, including: (i) increasing and aggressive 
competition from smaller, high-growth companies which often 
operate on a regional basis, and may disrupt existing route-to-
market models; (ii) increasing competition from multinational 
corporations moving for the first time into, or expanding or 
focusing their presence (whether through acquisitions, disposals, 
demergers or other means) in the global consumer healthcare 
market; (iii) continuing competition from private label products, 
which are brands sold exclusively by a particular retailer; and (iv) 
an increase in the introduction and aggressive marketing of new 
products in high demand healthcare areas. 

Some of the Group’s competitors may conduct more effective 
advertising and promotion activities than the Group does, 
introduce competing products more quickly and/or respond more 
effectively to business and economic conditions and changing 
consumer preferences, including by launching innovative new 
products. If the Group is unable to anticipate the timing and scale 
of these threats across its markets or to successfully respond to 
them, then its brand loyalty may be harmed, it may lose market 
share and its business, prospects, results of operations and 
financial condition may be materially adversely affected. 

The Group is engaged in the manufacturing and sourcing of 
products and materials on a global scale. The Group’s operations 
and those of its suppliers, contract manufacturers and logistics 
providers have been and may continue to be disrupted by a 
number of factors, including, but not limited to: increased and/
or changing regulation, as well as regulatory compliance issues; 
environmental events, including natural disasters (such as fires, 
floods and earthquakes) and any potential effect of climate 
change; global shipping, logistics, transport and warehousing 
constraints, for example due to regional or local conflicts (such 
as the recent conflict in the Middle East and shipping disruption 
in the Red Sea) or widespread health emergencies, such as 
pandemics or epidemics any of which may lead to delays in 
deliveries and constraints on shipping and logistics as a result 
of local lockdowns; global supply chain disruption impacting 
their suppliers; strikes and other labour disputes; cybersecurity 
failures or incidents; loss, impairment, closure or disruption of 
key manufacturing sites; loss of, or capacity constraints relating 
to key suppliers or contract manufacturers; raw material and 
product quality or safety issues (see The Group may incur 
liabilities or be forced to recall products as a result of real or 
perceived product quality or other product-related issues on 
page 196); industrial accidents or other occupational health 
and safety issues; the impact on the Group’s suppliers of tighter 
credit or capital markets; the lack of availability, or retention, 
of qualified personnel; governmental incentives and controls 
(including exchange controls, import and export restrictions, 
such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade 
barriers); acts of war (see The Group’s business may be impacted 
by the effects of regional and local conflicts on page 200) or 
terrorism, political unrest or uncertainty, fires or explosions, and 
other external factors over which the Group has no control; and 
increases in ingredient, commodity, utilities and oil prices. 

While the product ranges of the Group’s leading brands are 
manufactured by multiple sources, some of the Group’s products 
are currently primarily manufactured at a single location and the 
loss of the use of all or a portion of any of these manufacturing 
facilities or the loss of the use of, or capacity constraints at, key 
suppliers in relation to the Group’s other products could impact 
the Group’s ability to provide these products.

Group information continued

Risk factors continued

In addition, the Group purchases certain raw and packaging 
materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of 
suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under 
industry, governmental and its own standards, which can require 
additional investment and take a significant period of time. 

Although the Group has contingency plans in place, such as dual 
sourcing programmes and alternative supply arrangements, those 
plans may not be sufficient to mitigate manufacturing or supplier 
interruptions, and the Group may also be limited in its ability to 
pass on any increases in the prices it charges for its products as a 
result of fixed-price supply agreements or hedging arrangements. 

A significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of 
products or materials for any reason, including those mentioned 
above, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, 
could lead to litigation or regulatory action, product delistings by 
retailers, financial penalties, and reputational damage that could 
materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, results of 
operations and financial condition. 

Increasing dependence on key retail customers, changes in 
the policies of the Group’s retail customers, the emergence 
of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing 
retail landscape

The Group’s products are sold in a highly competitive 
global marketplace which has experienced increased trade 
concentration and the growing presence, in both traditional and 
digital operations, of large-scale retailers, including pharmacies, 
discounters and e-commerce retailers. The Group is increasingly 
dependent on certain retailers, and some of these retailers have 
and may continue to have greater bargaining strength than the 
Group does. For example, similar to its competitors, while the 
Group maintains relationships with a variety of significant retailers 
across its key markets, sales attributable to its top five largest 
retailers account for over half of the Group’s revenue in the 
US market. 

The Group’s large-scale retail customers, including pharmacies, 
may use their leverage to demand higher trade discounts, 
allowances, display fees or increased investment, which could 
lead to reduced sales or profitability. The loss of a key retailer or 
a significant reduction in sales to a key retailer could materially 
and adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of 
operations and financial condition. The Group’s business might also 
be negatively affected by the growing presence and bargaining 
strength of customers who operate internationally and retail 
buying alliances (horizontal alliances of retailers, retail chains or 
entire retailer groups that cooperate in pooling their resources) 
and the enhanced leverage that such alliances possess. 

The Group has also been and may continue to be negatively 
affected by changes in the policies or practices of the Group’s 
retail trade and pharmacy customers, such as inventory de-stocking, 
limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of the Group’s 
products, or environmental, sustainability, supply chain or 
packaging initiatives and other conditions.

Private label products sold by the Group’s retail customers, 
which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, 
are a source of competition for certain of the Group’s products. 
In addition, the retail landscape in many of the Group’s markets 
continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of e-commerce 
retailers (who are able to generate private label products 

and capitalise on access to data) and price comparison sites, 
changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly 
shop online), and, in certain categories (particularly VMS), 
the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as 
subscription services, sales through social media platforms 
and direct-to-consumer businesses (especially those which 
specialise in rapid distribution). The strong growth in e-commerce 
and the emergence of alternative retail channels may create 
pricing and margin pressures and/or adversely affect the 
Group’s relationships with key retailers. If the Group is not 
able to successfully manage and adapt to these changes in 
the retail landscape, the Group’s business, prospects, results 
of operations and financial condition could be materially and 
adversely affected. 

The Group may not be able to develop and commercialise 
new products effectively

The future growth of the Group is to a significant extent 
dependent on its ability to develop new products or new 
formulations of existing products. The Group’s ability to launch 
new products and to expand into adjacent categories, channels 
of distribution or markets is affected by whether the Group 
can successfully: identify, develop and fund technological 
innovations; obtain and maintain necessary intellectual 
property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property 
rights of others; obtain and maintain approvals and registrations 
of regulated products in the countries in which the Group has 
business operations; anticipate the needs and preferences of 
consumers and customers by, among other things, effectively 
utilising digital technology and marketing and data analytics to 
gain new commercial insights and develop or identify relevant 
products aligned to those preferences; and successfully 
compete to in-license products. 

The identification, development and introduction of innovative 
new products that drive incremental sales involves considerable 
time, costs and effort, as well as significant risk that any new 
product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer 
interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover 
the costs of its development and promotion. New products 
must be developed to meet the Group’s own rigorous internal 
specifications, as well as the relevant regulatory and safety 
requirements imposed in our various markets. Each of these 
restrictions means that a new product can fail to make it to 
market at any stage or do so in a cost-effective manner. In addition, 
new products that make it to market may not be accepted quickly 
or significantly in the marketplace. 

Any failure to develop and commercialise new products in a 
timely fashion may lead to decreased market share, decreased 
revenue and/or increased R&D costs and, consequently, may 
materially and adversely affect the results of the Group’s 
operations and financial condition. 

Failure to retain key talent or attract new talent

The Group relies upon a number of key executives and employees 
who have an in-depth understanding of the consumer healthcare 
industry and the Group’s technologies, products, programmes, 
collaborative relationships and strategic goals. While the Group 
follows a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and 
has succession plans in place for those individuals comprising 
our Board of Directors and our Executive Team (as set out on 
pages 62 to 65) (Senior Management) and other key executives, 
these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior 
executives will continue to be available to the Group at all times. 

194

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Other Information

Other Information

Competition for such talent is intense, and there can be no 
assurance that the Group will be able to continue to attract and 
retain such talent. 

Failure to respond effectively to the challenges raised by 
climate change and other sustainability and ESG matters

If the Group is unable to recruit, attract and retain talented, 
highly qualified Senior Management and other key people for any 
reason the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations and 
financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

Damage to the Group’s reputation

Maintaining the Group’s strong reputation and trust with consumers 
and customers globally is critical to selling the Group’s branded 
products. Negative publicity, posts or comments on social 
media about the Group, its products, the ways it does business, 
threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings, its 
public policy engagement, environmental, social and governance 
practices, including as they relate to diversity, equality and 
inclusion, the health, safety and welfare of employees or other 
stakeholders, or relations with its employees, or regulatory 
infractions, violations of sanctions or anti-bribery rules, whether 
or not deserved, could jeopardise the Group’s reputation and/or 
expose it to adverse press and social media attention. Whether 
true or untrue, such negative publicity, posts or comments on 
social media could damage the Group’s brands and its reputation 
and/or lead to boycotts of its products. Moreover, the Group’s 
reputation could be harmed as a result of inappropriate use of 
its branded products being promoted on social media and any 
associated negative publicity. 

The Group’s reputation may also be adversely affected if 
third parties with whom the Group contracts (or an owner, 
acquirer or other related party of such), including its suppliers, 
manufacturers and customers, fail to maintain high ethical, 
social and environmental standards, comply with local laws 
and regulations or become subject to other negative events or 
adverse publicity. While the Group has policies and procedures 
for managing third-party relationships, it may not be possible to 
fully ensure that third parties adhere to the same standards and 
values as the Group or to replace third-party relationships in a 
timely and/or cost-effective manner. 

Counterfeiting is a common issue for successful brands and has 
been amplified by the growth of e-commerce. Although the Group 
has an anti-counterfeiting programme in place, third parties 
continue to sell counterfeit versions of the Group’s products. 
These counterfeits are inferior in quality to the genuine Group 
products and may pose safety risks to consumers. Consumers of 
the Group’s brands could confuse the Group’s products with or 
purchase these counterfeit products. The consumption of inferior 
quality products, which consumers believe to be genuine (and, 
in some instances, may cause consumer safety issues) could also 
damage the reputation of the Group and its brands and lead to a 
reduction in market share. 

Damage to the Group’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence 
in the Group’s products for these or any other reasons could 
materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, results of 
operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require 
resources to rebuild the Group’s reputation.

Concern over climate change and social impacts has increased 
the focus on the sustainability of practices and products in the 
market and may result in new or additional legal and regulatory 
requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change 
on the environment and social impacts. Areas of focus relevant 
to the Group’s business include, among others, responsible 
sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and 
water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including 
single-use and other plastic packaging, and the use of certain 
materials, such as palm oil where the environmental or social 
impact of the material can attract scrutiny. New or additional 
legal and regulatory requirements more stringent than the 
Group’s current legal and regulatory obligations and/or the 
Group’s existing practices and procedures, may require the 
Group to revise its operations and supply chain management. 
Such requirements may also require upgrades to our systems and 
processes for capturing ESG data, and compliant ESG reporting 
may therefore be dependent on those upgrades being in place 
and fully embedded. There may also be financial impacts as 
governments implement taxation initiatives, such as extended 
producer responsibility taxes or carbon taxes, to help recover 
the cost of managing plastic waste and the impacts of climate 
change. There may also be reputational impacts, including 
related impacts such as product delistings with customers or 
loss of preference with consumers, investors, employees or other 
stakeholders, should the Group fail, or be perceived to fail, to 
meet either its publicly stated sustainability goals or community 
expectations in relation to sustainability initiatives. For further 
information on the specific climate-related risks facing the Group, 
see Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, from 
page 24. These developments may result in increased costs and 
disruption to the Group’s operations, and to loss of revenue, 
which could materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, 
results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 

The Group may not be able to sufficiently protect its intellectual 
property rights or avoid claims of infringement on the 
intellectual property rights of others

The Group relies on various types of intellectual property rights 
such as trade marks, patents, copyrights and designs, whether 
registered or unregistered, as well as unpatented proprietary 
knowledge and trade secrets, to protect its business. However, 
these rights do not afford complete protection against third 
parties’ claims and infringements, for example, due to territorial 
limitations on intellectual property protections in certain 
markets in which the Group operates. Additionally, there can be 
no assurance that third parties will not independently develop 
knowledge and trade secrets that are similar to the Group’s, or 
develop products or brands that compete effectively with the 
Group’s products and brands without infringing, misusing or 
otherwise violating any of the Group’s intellectual property rights.

The Group’s intellectual property rights may also be challenged 
in the future. In the event of such a challenge, the Group could 
incur significant costs to defend its intellectual property rights, 
even if it is ultimately successful. Additionally, there is a risk that 
the Group will not be able to obtain licences for the intellectual 
property rights necessary to support new product introductions 
and product innovations.

Group information continued

Risk factors continued

The Group also uses intellectual property rights in-licensed from 
licensors. The Group’s licences to such intellectual property rights 
may not provide exclusive or unrestricted rights in all fields of use 
and in all territories in which the Group may wish to develop or 
commercialise its products in the future, may restrict its rights to 
offer certain products in certain markets, and may not grant the 
Group full control over the maintenance, protection, enforcement 
or use of such intellectual property rights, leaving the Group 
reliant on the licensors to conduct such activities. 

Further, the agreements under which the Group licenses 
intellectual property rights from others are complex, and the 
provisions of such agreements may be susceptible to multiple 
interpretations. As such, resolution of any dispute relating to 
such contracts may be costly, time-consuming and ultimately 
narrow the scope of the Group’s rights to the intellectual 
property being licensed, or increase what the Group believes to 
be its financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement. 

Infringement, misuse or other violation of any of the Group’s 
intellectual property rights, including by current or former 
employees, contractors or third parties, may dilute or diminish 
the value and goodwill of the Group’s brands and products in 
the marketplace, which could materially and adversely affect 
the Group’s results of operations and make it more difficult for 
the Group to maintain a strong market position, leading to a 
material and adverse effect on the Group’s business and results 
of operations. 

The Group may incur liabilities or be forced to recall products 
as a result of real or perceived product quality or other 
product-related issues

Failure to comply with good manufacturing or good distribution 
practices and regulations, as well as other regulations in relation 
to product quality, throughout the Group’s in-house and contract 
manufacturing supply and distribution chains, could lead to 
product supply interruptions, product recalls or withdrawals, 
litigation and/or regulatory enforcement action and fines from 
regulators, despite employee training, promotion of a health and 
safety culture, and control measures and systems being in place 
that are designed to ensure that the safety and quality of the 
Group’s products is maintained. Additionally, products may be 
contaminated or tampered with during distribution or at stores. 
The Group is increasingly using new technology to enhance the 
manufacture and testing of its products, such as the deployment 
of new electronic documentation systems and advanced 
laboratory information management tools. Such technology is 
inherently susceptible to the threat of cyber-attacks which pose 
an ongoing risk to the integrity of product quality data and its 
audit trail. The Group also continues to be reliant on third parties 
and is continuing to undertake a global network rationalisation 
programme to reduce the number of manufacturing sites it uses, 
both of which are factors that may increase the risks to safe and 
timely supply of products. 

Product recalls or withdrawals arising as a result of real or 
perceived product quality, efficacy, safety, environmental or other 
product-related issues, whether initiated on a voluntary basis or 
otherwise, can result in a range of adverse consequences to the 
Group, including lost sales, the requirement to hold increased 
inventories of substitute products, the cost of re-formulations, 
damaged relationships with regulators, loss of market share to 
competitors, adverse publicity and reputational harm, in addition 
to the direct costs of implementing any recall.  

Furthermore, such product quality or other product-related 
issues also expose the Group to a significant risk of litigation, 
particularly product liability claims, and regulatory action 
(see Risks related to litigation, disputes and regulatory 
investigations, from page 199). 

Failure by the Group to manufacture its products in accordance 
with good manufacturing practices could have the potential to 
do significant damage to the Group’s reputation and materially 
and adversely affect the results of its operations and financial 
condition. In addition, if any of the Group’s competitors or 
customers supply faulty or contaminated products to the market, 
the Group’s industry could be negatively impacted, which in turn 
could have material adverse effects on the Group’s business. 

A cyber-security incident, data breach or a failure of a key 
information technology system

The Group relies extensively on information technology systems 
(IT systems), including some which are managed, hosted, provided 
and/or used by third parties, including cloud-based service 
providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct its business. 

Although the Group has a broad array of information security 
measures in place, the Group’s IT systems, including those of 
third-party service providers with whom it has contracted, have 
been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses 
or other malicious codes, unauthorised access attempts, phishing 
and other cyber-attacks. 

Cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more 
frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming 
more sophisticated and are being made by groups, individuals 
and nation states with a wide range of expertise and motives. 
While the Group has implemented systems, monitoring and 
training to prevent cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents from 
being successful, the Group cannot guarantee that its security 
efforts will protect against breaches or breakdowns of its, or its 
third-party service providers’, IT systems since the techniques 
used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to 
detect for periods of time, and so such cyber-attacks may from 
time to time succeed. In addition, the Group cannot guarantee 
that it or its third-party service providers’ response to any such 
incidents will fully remedy the extent of the damage caused by 
these incidents. Although the Group has policies and procedures 
in place to ensure that all personal information collected by it 
or its third-party service providers is securely maintained, data 
breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional 
conduct may still occur in future. 

Furthermore, the Group periodically upgrades its IT systems 
or adopts new technologies. If such an upgrade or new 
technology does not function as designed, does not go as 
planned or increases the Group’s exposure to a cyber-attack or 
cyber incident, it may adversely impact the Group’s business, 
including its ability to ship products to customers, issue invoices 
and process payments or order raw and packaging materials. 
If the Group were to suffer a significant loss or disclosure of 
confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of 
a breach of its IT systems, including those of third-party service 
providers with whom it has contracted, or otherwise, the Group 
may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur 
significant costs and be subject to government investigations, 
litigation, fines and/or damages, which may materially and 
adversely impact the Group’s business, prospects, results of 
operations and financial condition.

196

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Other Information

Other Information

While the Group has disaster recovery and business continuity 
plans in place, if its IT systems were damaged, breached or were 
to cease to function properly for any reason or if it does not 
effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, the Group may 
suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business 
as well as reputational harm, and may be subject to governmental 
investigations and litigation, any of which may materially and 
adversely impact the Group’s business, prospects, results of 
operations and financial condition. 

The Group relies on third parties in many aspects of its business

Due to the scale and scope of the Group’s business, the Group 
relies on relationships with third parties, including its suppliers, 
contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial 
banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for 
route to market and for certain administrative and other functions. 
If the Group is unable to effectively manage and maintain its 
third-party relationships, including its contractual arrangements, 
if such third parties fail to meet their obligations to the Group or 
if there are substantial disruptions in the relationships between 
the Group and third parties, the Group’s results of operations 
could be adversely impacted. 

For example, in China, part of the Group’s business is conducted 
through a joint venture between Haleon, the Tianjin Pharmaceutical 
Group and Tianjin Pharmaceutical Da Ren Tang Group Corporation 
Limited (the TSK&F Joint Venture), pursuant to a joint venture 
agreement which is due to expire in September 2024. 

The Group is in discussions with the joint venture parties to agree 
an extension to the term of the TSK&F Joint Venture or alternative 
arrangements for the continued operation of its business. 
There can be no assurance that any extension, or alternative 
arrangements, would be implemented by September 2024 on 
terms which allow the Group to continue to operate its business 
in China on materially the same basis as it currently operates 
under the TSK&F Joint Venture, or at all. If the Group does not 
agree an extension to the term of the TSK&F Joint Venture or 
implement alternative arrangements, then the continuity and 
development of part of its operations and route to market in 
China, as well as its business, results of operations and cash 
flows in that market, may be adversely affected. 

Third-party relationships inherently involve the Group holding a 
lesser degree of control over business operations, and compliance 
with laws, regulations and Group policies and practices than is 
available for the Group’s own operations and compliance. As such, 
the Group’s financial, reputational, operational and legal risk is 
potentially increased, including in respect of health and safety, 
environmental, social and governance issues, modern slavery, 
and anti-bribery and corruption.

The Group faces various risks related to pandemics, epidemics 
or similar widespread public health concerns

A pandemic, epidemic or similar widespread health concern 
could have a variety of impacts on the Group’s business, results 
of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including: 
effects on the health, safety and wellbeing of the Group’s 
employees, including key employees; volatility in the demand for 
and availability of the Group’s products; decreases in demand 
and sales for certain of the Group’s products such as Theraflu 
and Robitussin due to a particularly weaker cold and flu season; 
changes in regulatory policy, including restrictions on sales of 
certain products; disruptions to the Group’s global supply chain 
due to, among other things, the availability of raw materials or 

manufacturing components; a decrease in the Group’s workforce 
or in the efficiency of such workforce as a result of illness, travel 
restrictions, absenteeism or governmental regulations and 
transportation and logistics challenges; failure of third parties on 
which the Group relies to meet their obligations to the Group, or 
significant disruptions in their ability to do so; restrictions on the 
Group’s employees’ ability to work and travel, mandated closure 
of certain distributors or retailers, the Group’s offices, shared 
business service centres and/or operating and manufacturing 
facilities, or other restrictions that could prevent the Group as 
well as its third-party partners, suppliers or customers from 
sufficiently staffing operations; disruptions and volatility in the 
global capital markets, which may increase the cost of capital 
and/or adversely impact the Group’s access to capital; and/or 
volatility in foreign exchange rates and in raw and packaging 
materials and logistics costs. 

Despite the Group’s efforts to manage these impacts, their 
ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond the Group’s 
knowledge or control, including the duration, severity and 
geographic scope of an outbreak, the availability, widespread 
distribution and use of safe and effective vaccines and the 
actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health 
and economic effects. 

The Group may not successfully acquire and integrate other 
businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form 
and manage alliances, or divest businesses

The Group may decide in the future to pursue acquisitions, 
technology licensing arrangements, strategic alliances or 
divestitures as part of its business strategy. The Group may 
not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-
effective basis or at all. In addition, the Group may be subject 
to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen 
factors that prevent it from realising the expected benefits 
of such transactions. 

Even if the Group is successful in completing an acquisition, 
the products, intellectual property and technologies that are 
acquired may not be successful or may require significantly 
greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. 
The Group may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully 
into its existing business, and the Group may be unable to 
achieve expected operating margin improvements, synergies or 
efficiencies. The Group could also incur or assume significant 
debt and unknown or contingent liabilities in connection with 
acquisitions. The Group’s reported operating results could be 
negatively affected by acquisition or disposition-related charges, 
amortisation of expenses related to intangibles and charges 
for impairment of long-term assets. The Group may be subject 
to litigation in connection with, or as a result of, acquisitions, 
dispositions, licences or other alliances and the Group may be 
liable for future or existing litigation and claims related to the 
acquired business, disposition, licence or other alliance because 
either the Group is not indemnified for such claims or the 
scope or availability of indemnification is limited. These effects 
could cause the Group to incur significant expenses and could 
materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, results of 
operations and financial condition.

Risk factors continued

Risks relating to the Group’s leverage and debt 
service obligations
Prior to the demerger, the Group incurred financial indebtedness 
in order to fund the pre-demerger dividend (as described in 
Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result, 
the Group has higher leverage levels than are reflected in the 
Group’s longer-term strategy and has significant debt service 
obligations. The Group’s longer-term strategy to improve its 
financial risk profile, including by reducing levels of indebtedness, 
may not be successful.

The Group’s outstanding financial indebtedness as at 
31 December 2023 is set out in Note 19 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

The degree to which the Group is leveraged could have important 
consequences for the Group’s business, including, but not 
limited to: increasing the Group’s vulnerability to, and reducing 
its flexibility to respond to, a downturn in the Group’s business 
or general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting 
the Group’s ability to obtain additional financing in the longer 
term; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of the 
Group’s cash flow from operations to the payment of interest 
on the Group’s indebtedness and the repayment of principal, 
thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund 
capital expenditures, dividends, joint ventures, acquisitions 
or other general corporate purposes; increasing the cost of 
future borrowings for the Group; a downgrade in the Group’s 
credit rating, which may, in turn, increase the cost of the Group’s 
financing arrangements and make it difficult for the Group to 
access financing on commercially acceptable terms or at all; 
limiting the Group’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, 
changes in the Group’s business and the competitive environment 
and the industry in which it operates; and placing the Group 
at a competitive disadvantage as compared to some of its 
competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged. 

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and 
results of operations. In addition, the Group may incur substantial 
additional indebtedness in the future. The covenants in existing 
financing instruments do not fully prohibit the Company or its 
subsidiaries from incurring more indebtedness. If new debt is 
added to the Group’s debt levels, the risks that it faces could 
intensify. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would 
increase the leverage-related risks described herein and would 
increase the risk of a downgrade in the Group’s credit rating. 

Goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets are a material 
component of the Group’s balance sheet and may be subject 
to impairments

The Group has recorded a significant amount of goodwill and 
indefinite-life intangible assets on its balance sheet as set out 
in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Group 
tests the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible 
assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations 
and cash flows made in connection with impairment testing could 
differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. 
Any resulting impairment charge, although non-cash, could have 
a material adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations 
and financial condition. 

Risks relating to changes in law and the political and 
economic environment, regulation and legislation
The Group’s business is subject to legal and regulatory risks 
in all the markets in which it operates

They apply to most aspects of the Group’s products, including 
their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, 
packaging content, labelling, storage, transportation, distribution, 
export, import, advertising, promotion beyond therapeutic 
indications, sale and environmental impact. Many different 
governmental and regulatory authorities in the Group’s markets 
regulate and have jurisdiction over different aspects of the 
Group’s business activities. In addition, the Group’s selling 
practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the UK, 
as well as in the EU, the US and other markets. 

Additionally, in China, where the Group has significant sales 
and operations, governmental authorities introduced changes 
in regulations relating to registrations of all generic medicines 
(including OTC products) and recently introduced changes for oral 
health products. These affect both new and existing products 
and impose increased data submission requirements for products 
the Group markets in China. There is a risk that commercialisation 
of certain products of the Group may be restricted in China if the 
Group is unable to comply with these regulatory changes on the 
required timetable. 

Because of the Group’s extensive international operations, 
the Group could be materially and adversely affected by 
violations of worldwide anti-bribery laws, including those 
that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making 
improper payments to government officials or other third parties 
for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the US 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010, and other 
laws that prohibit commercial bribery. Additionally, in certain 
jurisdictions, the Group’s engagement with Health Professionals 
and other external leaders is subject to applicable restrictions. 
While the Group’s policies mandate compliance with such laws, 
the Group cannot provide assurance that the Group’s internal 
control policies and procedures will always protect the Group 
from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, 
joint venture partners or agents. Similarly, due to the Group’s 
international operations, the Group could also be materially and 
adversely affected by any violations of international sanctions 
laws, which continue to evolve in response to geopolitical events 
(see also The Group’s business may be impacted by the effects of 
regional and local conflicts, on page 200). 

While it is the Group’s policy to comply with all legal and 
regulatory requirements applicable to the Group’s business, 
there can be no guarantee that the Group will always achieve 
full compliance and a finding that the Group is in violation of, 
or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could 
subject the Group to civil remedies, including fines, damages, 
injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions. Even if a 
claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, 
the Group may incur costs in responding to such a claim and 
negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding the 
Group’s products, processes or practices.

The Group faces risks relating to the regulation and perception 
of the ingredients it uses in its products

Regulatory bodies and consumer groups may, from time to time, 
request or conduct reviews of the use of certain ingredients that 
are used in manufacturing the Group’s products. If the result 
of such reviews is an inability to use, or restrictions on the use 

198

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

Other Information

Other Information

of, certain ingredients and/or any requirement for remedial 
action, the Group may incur significant additional costs and/
or need to invest substantial resources to make formulation 
adjustments to its products. Additionally, the Group may be 
adversely affected by the findings and any remedial actions 
resulting from the EU’s ongoing investigations into the impact 
of pharmaceuticals in the environment. 

While the Group monitors and seeks to respond to and 
address the impact of any emerging regulatory and legislative 
developments, new or more stringent ingredient legislation could 
have a negative impact on the Group’s business, undermine the 
Group’s reputation and goodwill and affect consumer demand or 
trade customer demand for products containing such ingredients. 
If the Group voluntarily removes, or is required to remove, certain 
ingredients from its products, it may not be able to develop an 
alternative formulation, successfully modify its existing products 
or obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, or 
at all, which could materially and adversely impact the Group’s 
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

The Group’s business is subject to market fluctuations and 
general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures 
and increased interest rates

Uncertainty, fluctuations or negative trends in the international 
economic climate have had and could continue to have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s business and profitability. 
There will be market fluctuations and economic factors that 
will be beyond the Group’s control, but that will have the 
potential to materially and adversely affect its business, revenue, 
financial condition and operating results. 

Such factors include: (i) inflation or deflation; (ii) changes in 
government, fiscal and monetary policies; (iii) changes in the 
financial standing of the Group’s customers, suppliers and 
consumers, including levels of employment, real disposable 
income, salaries and wage rates; (iv) consumer confidence and 
consumer perception of economic conditions; (v) retailers’ 
perception of consumer spending habits; (vi) technological 
change; (vii) exposure to possibly adverse governmental or 
regulatory actions in countries where the Group operates or 
conducts business; (viii) levels of volatility in global markets; (ix) 
exposure to the effects of economic sanctions or other restrictive 
economic measures as a result of the Group’s global presence; 
and (x) any change or development in global, national or regional 
economic and political conditions. 

For example, the Group is exposed to inflationary pressures 
and commodity prices, which generally affect the Group 
through their impact on payroll and supply costs (including 
freight). Whilst the Group may increase product prices in order 
to mitigate the impact of inflation, competitive pressures may 
constrain the Group’s ability to fully recover any increased costs 
in this way, and so the Group may remain subject to market risk 
with respect to inflationary pressures and increases in commodity 
prices. In addition, the Group’s initiatives to offset headwinds 
from inflation in input prices and commodities, including forward 
buying, value engineering and alternative supply arrangements, 
may not be sufficient to mitigate these risks. 

Relatedly, the Group is also subject to risks arising from the 
recent rapid increase of interest rates in many markets around 
the world. In particular, the Group has obligations under 
financial instruments that bear interest at floating rates, and 
borrowings under the Group’s bank financing facilities (see 
Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from page 156). 

Sustained elevated interest rates may in future increase the 
Group’s interest expenses associated with these and future debt 
obligations and thereby reduce cashflow available for other 
purposes. Any hedging arrangements entered into by the Group 
to offset this risk may prove not to be fully effective or available 
on terms that are acceptable to the Group. 

Risks related to litigation, disputes and 
regulatory investigations
The Group is, and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings, 
disputes and regulatory and governmental investigations in 
various contexts, including consumer fraud actions, competitor 
and regulatory challenges to product and marketing claims, 
competition law investigations, product liability and quality 
claims, human resources claims, contractual disputes and 
other disputes or claims arising in the ordinary course of its 
business operations. 

These legal actions, disputes and investigations may relate 
to aspects of the Group’s businesses and operations that 
are specific to the Group, or that are common to companies 
that operate in the Group’s markets, and this risk may be 
enhanced in circumstances where the Group is operating in new 
markets. Legal actions and disputes may arise under contracts, 
regulations or from a course of conduct taken by the Group, and 
may be class actions. Further information on legal proceedings 
impacting the Group are detailed in Note 22 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, on page 152. 

In connection with acquisitions, disposals or other transactions, 
the Group may enter into contractual arrangements pursuant 
to which the Group may become exposed to litigation risk 
despite not being a party to proceedings in relation to which the 
indemnities may be implicated. In connection with the separation 
as further set out below under “The Group has indemnification 
obligations in favour of the GSK Group and the Pfizer Group, 
which could be significant”, GSK and Pfizer have each served the 
Group with notice of potential claims for indemnification relating 
to OTC Zantac, the outcome of which claims is currently uncertain. 
The Group has rejected both GSK’s and Pfizer’s requests for 
indemnification on the basis that the scope of the indemnities 
set out in the joint venture agreement only covers the consumer 
healthcare businesses of GSK and Pfizer when the Consumer 
Healthcare JV was formed in 2018. 

Given the large or indeterminate amounts of damages sometimes 
sought by claimants, other sanctions that might be imposed 
(including the Group no longer being able to use key claims) 
and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and disputes, 
it is possible that an adverse outcome to any litigation, dispute, 
government or regulatory investigation could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition, 
results of operations and prospects. The Group has made 
provisions for legal disputes and matters, including amounts 
relating to legal and administrative proceedings, which we 
believe are reasonably possible (but not probable) to be realised. 
Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, it is possible that 
we might incur additional liabilities as a consequence of the 
proceedings and claims brought against us, including those 
that are not currently believed by us to be reasonably possible. 
Details of these contingencies are included within Other 
provisions as set out in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, on page 152.

Group information continued

Risk factors continued

The Group faces risks including but not limited to:

The Group faces risks associated with significant 
international operations

The Group operates on a global basis. While geographic 
diversity helps to reduce the Group’s exposure to risks in any 
one country or part of the world, it also means that the Group 
faces risks associated with significant international operations, 
including, but not limited to: exchange rate risks; regulatory 
limits on the import and export of products, or repatriation 
of earnings (including exchange and export/import controls); 
political or economic instability, geopolitical events and rising 
geopolitical trade tensions as well as social or labour unrest; 
foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential 
for nationalisation or expropriation of property or other 
resources; changes to trade policies and agreements and other 
foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including 
those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the 
imposition of and/or the increase in onerous trade restrictions, 
tariffs and/or price controls (including requirements to exclusively 
utilise local manufacturing); and changes to labour laws, travel or 
immigration restrictions. 

Any or all of the foregoing risks could adversely impact consumer 
confidence, affect the Group’s product mix and/or have a 
significant impact on the Group’s ability to sell its products on 
a competitive basis in international markets and may materially 
and adversely affect its business, prospects, results of operations 
and financial condition. 

Volatility in material and other costs could materially 
and adversely impact the Group’s profitability

Increases in the costs of and/or a reduction in the availability 
of materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients and 
excipients and raw and packaging material commodities, as well 
as labour, energy, logistics and other necessary services, such 
as those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic and in relation 
to inflationary pressures, may adversely affect the Group’s 
profit margins. If material and other cost increases continue in 
the future, the Group may be unable to pass along such higher 
costs in the form of price increases, achieve cost efficiencies, 
or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, 
ongoing productivity initiatives and the potential use of 
commodity hedging contracts. Sustained price increases may 
lead to declines in sales volumes as competitors may not adjust 
their prices or consumers may decide not to pay higher prices, 
which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share 
and could materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, 
results of operations and financial condition. 

The Group’s business may be impacted by the effects 
of regional and local conflicts

The Group monitors the effects of regional and local conflicts. 
However, the broader economic consequences of Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and other recent regional conflicts, including 
in the Middle East, continue to be difficult to predict, and the 
ongoing global geopolitical and economic instability related to 
the actions of governments relating thereto (including sanctions 
measures), the effects of which include (but are not limited to) 
changes in commodity, freight, logistics and input costs, could 
continue to adversely impact the Group’s business and/or the 
trading prices of its securities.

 — Disruption to the Group’s business operations, including 

adverse impacts on its employees and on its revenue derived 
in regions involved in conflict.

 — Foreign exchange risk relating to its revenues denominated in 

relevant currencies. For example, the Group generates revenue 
from sales of its products in Russia in Russian Rubles, and 
denominates its significant costs in other currencies, such as 
Pound Sterling, Euro and USD. Sanctions against Russia have 
increased volatility in the value of the Russian Ruble, which 
may affect the results of the Group’s operations in Russia as 
the relative value between its derived revenues and incurred 
costs fluctuates. The Group may not be able to offset any 
devaluation of such currencies through increased prices of 
its products. In addition, the imposition of exchange controls 
may limit the Group’s ability to repatriate profits from its 
operations in relevant countries.

 — Reduced demand for the Group’s products which exposes 
the Group to increased counterparty risk in relation to 
customers and receivables from customers.

 — Compliance with global sanctions regimes, and possible counter 
measures imposed in response, many of which are evolving 
rapidly and are increasingly complex to operate within.

 — Potential litigation risk from the Group’s counterparties seeking 
to assert their rights for payments that are unable to be made 
by the Group because of sanctions imposed on counterparties 
or financial institutions.

 — Reputational risks associated with the Group’s continued 

presence in certain markets. Negative publicity surrounding 
the Group’s continued presence and/or supply of products in 
countries involved in conflict could damage the Group’s brands 
and its reputation, lead to boycotts of its products outside the 
conflict region and/or have consequences on the continuation 
of operations and/or sales, including a determination by the 
Group to discontinue all sales in such countries.

 — As part of the Russian Government’s indicated plans to seize 
the assets of western companies leaving Russia, in the event 
that the Group discontinues its Russian operations, the 
potential (i) nationalisation of the Group’s Russian assets, 
(ii) devaluing of the Group’s Russian patents and trademarks 
and (iii) introduction of restrictions on, or imposition of 
unfavourable terms in respect of, payments made from 
Russia or relating to assets in Russia.

The impact of conflict remains highly uncertain and there may 
be additional risks to the Group arising out of or relating to the 
current conflicts and escalating military conflicts globally, which 
could also have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business. 

Failure to comply with regulation regarding the use of 
personal data

The Group is subject to regulations in the jurisdictions in which it 
operates regarding the use of personal data. The Group collects 
and processes personal data from its consumers, customers, 
business contacts and employees as part of the operation of its 
business, and therefore it must comply with data protection and 
privacy laws. Those laws generally impose certain requirements 
on the Group in respect of the collection, retention, use and 
processing of such personal information. Notwithstanding its 
efforts, the Group is exposed to the risk that this data could 
be wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed, retained, stolen 
or processed in breach of data protection laws.

UK as well as the increased data protection regulation in other

jurisdictions, such as China, Russia and the US, introduced the 
potential for significant new levels of fines for non-compliance 
based on turnover. As part of its ongoing compliance with 
applicable requirements, the Group may be required to expend 
significant capital or other resources and/or modify its operations 
to meet such requirements, any or a combination of which could 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial 
condition and financial results, or otherwise harm its reputation. 

The Group is exposed to risks relating to fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates and related hedging activities

The Group operates internationally and holds assets, incurs 
liabilities, generates sales and pays expenses in a variety of 
currencies other than Pound Sterling (the currency in which it reports 
its financial results). The most significant foreign currency exposures 
are to the USD, Euro, Swiss Franc and Chinese Renminbi, including 
$8,448m of USD-denominated bonds and €2,350m of Euro-
denominated bonds incurred by the Group as at 31 December 2023. 

Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have reduced 
and could continue to reduce the Pound Sterling value of sales, 
earnings and cash flows the Group receives from markets outside 
the UK, increase its supply costs (as measured in Pound Sterling) 
in those markets, negatively impact its competitiveness in those 
markets or otherwise materially and adversely impact its business 
or financial condition. The Group’s foreign currency exposure will 
be greater for so long as the leverage levels of the Group are higher 
than are reflected in the Group’s longer-term strategy, the success 
of which cannot be guaranteed. The Group aims to manage this 
risk through hedging where possible and practical; however, such 
hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than 
a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from variations 
to such rates. The Group is also exposed to counterparty credit 
(or repayment) risk under hedging contracts. To the extent 
any hedging activities of the Group are wholly or partially 
ineffective, or to the extent a hedging counterparty fails to meet 
its obligations under any hedging agreement, this could result in 
losses which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Determinations made by the Group with respect to the 
application of tax law may result in challenges from or disputes 
with tax authorities which result in the payment of additional 
amounts for tax

The worldwide nature of the Group’s operations means that the 
Group is subject to the tax laws in each country in which it operates. 
Tax laws are complex and on occasion are subject to interpretation 
by Haleon and the relevant fiscal authorities, such that this may 
result in conflict and creates the risk of double taxation. 

Additionally, the Group is subject to many different forms 
of taxation within any given jurisdiction in which it operates 
(including, but not limited to, corporate income taxes, capital 
gains taxes on direct or indirect transfers of ownership, stamp 
duty and similar transfer taxes, value added taxes, property 
taxes and social security and other payroll taxes). The global 
tax environment across all taxes continues to change rapidly 
creating further complexity and uncertainty. This means that 
the Group may be subject to domestic and cross-border tax 
authority disputes in the future, which could result in the payment 
of additional amounts of tax. Such potential disputes and the 
resulting payment obligations could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s business, results of operations and financial 
condition. At 31 December 2023, the Group had recognised 
provisions of £148 million in respect of uncertain tax positions.

Changes in the tax systems of the countries in which the Group 
operates could adversely affect the Group’s financial condition 
and results of operations

Many countries, including the ones in which the Group operates, 
change their tax laws from time to time, including by legislation, 
regulation, administrative practice, judicial action or entering into 
or amending tax treaties. The Group’s financial condition and 
results of operations may be adversely affected by such changes. 
For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and 
Development’s base erosion and profit shifting project and Pillar 
Two regime, which is focused on establishing a global minimum 
corporate taxation rate, has caused or is anticipated to cause 
changes in the tax laws of many countries in which the Group 
operates, and it is estimated that Pillar Two will increase the 
adjusted effective tax rate of the Group by less than 1%. Similarly, 
the US Government routinely proposes changes to US tax laws, and 
such changes, including any expansion of the scope of the US anti-
inversion rules, could also adversely affect the Group’s tax profile. 

Risks relating to separation of its business from GSK
The Group has indemnification obligations in favour of the GSK 
Group and the Pfizer Group, which could be significant

The Group, GSK, and Pfizer, entered into the Pfizer Stock and Asset 
Purchase Agreement (Pfizer SAPA) on 19 December 2018 pursuant 
to which the Group, GSK, and Pfizer agreed to form a new global 
consumer healthcare joint venture. The Pfizer SAPA, as amended 
from time to time, including by the Pfizer SAPA Amendment 
Agreement, contains certain cross indemnities among the Group, 
the GSK Group and the Pfizer Group. Among other provisions, the 
Group is required to indemnify the GSK Group and Pfizer Group in 
respect of “Purchaser Liabilities” and “Assumed Liabilities.” GSK 
and Pfizer have each served the Group with notice of potential 
claims under the relevant indemnification provisions in the 
Pfizer SAPA in relation to possible liabilities connected with OTC 
Zantac which the Group has rejected (see Legal proceedings in 
Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on page 152). 
It is not possible, at this stage, to meaningfully assess whether the 
outcome will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably 
estimate what liability (if any) the Group may have to GSK and/or 
Pfizer under the relevant indemnities. 

In addition the Group has entered into a tax covenant with GSK and 
Pfizer on 1 June 2022 (the Tax Covenant), effective from the time 
of the Demerger. The Tax Covenant contains certain indemnities 
(subject to certain financial and other limitations) in respect of 
taxation given from GSK and Pfizer to Haleon (and vice versa).

If any amounts payable by the Group under these indemnities (or 
additional taxes imposed on the Group that are not indemnified 
by GSK and/or Pfizer under the Tax Covenant) are substantial, this 
could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, 
results of operations and/or prospects of the Group. 

The Tax Covenant will restrict the Company’s ability to engage 
in certain transactions

The Tax Covenant imposes certain restrictions on the Company 
which largely fall away from July 2024. For example, there are 
restrictions on certain asset disposals as well as on certain internal 
restructuring transactions (including liquidations or the issuance or 
redemption of stock or debt of certain subsidiaries of the Company). 
Although the Company does not currently anticipate that these 
restrictions would have a material adverse impact on the Company, 
these restrictions may reduce the Company’s ability to engage in 
certain business transactions that otherwise might be advantageous, 
until July 2024 when the majority of such restrictions fall away.

Articles of Association

The Articles of Association, adopted on 31 May 2022, contain 
(amongst others) provisions to the following effect. Any amendment 
requires the approval of shareholders by a special resolution at 
a general meeting. The Company’s objects are unrestricted. 

Directors
The Board has the authority to manage the business of the 
Company, for example, through powers to issue and repurchase its 
shares, subject where required to shareholder resolutions. Subject 
to certain exceptions, the Directors do not have power to vote at 
Board meetings on matters in which they have a material interest. 

The Company by ordinary resolution, or the Board, may appoint 
any person permitted by law to do so and willing to act to be a 
Director. In addition to any power of removal under legislation, 
the Company may by special resolution remove a Director before 
the expiration of their period of office and may (subject to the 
Articles) by ordinary resolution appoint another person as a 
Director in their place. All Directors must retire from office at 
the AGM each year and may offer themselves for re-election. 

Rights and restrictions
The liability of shareholders is limited to the amount, if any, 
unpaid on the ordinary shares held by them.

Subject to any rights attached to existing shares, the Company 
may issue (i) shares with such rights and restrictions as the 
Company may by ordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no 
such resolution or so far as it does not make specific provision) 
as the Board may decide and (ii) redeemable shares, and the 
Board may determine the terms and conditions applied to shares 
so issued. Such rights, restrictions, terms and conditions apply 
to the relevant shares as if they were set out in the Articles. 

Shareholders are entitled to vote at a general meeting or 
class meeting on a poll. Any resolution put to a vote at a 
general meeting of the Company shall be decided on a poll. 
The Companies Act and the Articles provide that on a poll 
every shareholder has one vote per ordinary share held and 
a shareholder may vote in person or by one or more proxies. 
The proxies appointed by them taken together have the same 
voting rights as the shareholder could exercise in person. In the 
case of joint holders, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote is 
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders 
and seniority is determined by the order in which the names 
stand in the register. Non-voting preference shares do not confer 
any right to vote at a general meeting. Non-voting preference 
shareholders are, however, entitled to vote at any class meeting 
of non-voting preference shareholders. 

A shareholder is not entitled to vote any share held by them 
at any general or class meeting if any call or other sum then 
payable remains unpaid or if that shareholder has been served 
with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) after failure 
to provide the Company with information concerning interests in 
those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act. 

Dividends
The Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends not 
exceeding the amount recommended by the Board. Subject to 
the Companies Act, the Board may pay dividends whenever the 
financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, 
justifies its payment. 

The non-voting preference shares rank pari passu with all other 
non-voting preference shares and have preferential dividend 
rights ahead of the ordinary shares, entitling holders to quarterly 
cumulative dividends at a fixed rate of 9.5% per annum for five 
years from the date of the issue, following which the rate shall be 
reset for each subsequent period of five consecutive years at the 
rate equal to the Bank of England base rate prevailing at the time 
of reset plus 7.5%. Dividends on the non-voting preference shares 
which have become payable are required to be paid in full before 
any repurchases or distributions can be made with respect to the 
ordinary shares. 

Any dividend unclaimed after a period of six years from the date it 
was declared or became due for payment is forfeited and reverts 
to the Company unless the Board decides otherwise. 

The Board may decide how dividends or other money payable in 
cash relating to a share are paid. If shareholders fail to provide 
the necessary details to enable payment, or if payment cannot be 
made using the details provided by the shareholder, the dividend 
or other amount payable will be treated as unclaimed. 

Rights on a winding up
The non-voting preference shares carry preferential rights to 
participate in a distribution of capital in the event of insolvency 
(including on a winding-up) up to an amount equal to their 
nominal value plus accrued dividend and any arrears or deficiency 
in amount of the cumulative dividend. The ordinary shares do not 
carry any rights to participate in a capital distribution (including 
on a liquidation) other than those that exist as a matter of law. 
Under the Companies Act, upon a liquidation, after the claims of 
creditors have been satisfied and subject to any special rights 
attaching to any other class of shares in the Company (including 
the non-voting preference shares), surplus assets (if any) are 
distributed among the shareholders in proportion to the number 
and nominal amounts of their ordinary shares. 

Redemption of non-voting preference shares
Each non-voting preference share is redeemable in whole at the 
option of the Company or each relevant shareholder in respect 
of its entire holding on any date falling not less than five years 
after the date on which that share was issued or, if earlier, on the 
Company undergoing a change of control. 

General meetings
The Company is required to give at least 21 days’ notice of a 
general meeting unless a special resolution reducing the period 
to not less than 14 days has been passed at the immediately 
preceding AGM. 

The Board may decide to allow persons entitled to attend 
and participate in a general meeting to do so by simultaneous 
attendance and participation by means of an electronic facility 
with no member necessarily in physical attendance at the 
electronic meeting, and to permit Directors or others to attend 
and speak, and the chair of the meeting to preside, by electronic 
means. Shareholders present in person or by proxy by means of 
such electronic facility will be counted in the quorum for, and be 
entitled to participate in, the relevant general meeting. 

Restrictions in respect of designated persons
The Company can apply restrictions and take certain actions in 
relation to its shares where the Company believes the holder is or 
may be designated as a sanctioned person by certain authorities 
(including the UK, US, EU or any respective governmental 
institutions) or where it would be unlawful by virtue of any 
applicable sanctions laws. 

Group information

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

203

Group information continued

Additional laws, regulations and other requirements materially 
relevant to the Group’s business include:

 — Claims and labelling. The labelling and advertising for all 

product classifications which the Group markets is subject to 
applicable laws in markets in which the Group operates, which 
may specify text format and the order of information, require 
specific information and statements, and restrict misleading, 
unfair or unsubstantiated claims in advertisements and on 
labels. Regulatory authorities may take enforcement action 
against businesses which fail to comply with relevant rules. 

 — Pricing. The Group’s activities are also subject to price 

control laws and regulations in some of the markets in which 
it operates. For example, in China, in respect of medicines 
(both Rx and OTC) in the hospital channel, the government 
regulates prices through a centralised procurement mechanism, 
medical insurance reimbursement standards and strengthened 
regulation of medical and pricing practices. 

 — Consumer safety and quality. The Group is subject to vigilance 

regulations designed to ensure the safety of its products, 
whether in the development pipeline, already approved, 
or post-launch. These regulations require the collection, 
detection, assessment, monitoring and prevention of adverse 
events/undesirable effects, through (among other things) 
inspection by health authorities, reporting of serious safety 
events, and preparation of periodic safety reports. The Group 
is also subject to quality regulations that apply to innovation, 
manufacturing practices, testing, marketing, post-marketing 
studies and reporting by product classification. These regulations 
can require pre- and post-approval inspections of facilities 
to ensure good manufacturing practice compliance, and the 
imposition of quality systems regulations on medical devices. 

Exchange controls and restrictions on payment 
of dividends

Other than certain economic sanctions in force from time to 
time, there are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations 
in the UK restricting the import or export of capital or affecting 
the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to 
non-resident holders of ordinary shares or ADRs. There are 
no limitations under English law or the Articles on the right of 
non-resident or foreign owners to be the registered holders of, 
or to exercise voting rights in, ordinary shares or ADRs. 

Impact of regulation

The Group’s activities are subject to regulation on a local and 
international level that impact the Group’s activities. The majority 
of the Group’s products can be categorised according to four 
principal regulatory classifications: OTC medicines; medical devices; 
foods; and cosmetics. Each is subject to regulatory regimes that 
restrict research, development, manufacturing, testing, marketing 
and sale of the Group’s products, and the process of obtaining 
regulatory approvals and ongoing compliance with applicable laws, 
regulations and other requirements necessitate the expenditure 
of substantial time and financial resources, which can increase 
the cost and complexity of the Group’s business (see, for example, 
The Group may not be able to develop and commercialise new 
products effectively in the Risk Factors section on page 193). 

In the US, the FDA is our principal regulator and we must also 
comply with regulations promulgated by other federal and 
state authorities. In the EU, the regulatory system is based on 
a network of national competent authorities in the European 
Economic Area, working together with the European Medicines 
Agency and the European Commission. In China, the National 
Medical Products Administration (and affiliated institutions) is 
the primary regulator supervising and regulating drugs, medical 
devices and cosmetics. 

 — OTC medicines. OTC medicines are regulated according to 
guidelines and standards published by the International 
Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. The requirements govern, 
among other things, pre-clinical and clinical testing, pre- and 
post-marketing approval, production, distribution, import, 
export, and advertising. Failure to comply can result in recalls, 
seizures, injunctions, refusal or withdrawal of approval of 
products, fines or criminal prosecution. 

 — Medical devices. All medical devices must satisfy safety 
and performance, quality system (some low-risk devices 
may be exempt) and labelling requirements, with the 
degree of regulatory scrutiny increasing with the potential 
risks of the medical device. Regulatory controls on medical 
devices, including pre-market authorisation requirements, 
may require the provision of stringent supporting material, 
including (among other things) independent external audits 
of the manufacturer’s quality systems, independent external 
review of the technical data and documentation of relevant 
clinical evidence to support the manufacturer’s claims.
 — Food. Most food products do not require pre-market 

authorisation, although specific categories (such as food 
supplements, foods for special medical purposes or dietary 
supplements) may require notification of sale to regulators. 
In some countries, such as China, products classified as 
functional health foods require a formal pre-market review 
and registration. Products in this category are subject to 
strict quality and safety standards, including for packaging 
and product composition. 

 — Cosmetics. Cosmetics can be classified differently by territory: 

a cosmetic in one country may be classified as a medicine, 
or even a medical device, in another country (e.g., fluoride 
toothpaste is a cosmetic in the EU and a drug in the US). Some 
countries require pre-market approval involving the provision 
of safety assessments, manufacturing data and raw material 
functionality, while other countries require no registration.

Pfizer Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement
Pursuant to a stock and asset purchase agreement dated  
19 December 2018 and amended and restated on 31 July 
2019 (the Pfizer SAPA), GSK, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline

relating to tax, which were subject to a separate regime – see 
below) relating to certain liabilities that the parties agreed would

defined as follows: “Purchaser Liabilities” means any and all 
liabilities (other than certain specified exceptions – including 
those liabilities GSK agreed to indemnify the Group in respect 
of, as summarised above) of GSK or any of its affiliates, whether

“Assumed Liabilities” means any and all liabilities (other than 
certain specified exceptions – including those liabilities Pfizer 
agreed to indemnify the Group in respect of, as summarised 
above) of Pfizer or any of its affiliates, whether arising prior to, 
on or after Pfizer Completion, to the extent resulting from or 
arising out of the past, present or future ownership, operation, 
use or conduct of the Business, where “Business” has the 
meaning described above under “Pfizer Stock and Asset Purchase 
Agreement—Asset Perimeter: Pfizer Contributed CH Business”. 

Separation Co-operation and Implementation 
Agreement
The Separation Co-operation and Implementation Agreement 
(the SCIA) was entered into on 1 June 2022 among GSK, Pfizer, 
CH JVCo and the Company, among others, and details certain 
actions that were to be taken and arrangements that were to be 
implemented to effect completion of, or which otherwise relate 
to, the Separation. The SCIA records the obligations of the parties 
relating to such matters and contains certain terms on which 
relations between the parties are governed following completion 
of the Separation. 

The Pfizer SAPA Amendment Agreement also extends the Group’s 
indemnification obligations in favour of GSK and Pfizer to include, 
among other things, all losses (other than losses relating to tax, 
which were subject to a separate regime (see below)) relating to 
liabilities to the extent resulting from or arising out of the past, 
present or future ownership, operation, use or conduct of the 
consumer healthcare business since Pfizer Completion, subject to 
certain exceptions (see Pfizer SAPA Amendment Agreement below). 

In respect of tax, each of GSK and Pfizer provided an indemnity, 
subject to customary exclusions and limitations, to the Group in 
respect of, among other things, tax liabilities of the companies 
contributed to the GSK/Pfizer JV arising up to the point of 
Pfizer Completion. 

The indemnities provided by each of GSK, Pfizer and the Group 
under the Pfizer SAPA survived completion of the Demerger 
and Separation. 

Pfizer SAPA Amendment Agreement
On 1 June 2022, GSK, Pfizer, CH JVCo and the Company entered 
into the second amendment agreement to the Pfizer SAPA (the 
Pfizer SAPA Amendment Agreement) to implement certain 
amendments, including: (i) amendments to the Pfizer SAPA 
that were deemed appropriate as a result of the Group being 
an independent, separate business from GSK and Pfizer from 
Separation; (ii) amendments that were deemed appropriate as 
a result of an overlap with certain other ancillary agreements 
that are currently being entered into as part of the Separation; 
and (iii) to include the Company in the Pfizer SAPA indemnity 
framework by way of a guarantee given by the Company of 
CH JVCo’s indemnification obligations under the Pfizer SAPA. 

Pursuant to the Pfizer SAPA Amendment Agreement: (i) the 
Group’s indemnification obligations under the Pfizer SAPA (as 
described under Pfizer Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement— 
Indemnities on the previous page), were extended to include, 
among other things, all losses (other than losses relating to tax, 
which were subject to a separate regime) relating to liabilities 
to the extent resulting from or arising out of the past, present 
or future ownership, operation, use or conduct of the consumer 
healthcare business since Pfizer Completion, subject to certain 
exceptions primarily related to liabilities retained by each of 
Pfizer and GSK, respectively, under the Pfizer SAPA; and (ii) the 
Company, which is deemed a ‘Purchaser Indemnified Party’ 
under the Pfizer SAPA and has the benefit of the indemnities 
given to CH JVCo under the Pfizer SAPA, has provided a 
guarantee of CH JVCo’s indemnity obligations under the Pfizer 
SAPA (as described under Pfizer Stock and Asset Purchase 
Agreement— Indemnities on the previous page), as amended 
by the Pfizer SAPA Amendment Agreement.

The Pfizer SAPA Amendment Agreement also includes provisions 
related to the release of guarantees given by Pfizer for the benefit 
of companies in the Group (or vice versa).

The SCIA also sets out certain other rights and obligations of 
the parties relating to, among other things, information rights 
and confidentiality. Pursuant to the terms of the SCIA, Pfizer has 
certain rights to certain information regarding the Company and 
the Group. Subject to certain exceptions, those rights will not 
apply if and when Pfizer and members of Pfizer’s group cease 
to hold, in aggregate, Haleon ordinary shares or Haleon ADSs in 
respect of such Haleon shares representing at least 10% of the 
Haleon shares in issue (or the ordinary shares of any ultimate 
holding company thereof from time to time). 

Tax Covenant
In accordance with the SCIA, the Company, GSK and Pfizer, among 
others, entered into a tax covenant on 1 June 2022, which has 
been effective from the time of the Demerger (the Tax Covenant).
Subject to certain financial and other customary limitations, the 
Tax Covenant contains certain indemnities in respect of taxation 
given from GSK and Pfizer to the Company (and vice versa) where 
it has been agreed that such taxes are properly allocable to the 
indemnifying party. Amongst other things, GSK and Pfizer have 
provided the Company with indemnities for tax arising (if any) 
pursuant to certain pre-demerger reorganisation steps within 
the Group and the steps which comprised the Separation. As is 
customary for demerger transactions, the Company has provided 
a more limited set of tax indemnities to GSK and Pfizer. 

The Tax Covenant also imposes certain restrictions on the Company, 
which largely fall away from July 2024. For example, there are 
restrictions on certain asset disposals as well as on certain 
internal restructuring transactions (including liquidations or the 
issuance or redemption of stock or debt of certain subsidiaries 
of the Company). Although the Company does not currently 
anticipate that these restrictions would have a material adverse 
impact on the Company, these restrictions may reduce the 
Company’s ability to engage in certain business transactions 
that otherwise might be advantageous, until July 2024 when 
the majority of such restrictions fall away. 

Exchange Agreements
Subject to and shortly after completion of the demerger, a series 
of share-for-share exchanges occurred pursuant to certain share 
exchange agreements in order to rationalise the Company’s 
shareholding structure such that GSK, the Scottish Limited 
Partnerships (SLPs) and Pfizer hold their remaining interests 
in the consumer healthcare business by holding shares in the 
Company, as the listed parent company. 

Pfizer Exchange Agreement
On 1 June 2022, Pfizer and the Company, among others, entered 
into an exchange agreement pursuant to which Pfizer transferred 
all of its interests in the company that held 32% of the ordinary 
shares in the Group prior to separation to the Company in 
exchange for the issuance by the Company of Haleon ordinary 
shares to Pfizer and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A. (as depositary 
on behalf of Pfizer), representing in aggregate 32% of the issued 

206

and outstanding Haleon ordinary shares immediately following 
separation (to the nearest whole Haleon ordinary share), and 
25 million non-voting preference shares. 

Following completion of these transactions, the Company 
indirectly owned 100% of the Group.

Pfizer Relationship Agreement 
The relationship agreement between the Company and 
Pfizer was entered into as a deed on 1 June 2022 (the Pfizer 
Relationship Agreement). The principal purpose of the Pfizer 
Relationship Agreement is to regulate the continuing relationship 
between the Company and Pfizer after Admission. References 
to aggregate interests in Haleon ordinary shares in the Pfizer 
Relationship Agreement include both direct holdings of Haleon 
ordinary shares and interests in Haleon ordinary shares held 
indirectly through holdings of Haleon ADSs. 

Pursuant to the Pfizer Relationship Agreement, Pfizer has 
undertaken, that, for so long as Pfizer is a controlling shareholder 
(as defined in Appendix I to the Listing Rules), it shall (and shall 
procure that its associates (as defined in Appendix I of the Listing 
Rules) shall): (i) conduct all transactions and arrangements 
with the Company and the Group at arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms; (ii) not take any action that would have 
the effect of preventing the Company from complying with its 
obligations under the Listing Rules; and (iii) not propose or 
procure the proposal of a shareholder resolution of the Company 
which is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the 
proper application of the Listing Rules. For so long as Pfizer is a 
controlling shareholder, it shall (and shall, so far as it is legally 
able to do so, procure that its associates shall) not take any action 
which precludes the Company or any other member of the Group 
from carrying on an independent business as its main activity. 

Under the Pfizer Relationship Agreement, Pfizer is granted the 
right to nominate two persons to be appointed to the Board 
as representative directors for so long as it and its affiliates 
together continue to hold 20% or more of the Haleon ordinary 
shares in issue and a right to nominate one person to be 
appointed to the Board as a representative director for so long 
as it and its affiliates together continue to hold less than 20% 
but at least 10% of the Haleon ordinary shares in issue. Pfizer 
is subject to customary standstill provisions, subject to certain 
exceptions, and the Pfizer Relationship Agreement imposes 
certain obligations on the Company in connection with seeking 
shareholder authority to carry out share repurchases to ensure 
that no such repurchases result in a requirement for Pfizer to 
make a general offer for Haleon ordinary shares in accordance 
with Rule 9 of the City Code (provided that Pfizer has not itself 
entered into any disqualifying transactions). 

Under the Pfizer Relationship Agreement, Pfizer agrees to procure 
that any member of its group that held an interest in Haleon 
ordinary shares on Admission shall, for such time as that member 
of Pfizer’s group holds an interest in Haleon ordinary shares, 
comply with the provisions of the Pfizer Relationship Agreement 
as if that member of Pfizer’s group were a party to the Pfizer 
Relationship Agreement with the same obligations as Pfizer. 

The Pfizer Relationship Agreement will terminate on the date 
that Pfizer and its affiliates cease to hold at least 10% of the 
Haleon ordinary shares in issue.

Registration Rights Agreement
The Registration Rights Agreement (the Registration Rights 
Agreement) was entered into on 1 June 2022 among the 
Company, Pfizer, GSK and the SLPs. GSK, Pfizer and the SLPs, 
together with their respective affiliates, successors or permitted 
assigns, to the extent they are holders or beneficial owners 
of the Company’s registrable securities, are referred to in the 
Registration Rights Agreement as “Holders”. The Company’s 
registrable securities include all shares and ADSs held by the 
Holders in the Company after Separation and equity securities 
issued in exchange or replacement thereof. 

The Registration Rights Agreement provides for certain demand 
and piggyback registration rights to the Holders. The Company 
filed a shelf registration statement on Form F-1 (the Shelf 
Registration Agreement) on 28 July 2022 in partial satisfaction 
of the demand registration rights. Additionally, pursuant to the 
demand registration rights: (i) following the expiration of the 
lock-up restrictions in the Lock-up Deed, each Holder now has the 
right to sell any part of its registrable securities in an underwritten 
offering pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (the Shelf 
Underwriting) by delivering a written request to the Company. 
The Company shall give notice of such request to the Holders of 
other registrable securities registered on the Shelf Registration 
Statement, and, subject to certain limitations, include in the Shelf 
Underwriting the registrable securities of the other requesting 
Holders; (ii) if the Shelf Registration Statement is not available for 
use by the Holders, each Holder may require the Company to file 
one or more registration statements covering all or any part of its 
registrable securities, subject to certain limitations. The Company 
shall use its reasonable best efforts to file or confidentially 
submit with the SEC such registration statement no later than 
60 days from receipt of request from the Holder if the registration 
is on Form F-1 or Form S-1 (or 30 days if the registration is on 
Form F-3 or Form S-3); and (iii) the Registration Rights Agreement 
includes customary provisions that permit the Company to 
postpone filing or confidentially submitting a registration 
statement, or if a registration statement has been filed or 
confidentially submitted, suspend use of, or withdraw, such 
registration statement for a limited duration to avoid disclosing 
material non-public information in certain circumstances. 

The Holders also have certain ‘piggyback’ registration rights, 
pursuant to which they will be entitled to register the resale 
of their registrable securities alongside certain offerings of 
securities that the Company may undertake, subject to “cutback” 
in certain such cases. 

The Registration Rights Agreement contains customary 
indemnification obligations on the part of the Company and, 
in certain circumstances, the Holders. 

The Company is obligated to pay all expenses associated with the 
registration of the registrable securities under the Registration 
Rights Agreement, except for transfer taxes and commissions 
payable in an underwritten offering (payable by the Holders). 

The Registration Rights Agreement terminates with regards to 
the Holders affiliated with GSK and the Holders affiliated with 
Pfizer when they, respectively, cease to hold registrable securities 
representing more than 1% of Haleon’s outstanding ordinary shares.

Summary of significant corporate governance 
differences from NYSE listing standards

The Group’s statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued in July 2018 by the Financial Reporting 
Council (the Code) is set out on page 96. 

The Company’s ADSs are listed on the NYSE and we are subject 
to the reporting and other requirements of the SEC applicable 
to US foreign private issuers. We are required to disclose any 
significant ways in which our corporate governance practices 
differ from those followed by US companies under the Listing 
Standards of the NYSE. 

The significant differences between Haleon’s corporate 
governance practices as a UK company and those required 
by NYSE standards for US companies are as follows. 

Independence
The Code’s principles recommend that at least half the Board, 
excluding the Chair, should consist of independent non-executive 
directors. As at 7 March 2024, the Board consisted of the Chair, 
independent at the time of his appointment, two Executive 
Directors, six Independent Non-Executive Directors and two 
Non-Executive Directors who were nominated to the Board 
by Pfizer. The Pfizer-nominated Directors are not considered 
independent. NYSE listing rules applicable to US companies 
state that companies must have a majority of independent 
directors. The NYSE has set out six bright line tests for director 
independence. The Board’s judgement is that, with the 
exception of the Pfizer-nominated Non-Executive Directors, 
the Non-Executive Directors are independent and, as such, 
Independent Non-Executive Directors make up a majority of 
the Board. However, it did not explicitly take into consideration 
the NYSE’s tests in reaching this determination. 

Committees
The Company has a number of Board Committees which are 
similar in purpose and constitution to those required for domestic 
companies under NYSE rules. The NYSE requires US companies to 
have audit, remuneration and nominating/corporate governance 
committees composed entirely of independent directors, as 
defined under the NYSE rules. The Company’s Nominations & 
Governance, Audit & Risk, and Remuneration Committees consist 
entirely of Non-Executive Directors who are independent under 
the standards of the Code, which may not necessarily be the 
same as the NYSE independence standards. The nominating/
governance committee is responsible for identifying individuals 
qualified to become members of the Board and to recommend 
to the Board a set of corporate governance principles. As the 
Company is subject to the Code, the Company’s Nominations 
& Governance Committee is responsible for nominating, for 
approval by the Board, candidates for appointment to the Board 
and its Committees. The Company’s Nominations & Governance 
Committee consists of the Chair and Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chair of the Company is not a member of either the 
Remuneration or Audit & Risk Committees. As set out on page 72, 
the Audit & Risk Committee is chaired by Deirdre Mahlan, an 
Independent Non-Executive Director, who, in the Board’s view, 
has the experience and qualifications to satisfy the criterion 
under US rules for an ‘audit committee financial expert’. 

Shareholder approval of equity compensation plans
The NYSE rules for US companies require that shareholders must 
be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation 
plans and material revisions to those plans. Haleon complies with 
UK requirements that are similar to the NYSE rules. The Board, 
however, does not explicitly take into consideration the NYSE’s 
detailed definition of what are considered ‘material revisions’.

Purchases of equity securities by the Company and affiliated purchasers
During the financial year ended 31 December 2023, the following ordinary shares (including ordinary shares held indirectly through 
Haleon ADSs) were purchased by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trusts. No shares were repurchased by the Company.

J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the Depositary for the Company’s ADR programme. The Company’s ADSs are listed on the NYSE. 
Ordinary shares representing the Company’s ADR programme, which is managed by the Depositary, are registered in the name of 
Guaranty Nominees Limited. 

As at 7 March 2024, (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Annual Report) Guaranty Nominees Limited held 
1,595,245,726 ordinary shares representing approximately 17.26% of the Company’s issued share capital.

As at the latest practicable date, the number of holders of ordinary shares in the US was 853 with holdings of 874,591 ordinary shares, 
and the number of registered holders of ADSs was 15,580 with holdings of 797,614,464 ADSs. Certain of these ordinary shares and 
ADSs were held by brokers or other nominees. As a result, the number of holders of record or registered holders in the US is not 
representative of the number of beneficial holders or of the residence of beneficial holders.

Tax information for shareholders
A summary of certain UK tax and US federal income tax 
consequences for holders of shares and ADSs who are citizens 
of the UK or the US is set out below. It is not a complete analysis 
of all the possible tax consequences of the purchase, ownership 
or sale of these securities. It is intended only as a general guide. 
Holders are advised to consult their advisers with respect to the tax 
consequences of the purchase, ownership or sale of their shares or 
ADSs and the consequences under state and local tax laws in the US 
and the implications of the current UK/US tax conventions. 

Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
UK stamp duty and/or stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) will, subject 
to certain exemptions, be payable on the transfer of shares at a 
rate of 0.5% (rounded up to the nearest £5 in the case of stamp 
duty) of the consideration for the transfer. Notwithstanding this, 
provided that an instrument is executed in pursuance of the 
agreement that gave rise to the charge to SDRT and that instrument 
is stamped within six years of the agreement (including being 
stamped as exempt) any SDRT charge should be cancelled and 
any SDRT which has already been paid will be repaid. 

US holders of ADSs generally will be treated as the owners of the 
underlying shares for the purposes of the current UK/US double 
taxation conventions relating to income and gains (Income 
Tax Convention), estate and gift taxes (Estate and Gift Tax 
Convention), and for the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986, as amended. 

UK stamp duty and/or SDRT will, subject to certain exemptions, 
be payable on any transfer of shares to the ADS custodian or 
depositary at a rate of 1.5% of the amount of any consideration 
provided (if transferred on sale), or their value (if transferred for 
no consideration). However, no stamp duty or SDRT should be 
payable on the transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS. 

UK shareholders
This summary only applies to a UK resident shareholder that 
holds shares as capital assets.

Taxation of dividends
For the 2023/2024 UK tax year, UK resident individuals are 
entitled to a dividend tax allowance of up to £1,000, so that the 
first £1,000 of dividends received in a tax year will be free of tax. 
Dividends in excess of this allowance will be taxed at 8.75% for 
basic rate taxpayers, 33.75% for higher rate taxpayers and 39.35% 
for additional rate taxpayers. 

UK resident shareholders that are corporation taxpayers should 
note that dividends payable on ordinary shares are generally 
entitled to exemption from corporation tax provided certain 
conditions are met. 

Taxation of capital gains
UK resident shareholders may be liable for UK tax on gains on the 
disposal of shares or ADSs.

For disposals by individuals in the 2023/2024 UK tax year, a 
taxable capital gain accruing on a disposal of shares or ADSs 
will be taxed at 10% for basic rate taxpayers, or 20% if, after all 
allowable deductions, the individual’s taxable income for the year 
exceeds the basic rate income tax banding. Note this is following 
the use of any exemptions available to the individual taxpayer 
such as the annual exempt amount. 

A disposal by corporation tax payers may give rise to a chargeable 
gain for the purposes of UK corporation tax, depending on the 
circumstances and subject to any available exemption or relief. 
Corporation tax is charged on gains at the rate of corporation tax 
applicable to that company. 

Inheritance tax
Individual (UK-domiciled or otherwise) shareholders may be 
liable to UK inheritance tax on the transfer of shares or ADSs. 
Tax may be charged on the amount by which the value of the 
shareholder’s estate is reduced as a result of any transfer by way 
of lifetime gift or other disposal at less than full market value. 
In the case of a bequest on death, tax may be charged on the 
value of the shares at the date of the shareholder’s death. If such 
a gift or other disposal were subject to both UK inheritance tax 
and US estate or gift tax, the Estate and Gift Tax Convention 
would generally provide for tax paid in the US to be credited 
against tax payable in the UK.

US shareholders
This section describes the material US federal income tax 
consequences to a US holder (as defined below) of owning shares 
or ADSs. It applies to you only if you hold your shares or ADSs 
as capital assets for tax purposes. This discussion addresses 
only US federal income taxation and does not discuss all of 
the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of 
your individual circumstances, including foreign, state or local 
tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax 
consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net 
investment income or the alternative minimum tax. This section 
does not apply to you if you are a member of a special class of 
holders subject to special rules, including: a dealer in securities, 
a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method 
of accounting for securities holdings, a tax-exempt organisation, 
a life insurance company, a person that actually or constructively 
owns 10% or more of the combined voting power of our voting 
stock or of the total value of our stock, a person that holds 
shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion 
transaction, a person that purchases or sells shares or ADSs 
as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, or a person whose 
functional currency is not the US Dollar. This section is based on 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative 
history, existing and proposed regulations, published rulings 
and court decisions, all as currently in effect, as well as on the 
Convention Between the US and the UK (the Treaty). These 
authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. 
In addition, this section is based in part upon the representations 
of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the 
Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed 
in accordance with its terms. 

You are a US holder if you are a beneficial owner of shares or 
ADSs and you are, for US federal income tax purposes: a citizen 
or resident of the US, a domestic corporation, an estate whose 
income is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its 
source, or a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision 
over the trust’s administration and one or more US persons are 
authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 

If an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for 
US federal income tax purposes holds the shares or ADSs, the 
US federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally 
depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of 
the partnership.

Sales or dispositions
If you sell or otherwise dispose of your shares or ADSs, you 
will recognise capital gain or loss for US federal income tax 
purposes equal to the difference between the US Dollar value 
of the amount that you realise and your tax basis, determined 
in US Dollars, in your shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a non-
corporate US holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where 
the property is held for more than one year. The gain or loss 
will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for 
foreign tax credit limitation purposes. 

Passive foreign investment company (PFIC) 
classification
We believe that we should not be currently classified as a 
PFIC for US federal income tax purposes and we do not expect 
to become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this 
conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and 
thus may be subject to change. It is therefore possible that we 
could become a PFIC in a future taxable year. The discussion 
above in this section assumes that we are not classified as a PFIC 
for US federal income tax purposes. 

If we were to be treated as a PFIC, any gain realised on the sale or 
other disposition of your shares or ADSs would in general not be 
treated as capital gain. Instead, you would generally be treated 
as if you had realised any gain and certain ‘excess distributions’ 
ratably over your holding period for the shares or ADSs. Amounts 
allocated to the current year and any year before we were a 
PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income and amounts allocated 
to other years would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect 
for each such year, and would be subject to an interest charge 
in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. In addition, 
dividends that you receive from us would not be eligible for the 
preferential tax rate if we were a PFIC (or treated as a PFIC with 
respect to you) either in the taxable year of the distribution or 
the preceding taxable year, but instead would be taxable at rates 
applicable to ordinary income. If you own our shares or ADSs 
during any year that we are a PFIC with respect to you, you may 
be required to file IRS Form 8621. 

You should consult your own tax adviser regarding the US federal, 
state and local tax consequences of owning and disposing of 
shares and ADSs in your particular circumstances. 

In general, and taking into account the earlier assumptions, for 
US federal income tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing 
ADSs, you will be treated as the owner of the shares represented 
by those ADRs. Exchanges of shares for ADRs, and ADRs for 
shares, generally will not be subject to US federal income tax. 

Distributions
Under the US federal income tax laws, the gross amount of any 
distribution we pay out of our current or accumulated earnings 
and profits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes), 
other than certain pro-rata distributions of our shares that 
are generally not taxable, will be treated as a dividend that is 
subject to US federal income taxation. If you are a non-corporate 
US holder, dividends that constitute qualified dividend income 
will be taxable to you at the preferential rates applicable to 
long-term capital gains provided that you hold the shares or 
ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 
60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet other holding 
period requirements. Dividends we pay with respect to the shares 
or ADSs generally will be qualified dividend income provided 
that, in the year that you receive the dividend, the shares or ADSs 
are readily tradable on an established securities market in the 
US or we are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty. Our ADSs are 
listed on the NYSE and we therefore expect that dividends on the 
ADSs will be qualified dividend income. In addition, we believe 
that we are currently eligible for the benefits of the Treaty and 
that dividends on the shares and ADS will be qualified dividend 
income on that basis, but there can be no assurance that we will 
continue to be eligible for the benefits of the Treaty. Dividends 
will generally be income from sources outside the US and will 
generally be ‘passive’ income for the purposes of computing the 
foreign tax credit allowable to you. 

The dividend is taxable to you when you, in the case of shares, 
or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, receive the dividend, 
actually or constructively. The dividend will not be eligible 
for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US 
corporations in respect of dividends received from other US 
corporations. The amount of the dividend distribution that you 
must include in your income will be the US Dollar value of the 
Sterling payments made, determined at the spot Sterling/US Dollar 
rate on the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of whether 
the payment is in fact converted into US Dollars. Generally, 
any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations 
during the period from the date the dividend is distributed to the 
date you convert the payment into US Dollars will be treated as 
ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special 
tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or loss 
generally will be income or loss from sources within the US for 
foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Distributions in excess of 
current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined 
for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non-
taxable return of capital to the extent of your basis in the shares 
or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, we do not 
expect to calculate earnings and profits in accordance with US 
federal income tax principles. Accordingly, you should expect to 
generally treat distributions we make as dividends.

Forward-looking statements

Haleon  Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023

217

Forward-looking statements

This Annual Report and Form 20-F contains certain statements that are, or may be deemed to be, ‘forward-looking statements’ 
(including for purposes of the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the US Securities 
Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act). Forward-looking statements give Haleon’s current expectations and projections about 
future events, including strategic initiatives and future financial condition and performance, and so Haleon’s actual results may differ 
materially from what is expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words 
such as “expects”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “targets”, “plans”, “intends”, “aims”, “projects”, “indicates”, “may”, “might”, “will”, “should”, 
“potential”, “could” and words of similar meaning (or the negative thereof). All statements, other than statements of historical facts, 
included in this Report are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements 
relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, delivery on strategic initiatives (including but not limited to 
acquisitions, realisations of efficiencies and responsible business goals), future performance or results of current and anticipated 
products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, dividend payments and financial results. 

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Haleon speak only as of the date they are made and are based upon the 
knowledge and information available to Haleon on the date of this Annual Report and Form 20-F. These forward-looking statements 
and views may be based on a number of assumptions and, by their nature, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and 
other factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future and/or are beyond 
Haleon’s control or precise estimate. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause Haleon’s actual results, performance 
or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed 
under Risk Factors on pages 193 to 201 of this Annual Report & Form 20-F. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be 
construed in light of such risk factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. 

Subject to our obligations under English and US law in relation to disclosure and ongoing information (including under the Market 
Abuse Regulations, the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), we undertake 
no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events 
or otherwise. You should, however, consult any additional disclosures that Haleon may make in any documents which it publishes 
and/or files with the SEC and take note of these disclosures, wherever you are located. 

No statement in this document is or is intended to be a profit forecast or profit estimate.

Useful information

Website and electronic communication
Haleon is committed to reducing the cost and environmental 
impact of producing and distributing printed documents in 
large quantities and this Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023 
has been made available to shareholders through our website 
at www.haleon.com. The Company is subject to the information 
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 applicable to 
US foreign private issuers. In accordance with these requirements, 
the Company files its Annual Report and Form 20-F and other 
related documents with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet 
site at www.sec.gov that contains reports and other information 
regarding issuers, including Haleon, that file electronically with 
the SEC. 

Ordinary share registrar
For information on a range of shareholder services, including 
enquiries concerning individual shareholdings, notification 
of a shareholder’s change of address and amalgamation of 
shareholder accounts (in order to avoid duplicate mailing of 
shareholder communications), shareholders should contact the 
Company’s Registrar, Equiniti, using the contact details below. 

Equiniti Limited,  
Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex  
BN99 6DA, UK 
+44 (0) 371 384 2227

Dividend services and bank mandate
The Company only makes dividend and other distribution 
payments into a nominated bank account. Shareholders 
must complete and return a direct payment instruction to the 
Company’s Registrar, Equiniti, in order to ensure your payments 
are received quickly and securely into your UK bank account. 

Dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)
As an alternative to receiving cash dividends, shareholders may 
choose to reinvest your dividends to buy more Haleon ordinary 
shares through the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP). A DRIP 
election form can be downloaded from www.shareview.co.uk 
or requested by contacting Equiniti using the contact details above. 

Ordinary shareholders can alternatively sign up to Equiniti’s new 
service, EQ Boost. Through this service, ordinary shareholders 
can boost cash dividends and convert them into eVouchers for 
a range of retailers. You can access further information or sign 
up for EQ Boost at www.shareview.co.uk/Clients/EQBoost 

Overseas payment service
It is also possible for overseas shareholders to have their 
dividends paid directly to their bank accounts in a local currency. 
Charges are payable for this service.

Shareholder security
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders 
have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence
