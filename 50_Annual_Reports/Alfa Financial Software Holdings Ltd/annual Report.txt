a lot of the skill in developing good systems

comes from understanding the issues and 

we have won some really prestigious new 

customers. On top of this, the Alfa culture 

has shone through in the activities in our 

communities and, in particular, the work 

initiated by the Environmental Impact team a 

few years ago culminated in our commitment 

to our net-zero journey. We therefore enter 

2024 in really good shape to continue 

our growth trajectory. 

 Q   How is the move to a subscription 

model going?

 A     It is only really in the last three years that we 
have moved to a Cloud First sales approach, 

and given the sales cycles in enterprise 

software, it can take time for the impact to 

filter through, but we are now seeing tangible 

financial evidence of our success here. 

Subscription revenues were up 16% in 2023 

driven by very strong sales of Alfa Cloud and 

growing licence revenues. TCV grew even more 

strongly, up 28%, and this shows the strength 

this will bring to our business in the future. 

thinking of ways it can be tackled, with the pure 

coding element being a relatively small piece. 

 Q   What excites you most about 2024?

 A    I am really looking forward to starting work 

with the new customers we have recently won 

and seeing what Alfa Systems 6 will bring to 

these and our existing customers. We have 

never lost a customer who implemented v5 

since it was launched in 2010 and so we 

know the benefits we can bring to our 

customers and that these relationships will 

last many years. Critical to this is a successful 

start to these projects, both with new and 

existing customers, working closely with 

them in a true spirit of partnership, delivering 

new functionality to support their business 

objectives. So 2024 will not only provide 

exciting and challenging opportunities for Alfa 

people but will provide a great platform for 

many years to come.

“ Our strategy is to continue to develop 
our software, to ensure that we meet 
and exceed customer and market needs 
as they evolve and as the regulatory and 
commercial environment continues to 
change. We believe we have the industry-
leading software and we continue to invest 
to maintain that lead.”

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther informationCEO review 

“Overall we expect 2024 revenue growth to be mid to 
high single digits driven by continuing strong growth 
in subscription. Our confidence in the outlook and 
our strategy means that we continue to invest in 
the business ahead of the expected growth.”

Andrew Denton, CEO

Strong performance
In 2023, we remained focused on 

continuing to drive the business forward, 

delivering growth and at the same time 

making strong strategic progress towards 

a subscription-based business. One of our 

differentiators is the quality of our delivery 

record, and in the year we saw a record 

of seven go-live events and a total of 35 

delivery events. We have also continued 

to develop and enhance our software and 

the launch of Alfa Systems 6 in Q4 2023, 

the sixth major version of our software, 

has been enthusiastically received by 

customers and sees ten new modules 

available for customers to implement. 

Financial performance was strong with 

that we converted two prospects into 

wins before the end of the year with Total 

Contract Value (“TCV”) growing 16% to 

£165m (2022: £143m) at 31 December 

2023. This increase in TCV has been 

driven by 28% growth in our subscription 

revenues showing how the transition to a 

subscription model is underpinning future 

revenues. The two recent wins are for 

major customers with multi-phase 

rollouts and these along with prospects 

we expect to convert in the late-stage 

pipeline will provide revenues for the 

business for years to come.

We had 19 customers (2022: 17) 

contributing revenues of more than £2m 

in the year, up from just seven in 2019. 

revenue up 9% to £102.0m (2022: £93.3m) 

We have significantly reduced our 

with particularly strong growth in 

subscription revenues, up 16%. Operating 

profit was £30.1m (2022: £29.6m) after the 

costs of investing into people as we build 

for future growth. Cash conversion was 

extremely strong at 115% (2023: 102%) 

with a high level of receipts just before 

year end and we finished the period with 

net cash of £21.8m (31 Dec 2022: £18.7m). 

We expect this very strong position to 

partially unwind in 2024, with the 

long-term average trend being c100%.

We have had a very strong pipeline for 

some time now, and it was very pleasing

customer concentration, with our top five 

customers now representing 35% of our 

revenues in 2023, compared with 61% in 

2019. Our largest customer now 

represents less than 10% of our revenues 

for the first time in over 8 years.

As expected, following very strong 

recruitment for the previous two years 

and as a result of our improved and very 

high retention rate of 97% (2022: 90%), we 

deliberately slowed recruitment in 2023. 

This was to ensure the quality of the 
experience for new joiners as we 

consolidate experience levels within 

the team as a whole. Headcount at

The Company received two approaches

in multi-tenant SaaS models. One of the 

big benefits of this approach is that 

customers can control their release cycles 

rather than having a timetable dictated to 

them. We mitigate the extra cost from this 

approach by encouraging customers to 

share branches and release dates. 

Our hosted services are ISO 27001 and ISO 

27018 certified and SOC1 and SOC2 

audited to confirm compliance with 

controls around data security and 

availability. Given the mission-critical

following which we decided to align our 

ambitions with those of the Science Based 

Target initiative (SBTi). We submitted our 

targets to SBTi and had them validated. 

We have formally committed to reducing 

our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 

42% by 2030, along with a commitment 

to achieve net-zero by 2050, which entails 

at least a 90% reduction in emissions 

with the remainder offset by carbon 

removal credits. 

Strategic progress
Alfa is a leading asset finance software 

company with global scale. Our software 

platform, Alfa Systems, is the world’s 

leading asset finance software, and has 

been supporting some of the world’s 

largest and most innovative companies 

for more than 30 years.

Our vision is to grow our Company and 

grow our impact faster than headcount, 

always retaining our underlying culture. 

Key to achieving this is delivering more 

concurrent Alfa implementations, more 

efficiently with our world-class Alfa 

Systems product. We will have a big 

company impact, but a small company feel.

Subscription – Strong growth in 
subscription revenues and TCV
Alfa has been on a journey transitioning 

from the on-premise perpetual licence 

environment to a subscription-based 

Cloud model. In 2017 we started to offer 

Alfa Cloud, a hosted solution and in 2020 

won our first Alfa Start customer, which 

has the benefit of the speed of 

implementation of a pre-configured 

system hosted in Alfa Cloud paid for on a 

subscription basis. The demand from all 

customers for a subscription-based Alfa 

Cloud solution, incorporating the 

automated monitoring, patching, 

scheduling and security features, has 

increased since then with all of the wins in 

2023 being subscription-based Alfa Cloud 

solutions. Looking forwards 90% of our 

late-stage pipeline are looking to adopt 

Alfa Cloud and all new customers are 

looking for a subscription-based pricing 

model. We are seeing the strongest 

growth in our revenues from the 

Subscription revenue stream and expect 

this to continue as momentum builds.

We have a single-tenant SaaS solution. 

We and our customers benefit from a 

single standard code-set and database, 

but with multi-layer data segregation as 

having such third-party verification of our 

compliance with these standards is a key 

selling point. 

Subscription revenues grew strongly in 

the period, up 16%, with TCV increasing 

28%. The growth in revenues was 

particularly strong from Alfa Cloud 

supplemented by a growing licence base. 

All customers upgrading from v4 to v5 

have moved to Alfa Cloud. We have 13 

customers using Alfa Cloud for their live 

production environments and have 

another 3 customers taking hosting 

services during the design and 

implementation phase. Maintenance 

revenues also grew strongly with the 

benefit of price rises and also from the 

net increase in live customers.

Software – Exciting roadmap 
of development 
Software revenue for the year was down 

4% on 2022. Following a very strong first 

half of customer funded development days, 

in the second half, we saw a reduction as 

attention moved towards investment for 

the launch of Alfa Systems 6. 

Our strategy is to continue to develop our 

software, to ensure that we meet and 

exceed customer and market needs as 

they evolve and as the regulatory and 

commercial environment continues to 

change. We believe we have the industry 

leading software and we continue to 

invest to increase that lead, through a

Our main mechanism for returning capital 

is the payment of a regular dividend, and 

our policy is to grow this progressively. In 

the year we paid an ordinary dividend of 

1.2 pence or £3.5m. 

We have also made one-off returns of 

capital through special dividends. In the 

year, we paid special dividends of 5.5p per 

share or £16.2m. This took total special 

dividend payments over the last three 

years to 37.0 pence or £109m.

In addition to the dividend payments, we 

announced in January 2022 an 18 month 

share buy-back programme which came 

to an end on 30 June 2023. In 2023, we 

purchased 1.9m shares at a cost of £3.1m. 

This took total purchases since the 

programme started to 4.8m shares at cost 

of £7.7m. All of the purchased shares are 

currently held in Treasury. 

Having executed this share buyback

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther informationMarket overview

Overview
Life is never boring within asset finance as the 
industry needs to keep changing to keep pace with 
the needs of its customers.

Changing regulations and rising interest rates, alongside the fear of 

recession and increasing delinquencies, have been push factors for change. 

On the flip side, the need to support new business models, enabling more 

flexible usage of assets over their lifecycle and incorporating additional 

add-on services and fees, plus the need to maintain a stronger relationship 

with the end customer, have been key drivers for innovation.

Alfa continues to listen closely to our clients and engage with the market 

to better understand what we can do to help them achieve their strategic 

goals. We have continued to be headline sponsors of some major industry 

events, where we have spoken as part of expert panel discussions, and we 

have taken an active part in industry association committees in order to 

understand and drive forward the agenda for change.

2023 has been focused on designing and enhancing the product for the 

launch of Alfa Systems 6, which will deliver solutions to meet the learnings 

and requirements gained from these ongoing interactions with the asset 

finance market participants and especially our valued clients. 

12

Europe
Sustainability requirements
European environmental regulations 
and requirements are promoting a faster 
market shift than in other parts of the 
world. Upcoming regulations as part of 
the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD) and the need to increase 
the proportion of electric vehicles (EVs), 
while balancing this with high outright 
cost and high interest rates, have 
necessitated a shift in the business model 
of the original equipment manufacturers 
(OEMs). Finance companies and their 
vendors are being asked to support wider 
use cases to enable affordability of EV 
assets and extend their lifecycle. Alfa has 
been investing in several areas to support 
these sustainability initiatives. This 
includes working with stakeholders 
across our customer base on creating 
a robust Scope 3 emissions reporting 
tool and investing in functionality to 
allow a shift to more active asset lifecycle 
management and usage-based products.

Digital Operational Resilience Act
Another area of focus is the regulation 
coming from the Digital Operational 
Resilience Act (DORA), which financial 
services firms need to be in full compliance 
with by Q4 2024. These requirements 
apply to all critical systems of financial 
services companies and the impacts of 
this on information security are being 
analysed. While the Act could lead to 
enhanced requirements, Alfa already has 
strong information security procedures 
and policies. In fact, DORA could benefit 
Alfa by increasing barriers to market 
entry for smaller technology vendors.

Consumer Duty Regulations
The UK market has been affected by 
the Consumer Duty regulations which 
became active in mid 2023. Whilst Alfa 
has not had to make significant software 
changes to support this, the indirect 
effects are being seen as some players 
move out of the consumer markets 
(benefiting our customers whose market 
share increases). Others need to focus on 
efficiency and cost cutting to adjust to the 
higher levels of risk and associated costs 
which drives them to consider new 
systems. Basel 3.1 (capital requirements 
standards in relation to risks) 
implementation in 2024 could add to the 
regulatory burden and cost of lending to 
consumers and small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs). 

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Australia and New Zealand
Sustainability initiatives
Electric vehicles (EV) incentives passed by 
the Australian Government in November 
2022 made it more beneficial for 
commercial finance companies to offer 
novated leasing for EVs. This led to a triple 
fold increase in EV uptake in the first half 
of 2023, with novated leasing through 
commercial finance companies (fleets) 
accounting for 80% of EVs financed. 

Other initiatives such as AFIA’s Sustainable 
Finance Taxonomy and the National 
Reconstruction Fund (for renewable and 
low emission investments) are driving the 
way forward towards net-zero. 

As mentioned previously, Alfa has been 
investing in several areas to support 
sustainability initiatives and announced 
new functionality in 2023 to help its 
customers track and report their portfolios’ 
Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Economic environment
Australia, alongside the rest of the 
world, is suffering from uncertainty, 
high inflation and interest rates. This 
has led to a challenging environment for 
commercial real estate, leading to banks 
and finance companies diversifying into 
asset finance, increasing competition 
and dampening the effect of the cut in 
government tax incentives for the sector. 

As part of Alfa Systems 6, Alfa further 
improves efficiency of processes, through 
the launch of Compose and enhancements 
to Case Management functionality.

America
Changing US regulations
The US market drivers vary by sector 
and size of organisation. Larger banking 
clients are focused on proposed changes 
to capital requirements, which accentuate 
the need to reduce operating costs, 
increase efficiency and scale operations. 
Equipment finance companies have been 
concerned about regulatory change from 
Dodd-Frank section 1071 mandating 
additional data capture and reporting 
requirements from credit applications. 
A nationwide injunction to this in October 
has allowed the industry to focus on 
other things for the time being, although 
it may emerge again as a risk at the end 
of 2024. 

The launch of Alfa Compose at the end of 
2023, which allows clients to create highly 
personalised screens for specific case 
processes and users, has gained much 
traction as a tool to increase efficiency 
and allow clients to scale.

Economic environment
The global environment of rising interest 
rates and increasing costs has also had 
an impact in the US market, with finance 
providers needing to find additional 
sources of income as well as reduced 
costs through operational efficiency. To 
extract additional revenue, this includes 
incorporating extra fees or add-on 
services and subscriptions to the 
finance contracts.

The need for data to drive customer 
insights, increase revenue opportunities 
including add-on sales, and drive 
performance has led to an increased 
desire for finance providers to have 
more opportunities for direct customer 
interaction. Nevertheless, indirect sales 
through dealerships and dealer portals 
still continue to play an important role 
and, for this channel, speed and price are 
the main drivers of success.

To facilitate this trend, Alfa continues to 
invest in scaling the performance and use 
of Alfa Systems. Priority investments for 
2024 are to complete the enhancement to 
allow full 24/7 operations and to enhance 
performance of key processes including 
the integration into US dealer portals for 
bulk origination processes. 

Technology
AI and machine learning
One of the prominent trends in 2023 has 
been the rapid growth of interest in AI 
and machine learning-based functionality. 

AI and machine learning have been 
around for many years and are used in a 
variety of existing processes within the 
asset finance industry from fraud 
detection and cyber security to credit 
decisioning support. There is a wish to 
further develop the usage of these 
models to improve process efficiency and 
improve the success of delinquency and 
collections processes. Alfa has taken the 
decision to incorporate Alfa iQ into the 
core Alfa Systems product as machine 
learning becomes an expected capability 
for a software platform. The specialist 
team will work alongside those with asset 
finance specific knowledge to integrate 
functionality into Alfa Systems.

Generative AI and the usage of large 
language models (LLMs) is an emerging 
area of interest for the asset finance 
industry. Pilot use cases are emerging 
within automated testing or utilising 
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) 
techniques to improve the user experience 
when accessing knowledge bases. 
However, data governance and uncertain 
regulation mean that there is low uptake 
of this technology for business processes. 
There are paths forward: these use cases 
can be delivered using privately deployed 
foundational LLMs with commercial usage 
rights from cloud providers. Innovation 
at Alfa is driving forward internal pilots 
utilising this approach, building 
functionality which could be extended 
in 2024 to client-facing products. 

Flexible ecosystems
The increasing trend of flexible APIs with 
easy (and no-code) integration allows 
operators to build a flexible ecosystem 
and take advantage of new fintech 
technologies at different stages of their 
processes. This allows Alfa to concentrate 
on its core functionality and create 
partnerships and defined interfaces 
with best-in-breed software providers 
of specialist services. This strategy will 
continue into 2024 with the aim of 
organically growing a network of add-on 
features provided by partner providers.

With the groundwork laid in 2023, we are 

expecting to start to roll out the use of

Evolving Alfa Development Model
In 2023, we set ourselves a challenge: we knew that we had the 

best software in the business but we also knew that the way we 

worked together to enhance that software could be even better. 

We’ve grown significantly and some of our software 

development processes have evolved organically, rather than by 

resulting in a greater level of consistency 

design. We met this challenge by working to improve flow across 

and assurance. 

our development model, ultimately aiming to improve the flow 

of value to our customers. 

Flow is the speed and efficiency with which high-quality work 

moves through an organisation. We have thus made significant 

changes to the structure of our Product Engineering group, 

making it much easier to work with, and have brought more 

clarity to the roles involved in changing our core product. 

When it comes to delivery, we have created 

the ability to migrate back book portfolios 

via a spreadsheet upload, including 

repeatable processes, fully documented 

cutover activity and out-of-the-box 

reconciliation reports. We are also utilising 

innovation and ideas from the experience 

we have within our Delivery workforce 

and will be investing in simplification 

ideas in the areas of testing, 

documentation, processes and Alfa Cloud.

Plans
Migration is one of the most complex 

tasks within a project, and with that in 

mind, in 2024, we plan to continue to 

invest in this area, both from a product 

and tooling perspective. 

Capitalising on the personalised user 

experience, we will be building further 

market and product use-case specific 

components and enable targeted 

editability and actions. Further access to 

runtime customisation options will also 

accelerate the trialling and adoption of 

new features or market functionality as 

part of a streamlined upgrade process.

Definition and KPI 
calculation method
In considering the financial performance of the 
business, the Directors and management use 
key performance indicators (KPIs), some of 
which are defined by IFRS and some of which 
are not specifically defined by IFRS.

We believe that operating free cash 
flow conversion is a key measure required to 
assess our financial performance. It is used 
by management to measure liquidity. This 
measure is not defined by IFRS. 

The most directly comparable IFRS measure for 
operating free cash flow conversion is cash flows 
from operations. The measure is not necessarily 
comparable to similarly referenced measures used 
by other companies. As a result, investors should 
not consider this performance measure in isolation 
from, or as a substitute analysis for, our results of 
operations as determined in accordance with IFRS.

2023 performance
Our employee retention rate has been very 
strong in 2023, reflecting our continued 
investment in learning and development, and 
continued strong employee engagement scores. 
Retention in 2021 dipped in the immediate 
aftermath of the pandemic lockdown easing.

Why do we measure this?
Our deep expertise in the industry and our 
ability to service our customer relationships are 
driven by the quality of our people. A higher 
retention rate demonstrates sustained 
engagement and maintenance of key skills 
and knowledge.

2023 performance
Headcount has increased due to planned 
recruitment and a strong retention rate 
throughout 2023.

Why do we measure this?

and deep expertise of our people and 
therefore growing our team for the future 
is key to this goal.

these services continued as planned (actual 
contract length varies by customer); 

Retention rate: Represents the retention of 
Alfa employees over the previous 12-month 
period, excluding any managed staff attrition.

Employee engagement: The overall employee 
engagement score is derived from quarterly 
employee Pulse survey ratings based on the 
questions “I am happy in my role” and “I would 
recommend Alfa to a friend as an employer”. 
The figures shown are for the last survey of 
the year.

Operating free cash flow conversion: 
Calculated as cash generated from operations, 
less capital expenditures, less the principal 
element of lease payments in respect of IFRS16. 
Operating free cash flow conversion represents 
operating free cash flow generated as a 
proportion of operating profit.

Total contract value (“TCV”): TCV is calculated 
by analysing future contract revenue based on 
the following components:

(i)  an assumption of three years of Subscription 
payments (including maintenance, Cloud 

(ii)  the estimated remaining time to complete 
Services and Software deliverables within 
contracted software implementations, and 
recognise deferred licence amounts (which 
may not all be under a signed statement 
of work); and

(iii)  Pre-implementation and ongoing Services 
and Software work which is contracted 
under a statement of work. 

As TCV is a reflection of future revenues, 
forward looking exchange rates are used for 
the conversion into GBP. 

Constant currency: When the Company 
believes it would be helpful for understanding 
trends in its business, the Company provides 
percentage increases or decreases in its 
revenues or operating profit to eliminate the 
effect of changes in currency values. When trend 
information is expressed herein “in constant 
currencies”, the comparative results are derived 
by re-calculating comparative non-GBP 
denominated revenues using the average 
exchange rates of the comparable months in the 
current reporting period.

in our subscription stream driven by growth 
in subscription-based customers as well as a 
number of perpetual customers moving into

by 10% reflecting growth in our delivery 
capabilities, while Software is slightly down as a 
result of our transition to a subscription model.

2023 performance
Operating profit increased from last year as a 
result of growth in revenues, partially offset by 
increased salary, hosting and internal computer 
costs. The margin was lower this year due to 
favourable items in the prior year.

2023 performance
Cash generated from operations remained 
strong in 2023 with over 100% cash conversion, 
allowing for the payment of further special 
dividends totalling £16.6m.

Why do we measure this?
Cash is critical to allow the Group to cover 
its expenses, provide funds for investment, 
growth and to meet its long-term needs. 
Cash generation is a good indicator of the 
underlying health of the business.

2023 performance
Operating free cash flow conversion for 2023 
was very strong, due to favourable billings and 
early collections in the final months of the year.

Why do we measure this?
A strong unencumbered balance sheet position 
is key to growing the business in the future. Our 
business has always been cash-generative and 
this KPI allows us to monitor cash flows before 
investment in capital projects. The calculation of 
the KPI is included on page 30.

2023 performance
Total TCV has seen strong growth since 
31 December 2022, driven by our subscription 
stream, with two new customers being fully 
contracted in Q4. This is offset by a drop in 
software TCV as a result of our transition 
from perpetual to subscription licences, 
and services is slightly down due to some 
new Alfa implementations, including one of 
the customers contracted in Q4, completing 
during 2023. See page 29 for further detail.

Why do we measure this?
Helps to predict revenue and the value of a

extend beyond the current financial year.

(2022: £59.9m) slightly behind the increase 

in revenue mainly due to increased 

headcount and salary inflation, with 

operating profit increasing by 2% or £0.5m 

to £30.1m (2022: £29.6m) with profit before 

tax of £29.6m (2022: £28.9m). 

The Effective Tax Rate (ETR) for 2023 is 

20.6% (2022: 15.2%) which increased over 

2022 largely due to the increase in the UK 

Corporation Tax rate. The resulting profit 

for the period was £23.5m (2022: £24.5m).

We have continued to invest in our

transaction costs have been removed from SG&A to

better show underlying costs, and have been shown 
together with other income in the table above. 

Cost of sales increased by £4.9m to 

£38.3m (2022: £33.4m) to support 

the growth in the business. This was 

due to higher headcount, in both our 

implementation and engineering teams 

along with pay increases. Hosting costs 

increased from the strong growth in 

Alfa Cloud.

Sales, general and administrative (SG&A) 

costs increased to £34.0m in the year 

(2022: £32.1m). Salary costs were up 12% 

in the period to £46.8m (2022: £41.8m) 

due to higher headcount and pay 

increases. Profit Share Pay, including 

employer’s costs, in the period was £3.8m 

(2022: £3.5m). Share-based payment 

charges have decreased over last year at 

£1.6m (2022: £1.8m), principally due to 

lower provision for NI costs from a lower 

share price at year end. Other costs 

increased 11% to £15.6m (2022: £14.0m) 

with cost patterns returning to normal 

along with the impact of inflation.

Other income, FX and one-off costs 

decreased by 78% since 2022. Included 

within this is £0.5m (2022: nil) of income 

related to the Research & Development 

expenditure credit (“RDEC”) scheme which 

we qualified for in 2023 for the first time, 

with reduction in sub-letting income in FY

full overhead allocation, and includes 

amounts shown as R&D expense and 

costs that have been capitalised.

Profit before tax
Net finance costs reduced to £0.2m 

(2022: £0.6m) benefiting from a full year 

of reduced lease costs and interest 

income of £0.3m (2022: £nil). Overall 

Profit before Tax of £29.6m was up 2% 

on last year (2022: £28.9m).

Profit for the period
Profit after taxation decreased by £1.0m, 

or 4%, to £23.5m (2022: £24.5m). The 

Effective Tax Rate (ETR) for the year 

increased to 20.6% (2022: 15.2%) as 

a result of the increase in the UK 

corporation tax rate, net of the benefit 

from prior year credits of £1.2m 

principally due to the last year of 

operating under the R&D tax credit 

scheme. For the full year 2024, we expect 

the ETR to be around 26% due to the full 

year effect of the increase in the UK 

Corporation Tax rate to 25% along with 

the loss of the R&D tax credit which has 

been replaced by RDEC scheme, which is

increased tax charge. Diluted earnings 

per share decreased by 2% to 7.90 pence 

(2022: 8.09 pence).

Cash flow
Cash generated from operations was 

very strong at £39.2m in the period 

(2022: £34.0m) up £5.2m on last year. 

Net cash generated from operating 

activities was also very strong at £32.2m 

(2022: £27.2m) with tax payments of 

£6.5m up on the £6.2m for 2022.

Net cash (including the effect of exchange 

rate changes) increased by £3.1m to 

£21.8m at 31 December 2023. In the year 

the 2022 final dividend and two special 

dividends were paid, totalling £19.7m 

(2022: £22.5m). In addition, the purchase 

of own shares was £4.8m (2022: £5.6m) 

for both the share buy-back, which 

ended in June 2023, and to fund the 

Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). Net 

capital expenditure of £3.4m was up 

on last year (2022: £2.3m) with increased 

capitalisation of software, as expected, 

up to £2.8m (2022: £1.5m) and with other 

capex of £0.6m (2022: £0.8m) principally 

due to investment in IT equipment.

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther informationRisk management

Alfa’s effective risk management provides a foundation 
for the safe pursuit of our strategic goals, innovation 
and opportunities.

Our Risk Management 
Framework – how we identify 
and manage risks
Our risk management framework is 

designed to be flexible and proactive, and 

links tightly into our operations, strategy 

and decision-making. This allows us to 

react with speed and agility to new and 

evolving risks as they arise, across all of 

our business areas. This has helped us in 

2023 to continue to progress our strategic 

objectives, and to identify and pursue 

opportunities as they arose.

We recognise that managing risk 

effectively is integral to executing our 

strategy. We have therefore implemented 

a five-step process for monitoring and 

managing risk throughout our business, 

allowing the Directors to conduct a robust 

assessment of the principal risks facing 

the Group. Risk is not something that 

should be eliminated but, instead, 

identified, assessed and managed 

in a timely manner.

Introduction
2023 has seen our risk environment 

evolve, and our monitoring and mitigation 

has kept in step with this evolution, 

guided by our well-established risk 

management framework. Careful 

management of risks has helped to 

ensure that our operations and strategy 

have continued to prove their resilience 

towards external themes, such as the 

continuing global economic uncertainty, 

high interest rates and cost of living, and 

their potential impacts on the asset 

finance industry which we serve. Our 

principal risks, each categorised as 

external or internal, are explained on 

pages 36 to 44.

We have an established governance 

regime in place for risk management 

(see page 33), which puts assessment, 

monitoring and controlling of risks at 

the heart of our strategy. On behalf of 

the Board, and with oversight by the 

Audit and Risk Committee, the Risk 

Management function has focused in 

2023 on identifying, understanding, 

monitoring and controlling risks, as well 

as providing direction on the level of risk 

that Alfa is willing to take to achieve our 

strategic goals.

Alfa puts considerable focus on our 

responsibility towards society and the 

environment, and we seek to make a 

positive impact across a broad range of 

ESG topics. As such it is vital that ESG-

related risks are included in our risk 

management activities. We consider how 

topics such as climate change will impact 

our industry, but also consider our 

responsibilities and the sustainability 

of our activities. Whilst we do not have 

any ESG-related principal risks, there is 

discussion of our ESG risk assessment

Deﬁne risk
appetite

Whilst overall responsibility for risk lies at the Board level, the Directors have 

delegated authority for risk identification to the Company Leadership Team 

(CLT). A bottom-up approach has primarily been undertaken to provide a 

detailed review of risks by relevant business owners and this is led by the 

Risk Officer, twice a year. Each identified risk is categorised into one or more 

business areas, and is assigned to the most appropriate business owner.

Risks are assessed to understand the likelihood and the impact of the risk 

crystallising. We assess risk across all of our business areas, and we consider 

their level of impact to our organisation across these categories:

•  Financial
•  Operational

•  Reputational
•  Legal and regulatory

•  ESG

The assessed risks are then reviewed by the CLT and the Audit and Risk Committee, 

to provide assurance over completeness and quality of the risk register.

Our systems and processes are designed to manage our exposure to risk rather 

than eliminate the risk completely. Therefore the Audit and Risk Committee, 

with the CLT, will reassess the Group’s risk appetite each year with this in mind. 

The Audit and Risk Committee will consider the risks associated with the 

conduct of our business and the delivery of our strategy, assessing the risks we 

are exposed to and evaluating whether this exposure is acceptable given the 

likelihood and severity of the risk.

4

Respond, manage
and mitigate

Each risk is reviewed at least annually, bi-annually for the higher priority risks. 

At each review date, the existing controls are reviewed for adequacy and 

effectiveness. Due to the ever-changing business landscape and the industry 

we work in, it is quite possible for the control requirements to change and for 

processes and policies to require updating. If this is the case, then the business 

owner is responsible for implementing changes.

5

Monitor 
and review

Management monitors progress against the principal risks. This is shared with 

our internal auditor, BDO, to assist with forming the internal audit plan. The 

Board reviews the summary risk register and assesses the adequacy of the 

principal risks identified, as well as the mitigating controls and procedures 

which are in place.

Governance (ESG) risk 
assessment
We put a particular focus on ESG-related 

risks, and in 2023, as part of our bi-annual 

risk reviews, we re-assessed these risks, 

which are tracked within our Corporate 

Risk Register. We do not currently have 

any ESG related risks that are sufficiently 

high to be considered principal risks 

or uncertainties.

Refer to pages 70 to 72 (Task Force on 

Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) 

which discusses specific risks related to 

our climate change responsibilities. We 

will continue to risk assess this area as 

we progress our ESG objectives in 2024.

Focus for 2024
•  Continuous improvement of 

risk management procedures, 

including raising awareness 

within the Company of our risk 

management best practices.

•  Risk identification and 

assessment – bi-annual risk 

reviews including assessing 

actions and effectiveness 

of controls.

•  Information security, cyber 

security and data protection 

– maintain SOC1 Type 2, SOC2 

Type 2 and ISO programme 

compliance, and continue to 

assess and strengthen our 

cyber security defences.

•  Business continuity and 

disaster recovery scenario 

testing exercises, covering 

our operational systems, 

and Alfa Cloud.

•  Internal audit – provides 

assurance on the adequacy 

of our risk management, 

governance and internal 

control arrangements. 

Our risk appetite
Our risk appetite provides us with 

guidance on the levels of risk we are 

prepared to take in pursuit of our 

objectives, and is considered a 

fundamental part of the planning and 

execution of our strategy. Our risk 

appetite is assessed across the following 

categories: strategic, financial, legal, 

operational and ESG. Each of these areas 

has different considerations, and it is 

important that we are setting the correct 

tone for decision making in each area. 

This is then consolidated up to determine 

our overall risk appetite.

In December 2023, the Board, assisted by 

the Risk and Audit Committee and the CLT, 

assessed and updated our risk appetite 

in light of the developing in-year and 

emerging risks.

Overall, we take a cautious approach 

to risk, aiming to operate in a manner 

that would not be expected to put the 

business at risk of significant financial, 

operational or reputational damage. 

It is recognised that an element of risk 

taking is necessary in order to seek out 

and pursue opportunities, including 

progressing our strategic objectives. 

Nevertheless, the risks associated with 

the pursuit of such opportunities should 

be commensurate with the level of reward 

expected from the opportunities.

At the current time of heightened 

geo-political risk, we recognise that the 

principal risk A–socio-economic and 

geo-political risk, is currently showing 

outside of our acceptable risk appetite 

range, as it was in FY22. This risk is due 

to external factors, and we consider its 

heightened level to be somewhat outside 

of our control, and that this will be 

temporary. Our strategy for growth and 

diversification is a key mitigation, helping 

us to remain resilient, and adapt as this

Principal risks and uncertainties in more detail
The Group faces a number of risks that may adversely affect our strategic and business objectives, operations, liquidity, financial 

position, reputation or future performance, not all of which are wholly within our control or known to us. Some such risks may 

currently be regarded as immaterial and could turn out to be material. We accept that risk is an inherent part of doing business.

The Board consider the following matters to be the principal risks and uncertainties (in no specific order) affecting our business at 

this time.

2023 has seen a continuation of the uncertainty 
in the global economic outlook. This may impact 
demand for our services, or impact our margin, 
in one or more of our regions. This uncertainty 
is due to a variety of external factors, such as the 
geo-political tensions caused by the war in Ukraine, 
the war in the Levant, and the economic recovery 
following the COVID-19 pandemic.

The potential impacts of this risk are:

Strategy for diversification: Our strategy aims to 
diversify our customer base, both geographically 
and by asset type (i.e. automotive, equipment) 
but also by type of customer (i.e. banking, OEM or 
independent) which therefore have different and 
often contrasting risk characteristics. This mitigates 
some of this risk as there is often a degree of cyclical 
trend affecting the auto and equipment finance 
industry.

•  Potential impacts of economic uncertainty on our 
customers and their markets may reduce their 
spend on our services. Noting that we have no 
customers nor operations in Ukraine nor in the 
Levant or elsewhere in the Middle East, so do not 
have direct exposure to those regions.

•  Inflation remains at abnormally high levels in 

many of our regions (although this has cooled), 
due to the above factors, and is leading to 
increased costs to our business. These increases 
may outpace our revenue increases, if we are 
unable to increase our fees in line with costs.

•  Reduced consumer confidence in a period of 
uncertainty, higher inflation and high interest 
rates may lead to reduced demand for consumer 
asset finance, and therefore a knock-on reduced 
demand for our services.

•  High interest rates result in a high cost of 

borrowing for our asset finance customers, which 
may put pressure on their margins if they cannot 
pass those on to customers. This may reduce their 
ability to spend on technology change projects.

The above external factors have led to us assessing 
this risk as remaining at its previous level.

Additionally, our strategy aims to diversify our 
revenue streams to build further resilience, with 
our subscription Alfa Cloud offering now well 
established alongside our implementation 
professional services and ongoing development 
services.

Financial robustness: We ensure that the Group 
is financially robust and resilient to economic 
downturns, or project pauses, by retaining cash 
reserves and invoicing and collecting promptly 
for services.

Fees for our services are generally increased 
annually, taking consideration of the increases 
experienced in our cost base.

Customer alignment: We take proactive steps to 
maintain strong relationships with our customers in 
each market, with close collaboration on strategic 
aims and growth opportunities. This helps us to be 
resilient and adapt to changing market conditions.

Our strategic priorities

1

Strengthen – Grow our differentiation of 
market-leading People, Product and Delivery.
2 Sell – Focus on cloud-hosted, subscription sales 

to our target markets.

3 Scale – Increase our capacity for developing and 

delivering Alfa Systems.

4 Simplify – Simplifying our product, implementations 
and processes to enable more concurrent Alfa 
Systems implementations.

This risk goes hand-in-hand with opportunity, 
as our customers may seek to adapt to the 
changing economic environment, seeking 
operational efficiency, introducing new products 
or reacting to regulatory changes. Alfa is well 
placed to help with the system and process 
changes needed for such adaptation, either 
where Alfa Systems is the incumbent system 
or where a new system is needed.

Progress highlights in FY23

Decreasing customer concentration: The number 
of customers contributing more than £2m to annual 
revenue has grown from 17 in FY22 to 19 in FY23. 
This demonstrates the effect of our growing 
customer base on diversifying our exposure to our 
largest customers. 

Strategy for diversification:

We have achieved substantial growth in our 
subscription revenue, largely through the success 
of our Alfa Cloud offering. Subscription now 
contributes 31% of our revenue (FY22: 29%). 

We have reinforced our geographical diversification, 
with successful go-lives across all of our operating 
regions in 2023 (US, Asia Pacific and EMEA), and an 
implementation in a new country (Mexico). 

Total Contractual Value (TCV):
Our TCV has grown from £143m in FY22 to £165m, 
giving some indication of the forward demand for 
our services. 

Customer alignment:
Our markets and products team have worked 
closely with our client-facing teams and customers, 
hosting regular user group sessions, and a multitude 
of liaison and product strategy alignment sessions 
with our customers.

We are a people-centric organisation, with our 
success heavily dependent on keeping the right 
culture, skills and teams in place to execute 
our strategy.

A failure to attract, train and retain high quality 
individuals in our key operating regions may limit 
our ability to deliver implementations, maintain 
product quality and leading-edge functionality, and 
to manage customer relations. This would impact 
our ability to deliver on our strategic plan.

We continue to see high competition in recruitment 
markets, although this has reduced somewhat from 
peak levels.

As such, this risk remains at the same level 
as previously.

Recruitment of graduates and experienced hires is 
continuing across all of our regions, with dedicated 
HR staff using a diverse number of sources, searching 
for candidates from varied backgrounds and ethnicity 
and with varied core skills.

Partnering provides a strong and growing network 
of professional services partner organisations, with 
extensive and established geographical presence. 
This provides us with resourcing flexibility, and 
wider geographical coverage.

Learning and development: Our diligent 
onboarding process, with role-specific training, 
gives our new joiners the knowledge to help them 
to succeed. This important training regime is a 
significant time commitment, and does increase 
onboarding time for our employees, but the benefits 
justify this. We endeavour to maintain a culture 
centred around our principles and values, and 
we have a strong focus on employee satisfaction, 
wellbeing and engagement.

Employee engagement: Surveys are carried out 
every quarter, and allow areas for improvement to 
be identified and acted upon.

Remuneration: We benchmark our remuneration 
levels against relevant roles in the industry and aim 
to be competitive.

Progress highlights in FY23

Retention & employee engagement: Retention has 
remained high, at 97% (higher than the FY22: 90%). 
Employee engagement has remained at similar high 
levels to 2022 (2023: 82%, 2022: 84%).

Recruitment: We have continued to strengthen 
and grow our team, with active recruitment of top 
quality talent across many areas of the business, 
in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific. This includes 
both experienced hires, and intakes into our 
graduate scheme.

Learning and development: We have further 
strengthened our culture of curiosity, with notable 
successes such as a new advanced leadership 
programme, and a series of important 
improvements to our graduate programme training 
curriculum. We have also introduced an extensive 
catalogue of training materials covering a very 
broad range of relevant skills.

Our systems, networks and products may be subject 
to cyber attacks, specifically designed to disrupt 
our business, obtain our intellectual property or 
data, or harm our reputation. A successful cyber 
attack could impinge upon our ability to operate 
our business, including our ability to continue 
providing support to our customers.

Monitoring and control: Our internal Information 
Security team monitors key security and cyber risks, 
assesses and monitors the control framework of our 
key technology suppliers and undertakes day-to-day 
monitoring of IT security incidents. 

Continuous improvement: We implement continual 
improvements in our IT control environment.

Our Alfa Cloud offering stores our customers’ 
data on third party cloud hosting platforms. 
A security breach in our Alfa Cloud offering 
could result in compliance violations, identify 
theft, malware infections, diminished customer 
trust and loss of revenue.

There is a continuing global trend of cyber attacks 
against organisations, including large-scale, 
sophisticated and coordinated attacks.

Employee education: We maintain an annual 
education and training programme for all staff, 
covering Information Security, Data Privacy and 
Business Continuity.

Customer assurance: Our customers perform 
thorough assessments of the security of the Alfa 
Cloud platform during their system selection and 
implementation process, measuring our processes 
and controls against their own, typically stringent, 
internal policies. These compliance checks sit 
alongside our own policies and procedures, and 
provide independent assurance for our customers 
that appropriate security controls are in place.

Progress highlights in FY23

Assurance around controls: We have maintained 
our SOC2 Type 2, ISO27001 and ISO27018 compliance 
in 2023. We have also achieved SOC1 Type 2 
accreditation, providing additional assurance 
around our controls.

Monitoring and control: We have implemented a 
range of continuous improvements to our cyber 
security processes and controls. We have further 
strengthened our security team in 2023 with 
recruitment of additional specialists.

We are at risk of disruption to our day-to-day 
operations if there is a disaster incident which 
causes our internal IT systems to fail, we do not 
have access to our office space, or if significant 
numbers of our personnel are unavailable.

A failure to be able to use key IT systems or access 
our infrastructure could lead to a failure to deliver 
our services (particularly urgent maintenance 
services in the event of a disaster) to our customers 
and therefore have a negative reputational impact.

This risk includes consideration of future pandemics. 

Established procedures: We have an established, 
detailed and tested incident management procedure 
and escalation process.

Assurance around procedures: We have a disaster 
recovery and business continuity plan which is 
reviewed and tested annually, and is included in the 
SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 audits. This includes 
an impact analysis exercise, which identifies key 
systems, and assigns clear ownership of each of 
those systems and their business continuity plans.

Alfa Cloud procedures: Where we provide Alfa 
Cloud hosting services, using third party cloud 
hosting suppliers, we have annually-tested disaster 
recovery plans which initiate automatically if a 
server or a region becomes unavailable. In addition, 
if a cloud provider ceases to operate, we have a 
continuity plan in place to transfer our customers’ 
data to a similar supported environment.

Global distribution: We have a geographically 
distributed workforce, and the majority of our key 
systems are cloud hosted, providing resilience 
against an event impacting one particular location.

Progress highlights in FY23

Testing: We have successfully tested key business 
continuity processes, including system failover and 
disaster recovery, across both our corporate 
network and systems, and Alfa Cloud.

Streamlining: Business continuity and disaster 
recovery processes have been aligned between our 
internal teams and our Alfa Cloud offering, enabling 
streamlining and sharing of best practice.

Assurance: Our SOC1 Type 2 and SOC2 Type 2 
reporting and complete failover testing has identified 
no significant required remedial actions.

There has been considerable fluctuation and 
volatility in currency exchange rates throughout 
2023, as a result of factors such as those listed in 
Risk A – Socio-economic and geo-political risk. 
There is a risk of continued volatility in 2024.

As we expand our operations, for example in the 
EU, our exposure to currency volatility increases.

Currency diversification: Our spread of revenue 
and costs across different regions, and currencies, 
provides a degree of natural hedging against volatility.

Hedging: We closely monitor exchange rates, 
and take appropriate action, such as converting 
excess funds to Sterling, and entering into forward 
contracts to hedge against short-term risk. Such 
monitoring is also incorporated into our budget 
forecasting process.

Progress highlights in FY23

Hedging: As part of our foreign exchange risk 
management, in 2023 we entered into forward 
foreign exchange contracts to limit our exposure 
to exchange rate volatility.

The current high inflation environment, coupled 
high salaries in the technology industry, may lead 
to an increased cost base across all of our regions. 
We may also see competitors offer similar services 
at lower rates, forcing us to reduce revenue in order 
to remain competitive. Without appropriate 
mitigation these would reduce our margins.

Annual fee increases: Our fees for services are 
generally increased annually, taking consideration 
of the increases experienced in our cost base.

Pricing governance: Our Deal Committee has 
oversight of our pricing policy, making sure that 
our pricing is correctly targeted.

Differentiators: Our strategy is to maintain and 
grow our differentiation of market-leading people, 
product and delivery, and these set us aside from 
our competitors, making us a compelling choice to 
ensure success in the kind of complex technology 
transformation projects where we operate.

Simplification, Start: Our Start and Simplification 
objectives are targeting more efficient implementations, 
further strengthening our competitiveness.

Progress highlights in FY23

Sales conversions and delivery successes: We 
have converted three prospects into customers, and 
have had a record year for implementations, with 35 
go-lives and upgrades (FY22: 28). This demonstrates 
the strength of our differentiators – our market-
leading people, product and delivery.

Our competitor landscape is evolving, with some

regions, and developing their product offerings.

There’s also the possibility of disruptive competition, 
for example from big tech companies moving into 
auto sales (this is discussed as an emerging risk, 
see page 44).

This is a pre-existing risk which has been newly-
escalated into the principal risks in 2023, as a result 
of a reassessment of the competition we are seeing 
at sales stage, for example aggressive sales tactics 
from competitors. 

Differentiators: Our strongest mitigations 
are differentiating features–the quality of our 
product, delivery record, and people. Our strategy 
aims to retain and develop these, enabling us to 
be the global platform of choice across the asset 
finance industry.

Customer alignment: We ensure that we 
are closely-aligned with customer needs, and 
hence with the market needs, through the active 
engagement with our customers, via our client-
facing teams, and the Markets and Products team. 
This also guides our investment programme, 
allowing us to target our product investment

Legacy versions of Alfa Systems (pre-version 5) 
remain in operation for a small subset of our 
customers, who are not yet ready to upgrade.

Retaining the hardware and software needed 
to support and maintain these older version of 
Alfa Systems, may become expensive and 
time-consuming.

There is also a risk due to skillsets for supporting 
and maintaining these older versions being 
concentrated in a small team, leading to key 
person dependencies.

Decommissioning: Ultimately we will seek to 
decommission the hardware and software 
specific to these older versions of Alfa, once all 
customers have moved off these older versions. 
We discuss decommissioning dates with our 
customers, and options for moving to the newest 
version of Alfa Systems. 

Cost recovery: Provision is included in customer 
contracts for recovering increasing costs of 
maintaining older versions of Alfa Systems. 

Progress highlights in FY23

Decommissioning: We have upgrade projects in 
progress, moving customers onto Alfa Systems v5, for 
the majority of impacted customers. This includes the 
last customers on our managed service infrastructure 
for Alfa Systems v3 and v4, which will allow some 
important infrastructure decommissioning. 

Cloud infrastructure: Options are being 
investigated for moving the remaining required 
hardware and software to cloud infrastructure, 
to enable easier maintenance and supportability.

•  Increase our capacity for developing and delivering 

Alfa Systems;

•  Enable more concurrent Alfa Systems implementations, 

more efficiently.

The Group’s prospects are assessed primarily through its annual 

planning process, led by the CEO with the CLT. All relevant 

functions are involved, including finance, sales, recruitment 

and resourcing, and commercial.

During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group generated 

profit before tax of £29.6m and was cash-generative with net 

cash generated from operating activities amounting to £32.2m. 

The Group was also able to pay special dividends in the year of 

£16.2m in addition to the ordinary dividend for 2022 of £3.5m. 

The Board participates fully in the annual process and has the 

task of considering whether the plan appropriately takes 

into account the external environment, including technological, 

social and macroeconomic changes, as well as the risks and 

uncertainties of the business.

Taking into account the Group’s current position and its principal 

risks and uncertainties as described on pages 36 to 44 of this 

Annual Report, the Directors have assessed the Group’s 

prospects and viability.

The output of the annual review process includes the annual 

financial budget and an analysis of the risks which could prevent 

the plan being delivered.

Assessment period and process
The strategy and business model as set out on pages 16 to 25 

and 14 to 15 are central to an understanding of its prospects. 

These inputs provide a framework for assessing the Group’s 

prospects and viability.

Detailed financial forecasts which include profit, cash flow and 

key financial ratios have been prepared for the three-year period 

to December 2026.

The first year of the financial forecasts forms the Group’s 2024 

budget and is subject to a reforecast process each quarter. The 

second and third years are prepared in detail based on the 

Group’s three year strategic planning process and are flexed 

based on the actual results in the first year.

and uncertainties on pages 36 to 44.

The Board has considered the Group’s financial performance in 

2023, and the risk factors noted above and consider that the key 

risks which could have a major impact on the delivery of the 

Group’s financial objectives are as follows:

•  Socio-economic or geopolitical risks impacting conversion of 

the sales pipeline and/or spending by existing customers;

•  Risks to people, teams and skills impacting our capacity to 

deliver services to customers;

•  Pressure on margins due to increased cost base, or through 

increased competition;

•  Competitive pressure leading to a loss of market share in our 

target markets.

Conclusion
It was determined that none of the individual risks would, in 

In the case of such a scenario crystallising the Group would be 

required to take some mitigating actions largely related to the 

level of headcount in the business, the level of partner usage and 

discretionary spending. In addition there are many other different 

levers that could be pulled to further minimise the financial 

impact and maintain liquidity to continue in operation.

Revenue and profitability are clearly affected in this alternative 

scenario, however based on the Group’s existing cash reserves, 

combined with incremental cost reduction measures, the 

business would retain sufficient cash reserves to continue in 

operation throughout the three-year forecast period, with the 

lowest cash balance modelled in this period of £9.4m.

Whilst it is acknowledged that there is continued uncertainty 

over future economic conditions, based on the assessment of 

prospects and viability, the Directors confirm that they have a 

reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 

isolation, compromise the Group’s viability. The Directors

Our employees are central to everything 

we do. Listening to our employees, being 

flexible, supportive and inclusive, are our 

routes to growing and retaining Alfa’s talent 

pool, enabling us to deliver against our 

strategic priorities and develop our people.

The Board places great importance on 

having positive relationships with all our 

investors and seeks to ensure there is 

an appropriate and constructive dialogue 

with all our investors.

Our customers are central to our business 

and we aim to deliver our leading-edge 

technology to them making our customers 

future-ready. 

We have a responsibility to add value to the 

communities in which we operate. We have 

employee-led community groups that 

are safe spaces for colleagues to promote 

issues, support each other and contribute 

to organisational change.

Building trusted partnerships and 

developing relationships with suppliers 

through ongoing dialogue helps us to 

better understand the needs of our 

partners and to develop and improve 

our offering.

Engaging with our stakeholders

Section 172 statement
This section of the Strategic report and 

the pages to which it refers, comprise 

the Company’s section 172(1) statement 

together with the statements set out 

earlier in this report as to how the 

Directors have engaged with employees 

and have regards to their interests, and 

how the Directors have had regard to 

the Company’s business relationships 

with its customers, suppliers and 

external stakeholders.

The Board is responsible for leading 

stakeholder engagement and ensuring 

that we fulfil our obligations. Our key 

stakeholders are those who influence or 

are affected by our day-to-day activities. 

These stakeholders groups have varying 

needs and expectations; our aim at 

Alfa is to engage effectively with all 

stakeholders, to develop and maintain 

positive and productive relations. 

The Board, together with the Directors, 

considers any current risks or emerging 

risks with regard to each stakeholder 

group as part of the overall principal risk 

assessment, which is contained on pages 

36 to 45. 

For each matter that comes before the 

Board, the Board considers the likely 

consequences of any decision in the long 

term, identifies stakeholders that may 

be affected and carefully considers 

their interests and the potential impact 

of the decision-making process.

Engagement with our shareholders and 

wider stakeholder groups plays a vital role 

in Alfa’s business. Alfa’s key stakeholders 

and why they are important to us are set

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023How the Board fulfils 
its section 172 duties
Our Directors

The Board of Directors of Alfa has always 

taken decisions for the long term, and 

collectively and individually our aim is to 

uphold the highest standards of conduct.

The needs of our stakeholders and the 

consequences of any decision in the 

long term are taken into consideration 

by the Board when making decisions. 

The differing interests of stakeholders 

are considered in the business decisions 

we make across Alfa, at all levels, and are 

reinforced by the Board setting the right 

tone from the top. 

Considerations in Board decisions

In performing their duties during the year, 

the Directors have had regard for the 

matters set out in Section 172(1) of the 

Companies Act 2006. Examples of how 

the Directors have oversight of 

stakeholder matters and had regard for 

these matters when making decisions is 

included throughout the Strategic report 

and Corporate Governance sections of 

this Report.

Establishing our culture, values 

and strategy

The Board is responsible for the long-term 

success of the Company, through setting, 

overseeing and driving the Company’s 

culture, values and strategy. By discharging 

the above responsibilities effectively, all 

our stakeholder groups are impacted 

positively, whether it be by providing an 

environment where our employees thrive, 

or by requiring the highest standards of 

services and partnership to our customers 

and suppliers, or by managing the business 

effectively to generate returns to investors, 

and the communities we are part of. 

Information to the Board

The Board receives information on how 

we engage with our stakeholders, which 

they review regularly throughout the year, 

to ensure that the long-term impact on 

any of these groups is considered.

Monitoring

Where the Board does not engage directly 

with our stakeholders, it is kept updated 

so that Directors maintain an effective 

understanding of what matters to our 

stakeholders and can draw on these 

perspectives in Board decision making 

and strategy development.

The following pages set out key stakeholder

with those stakeholders, and the wider 
business engagement and the impact of 
such activities conducted during the year.

Gender pay gap and the 
Women’s Community
During 2023, the People team 

collaborated with Alfa’s Women’s 

Community to gather feedback 

through focus groups, with input 

from female colleagues and allies 

that make up the Community’s 

membership. Potential actions for 

reducing our gender pay gap were 

identified and explored, with open 

discussion and great ideas were 

tabled. The key relevant themes 

and action areas (such as career 

development and recruitment), 

have been built into a Gender 

Pay Gap Action Plan, which was 

presented to the Board by our 

Chief People Officer in December 

2023. The Women’s Community 

is continuing work alongside 

central teams to take the agreed 

actions forward in 2024 and we 
look forward to seeing the positive 

impact these initiatives will have.

Employees
Why we engage

Engagement with employees is paramount to maintaining the 

strong culture at Alfa. Employee engagement is fundamental to 

our success, employees who feel valued are more likely to 

contribute innovative ideas and solutions. We continue to 

cultivate a culture of innovation and empowerment and, we are 

proud that our people are highly engaged and supportive of 

each other and of the organisation’s aims. 

How the Company engages
•  We maintain our commitment to diversity, equity and 

inclusion, keeping this front of mind when making decisions. 
We launched our diversity, equity and inclusion employee 
survey, which sought feedback from colleagues on how we’re 
doing and suggestions for areas to work on.

•  Internal communications are enhanced to consistently 
align with Alfa’s strategy and core themes, providing 
clarity and focus. 

•  Regular global and regional Company meetings, conferences 
and Town Hall meetings are held to bring employees up to 
speed with the latest projects, strategy and performance. 
The objectives and progress of our corporate objectives 
were also cascaded to the wider management team for 
onward communication.

•  We conduct a quarterly employee engagement Pulse survey. 
The survey is anonymous to encourage employees to be 
candid in their responses. Focus groups were established to 
look at particular topics arising from the survey. Output from 
the survey and focus groups is regularly provided to the Board 
by the CEO and CPO. 

•  We have a flexible inclusive working structure that creates 
opportunities for teams to come together to connect, 
collaborate, and innovate. Striking the right balance makes 
it possible for the Group to achieve great outcomes for 
colleagues, customers, and the community.

How the Board engages
•  The Board reviewed the Gender pay gap report and initiatives 

identified by the action plan. 

•  Members of the Board attended the EMEA Company 

meeting, which provided interaction between the Board 
with a wide range of employees across functions, leading 
to a deeper understanding of the daily objectives, challenges 
and opportunities. 

•  The Board reviewed the results of the Pulse surveys during the 
year, which allows for greater insight into colleague sentiment 
across the Group and provides direct feedback on areas that 
can be improved. 

•  The Board attended an event which hosted a number of new 

hires and graduates.

development of our business relationships. Increasing our use 

of partners is a key element of our longer-term strategy for

are working with partners to help cultivate operational agility 

and engaging with suppliers to ensure that ethical and 

environmental standards are upheld. 

How the Company engages

Procurement Policy and Procedures. This ensures that the 

suppliers we choose to work with share our values, in particular 

those in relation to ESG, as well as meeting our compliance and 

due diligence requirements.

carbon reduction projects across the world, with a level of 

transparency on what the project is doing.

initiating changes to reporting, financial products and compliance. 

Unsolicited offers for the Company

Board discussion
Following the unsolicited approaches from EQT Fund Management 
S.à r.l (EQT) and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (THL) regarding a 
possible offer for the Company, the Board was required to 
consider the impact on all stakeholders of its decision to 
recommend, or not recommend, the transactions to shareholders.

The Board was mindful of its duty under Section 172 of the 
Companies Act 2006 to promote the success of the Company for 
the benefit of its members as a whole and had regard to all the 
factors under Section 172 when reaching its decision, in particular 
the likely consequences of any decision in the long term. See below 
for further information on the specific factors considered.

Following the initial proposal from EQT, and the potential conflict of 
interest of the Company’s controlling shareholder (whose directors 
are Andrew Page, Executive Chairman, and Andrew Denton, CEO), the 
Board approved the establishment of an Independent Bid Committee 
(IBC), and its members would comprise exclusively the Company’s 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The role of the IBC was to 
principally decide whether or not to recommend the final terms of 
any offer to the Company’s shareholders in accordance with the 
requirements of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 

Stakeholder considerations and impacts
Stakeholder impacts were considered throughout the offer periods. 
The interests of the Company’s employees were considered at 
length, both in terms of the impact of negotiations with potential 
bidders as well as the impact of any potential transaction once 
completed. Updates were provided to employees on the situation 
as and when permitted under the City Code on Takeovers and 
Mergers. The proposals were considered in relation to the potential 
effects of the employees, including stability and long-term cultural 
fit of the Company. The Directors considered the impact on 
business relationships, in particular existing and late-stage pipeline 
customers. The Executive Directors communicated with the 
majority of customers to update them on the situation and reassure 
them that the Company would continue operating as usual.

The IBC thoroughly evaluated the offers, ensuring its commitment 
to treating all shareholders equally and maintaining the principles 
of equity and impartiality. The Senior Independent Director and 
Chair of the IBC, served as a point of contact for shareholders and 
provided oversight to ensure that governance practices remained 
robust and transparent. The Chair of the IBC facilitated 
communication between the IBC and the Board and ensured that 
Shareholder interests were protected and decisions regarding 
potential offers were made with their best interests in mind. 

Stakeholder

Outcome
EQT announced that it did not intend to make a firm offer to the 
shareholders of Alfa. Alfa confirmed that it had terminated 
discussions with THL.

significant Learning & Development 

projects, including the enhancement of 

training tools and opportunities through 

new libraries of content–featuring 

hundreds of self-serve learning courses–

and easy-to-access programmes. 

We made graduate programme 

improvements and end-of-placement 

process changes, as well as embedding 

our leadership development offering. 

We transferred all our historic training 

records to the new Learning Management 

System to give everyone a single view of 

their development journey.

Our Leadership Development 

programmes are enabling colleagues to 

further develop and hone the key skills, 

traits and characteristics needed to 

lead others effectively, helping us grow 

a culture where individuals and 

teams succeed.

Our focus on career progression centred 

on launching a new hub of content for 

our colleagues’ entire Talent Journey, 

and clear explanation of how to own 

their career, as well as how to have 

great development conversations.

Alfa was one of the sponsors for 
the STEMPossible event in 2023, 
held at the Michigan Science 

Center. This was put together by 

United Way for Southeastern 

Michigan and Tech United, and 

included 650 students (4th and 

5th grade) and 200 volunteers 

(including Alfa colleagues), 

allowing these students to 

explore science, technology, 

engineering and mathematics in 

a fun and engaging way, as well 

as learning about possible 

careers in these fields.

that might match their beliefs or personal

Alfa is involved with the Equipment 

Leasing & Finance Association 

(ELFA)’s Equity Committee in the US, 

which is committed to a continued 

focus on equity; is about developing 

a culture where everyone can feel 

valued, engaged and respected for 

what they do; and all are given the 

opportunity to achieve their career 

goals. By providing a platform to 

share experiences, we can learn 

from each other and make a real 

impact in removing barriers that 

limit the professional development 

of underrepresented minorities. 

Being an active member of the 

committee is one of the ways Alfa 

aims to help move our industry 

forwards, supporting and 

developing the diverse range of 

talent within our own organisation 

and in our network.

Our community of Mental Health Allies 

also publish a quarterly themed blog to 

share advice and resources to support an 

array of mental health considerations.

We tackle difficult subjects through social 

talks, blog posts and podcast episodes, 

and we are extremely proud that 

colleagues feel able to share their 

personal stories and experiences with 

each other at Alfa.

Our 2023 ‘Happy Wall’ project saw 

colleagues sharing gratitude for things 

that make them smile, professionally and 

personally, and sent a wave a positivity 

through all Alfa regions.

The Company, supported by the 

Board, is passionate about 

providing an inclusive workplace 

that promotes and values 

diversity, which is described in 

greater detail on pages 62-63. 

However, the Company recognises 

that the composition of the Board 

is not aligned with the 

recommendations which aim to 

improve diversity on Boards. The 

Nomination Committee agrees 

strongly with the principle of 

increasing diversity on Boards and 

will consider the importance of 

diversity, for both gender and 

ethnicity, when recommending 

new board appointments as they 

arise. Our external and internal 

board evaluations continue to 

show that the current board is 

effective and contains the right 

blend of experience and skills to 

deliver the Company’s objectives.

We take pride in our efforts to create a 

workplace that attracts talent, and retains 

dedicated individuals who contribute to 

our shared goals. Our focus on looking 

after our people isn’t just an initiative; 

it’s a continuous journey of improvement 

and support.

We attended numerous recruitment 

events throughout the year in the UK and 

US, as well as hosting several Insight Days 

which gave potential applicants 

the opportunity to experience Alfa prior 

to applying for a role. These events 

contributed to over 800 individuals 

applying to our next graduate 

programmes.

We have continued our employer brand 

activities with employee story campaigns 

celebrating our people, and have shared 

life at Alfa on our social channels 

throughout the year, giving insight into 

our workplace and what we offer.

We marked Engineering Day in 

November, raising public visibility of 

how engineers make a difference in 

the world, and celebrating how they 

shape the future. 

At Alfa we have plenty of engineers 

to be very proud of, and we took the 

chance to share some employee 

stories on our social channels. 

Colleagues also visited their children’s 

schools to talk engineering and take 

part in careers conversations.

In 2024 we will continue to execute our 

plans to improve diversity, inclusion 

and belonging across the organisation. 

Global connections will be improved with 

joined-up messages and changes to our 

intranet – giving regional views as well as 

global news updates for everyone. We’ll 

continue to partner with organisations 

that can help us access talent and boost 

our diversity, and we look forward to 

developing a new partnership with Niyo. 

We will kick off a new ‘Alfa Alumni’ 

programme to maintain relationships and 

strengthen our employer brand. This will 

maintain connections with the extended 

Alfa network, as well as support us in 

finding valuable referrals.

This year we hosted four Insight Days at 

our office in London, organised by HR 

and the ‘Alfa for Racial Equity Community’. 

The aim of these events is to attract and 

encourage top graduates to apply to Alfa’s 

graduate scheme in September, but also 

to give the students skills and knowledge 

they can add to their CVs while also 

helping us to increase the diversity of 

applicants. To do this, we include 

workshops focusing on two key areas 

of Alfa – Engineering and Consulting 

– which are run by colleagues working 

in these career paths. We also include 

a networking lunch to give the 

attendees a chance to meet people at 

Alfa, and an applications session to go 

through CVs, cover letters and Alfa’s 

application process.

The Insight Days we ran were:

•  Cambridge Brown Girls Link Up – April–

CBGLU is a Cambridge University 

society whose purpose is to promote 

unity and empowerment among 

women and non-binary people of South 

Asian descent. We hosted an Insight 

Day for 15 members of this society.

•  Female-only Insight Day – 20 female 

or non-binary students attended 

in September.

•  UpReach Insight Day – 20 students from 

lower socio-economic backgrounds 

attended in October.

•  NIYO insight day – November – NIYO 

is an organisation focused on the 

economic empowerment of black 

women. We invited 10 people who 

work with this organisation to attend 

this Insight day.

are most proud of at Alfa. This year we 

have fostered global connections, worked 

on communicating and knowledge-

sharing wherever we can, and enjoyed 

learning and networking at a host of social 

talks and events.

Our regular Town Hall updates and 

Company Meetings keep colleagues 

informed on all the news from around the 

business. Each region gathered for their 

annual two-day Company Conferences–in 

Charlotte, North Carolina for the US; in 

Byron Bay for Australia and New Zealand; 

and for EMEA in Brighton. These events 

always incorporate valuable time with 

colleagues, a chance to try something 

new, and networking opportunities to 

keep us all connected.

The US have held hugely successful ‘office 

weeks’ to encourage people to gather and 

work together during the days that 

surround in-person events. Of course, at 

Alfa, these involve treats and social time 

too. We will explore doing the same in the 

UK in 2024.

As Smart Working has now become 

the norm at Alfa, we are conscious of 

maintaining connections and ensuring 

everyone has what they need to work 

effectively and efficiently. We launched a 

identifying areas for improvement and 

celebrating our achievements. Over the 

year we saw our engagement score 

climb from 78% in Q1 to 82% in Q4 2023.

Each survey round featured an average 

return of over 100 positive shout-outs 

for colleagues doing great things and 

answers to the question ‘What is Alfa doing 

well?’. A Pulse Review Group, made up of 

members drawn from across Alfa, meets 

to discuss themes and patterns that may 

present themselves, as well as respond to 

comments and take actions forward.

We introduced the concept of ‘Flow’ to the 

business in 2023. Flow looks at ways, in all 

areas, to support the fast and efficient 

movement of high-quality work through 

our organisation.

In 2024 we will embed this theme in all 

areas of Alfa, helping our global teams 

to collaborate and work more effectively 

wherever possible.

The Alfa Podcast library launched in 

2022. We have enjoyed recording 

and sharing new episodes of our 

internal podcast throughout 2023.

Gender Equality

Gender Pay Gap %

This displays the median and mean (average) pay gap over the years

The gender pay gap 

analysis provided here is 

based on data reported in 

April each year. This data 

is up to and including 

5 April 2023. 

 The gender pay gap (GPG) is the measure 

of the difference in average pay between 

all men and women across an 

organisation, regardless of their role, 

level, length of service or location and any 

other differentiating factors. The GPG is 

reported as a mean average and median 

average (midpoint) figure. The GPG is 

different to the concept of equal pay 

which requires that women and men are 

paid the same for doing the same job and 

it is unlawful to pay people unequally on 

the basis of whether they are a man or 

a woman.

and £759 for KidsCan.

to use for volunteering. Some of the 

volunteering and charity work we’re most 

proud of in 2023 includes:

Alfa’s Finance Team spent a day 

volunteering with London based charity 

The Children’s Book Project. They 

sorted books, created bundles of books, 

compiled orders, made bunting, and 

helped get deliveries out.

The Children’s Book Project seeks to 

tackle book poverty and to give every 

child the opportunity to own their own 

book. They believe in empowering 

children to choose a book they are 

motivated to read and in the power of 

reading communities.

In 2023 we, once again, took part in the 

Adopt a Family initiative in the US. 

Colleagues contributed to gift lists for 

deserving families and also spent time 

wrapping and delivering presents for 

recipients. Alfa increased the scope of this 

programme from previous years and was 

pleased to support four families in 2023.

Outside fundraising drives, Alfa also 

donates £7.50 (or local equivalent) for 

every employee engagement survey 

returned during the year.

We have partner charities in each of our 

regions, voted for by colleagues: in EMEA,

and awareness for dozens of additional 

charities too. Alfa often matches 

donations and as a community we are 

supportive of everyone’s personal 

affiliations to many other good causes.

£29,986 was donated to a host or 

organisations outside our four main 

charity partners.

We’ve continued our partnership with 

Change Please, a charity that trains 

hundreds of previously homeless and 

unemployed individuals to become 

baristas, with over 85% going on to find 

ongoing employment, and that has 

provided thousands of nights of 

accommodation through fundraising. 

100% of Change Please profits fight 

homelessness. We are delighted that we 

continue to offer work experience to 

Change Please baristas in our London 

office cafe.

When Alfa colleagues become new 

parents we send baby clothing gifts using 

From Babies with Love, an organisation 

that channels 100% of profits to support 

orphaned and abandoned children 

around the world.

64

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023This year we have introduced Matchable, 

a global volunteering platform that 

matches colleagues with an enormous 

range of opportunities, depending on 

preferences.

Matchable presents an array of tasks 

that match with colleagues’ skills and 

interests or passions, identifies a suitable 

location to volunteer from (with many 

opportunities from home), and can offer 

short or long-term volunteering. All the 

volunteering opportunities align with our 

chosen UN SDGs.

We used our unspent Apprentice Levy 

funding for 2023 to support Making 

Space, a charity that provides adult health 

and social care services. We provided 

funding of £32,000 for their employees 

to complete adult care qualifications.

Since we started the scheme: 

•  We’ve raised £10,000 for our 

partner charities.

•  We’ve covered 15,000 miles under 

our own steam, more than the 

distance between our offices 

London and Sydney, and between 

London and Detroit combined. 

•  In just one month our ‘Alfaletes’ 

lifted over 200,000 kilograms in 

the gym.

•  In September 2023 we logged 40 

hours helping at the zoo, 70 hours 

working in our own gardens, and 

even had an Ironman logged. 

It’s exciting and rewarding learning 

what our team mates get up to, and 

we use the initiative to share and 

learn a little more about each 

other too. 

A final element is ‘Alfa Resolve’. 

This sees a smaller group of people 

come together as accountability 

buddies. They collectively commit to 

goals each week, share them, and 

support each other as they work 

towards them. 

There’s no defined criteria; 

it’s a simple support community, 

which has been popular with 

those involved. 

These are really rewarding 

initiatives for our team mates, 

which also benefit our charities 

as much as the activity 

benefits ourselves. 

Alfa Activity Challenge 
and Alfa Resolve 
Alfa has always had physically and 

creatively active employees. We 

wanted to combine our passion for 

sport and activity with raising funds 

for our charities – and that’s where 

Alfa Activity Challenge and Alfa 

Resolve were born.

Alfa supports this by pledging 

charity donations for each 

employee’s participation in an 

initiative that runs in January and 

September each year. For every 

mile we run, or bike, or hike, or 

swim, and for each hour we work 

out, or do crossfit, or any time 

based activity, Alfa donates an 

amount. The initiative even rewards 

each repetition when weight-lifting, 

with the final repetition earning 

more, because that should always 

be the hardest one! 

We are equally focussed on mental 

health at Alfa, so the initiative also 

rewards yoga, meditation, or any 

activity based on time spent that 

an employee feels benefits their 

mental wellbeing. Our Gympass 

membership provides some great 

options for meditation along 

with the obvious physical fitness 

related benefits.

Our Parents’ Community also got 

involved, encouraging colleagues to 

participate with their families. As a 

reward for being active as a family, 

children taking part multiply the 

funds raised at the same rates as 

an Alfa employee. Family dogs 

don’t earn extra donations for 

participation, but we know a 

walk makes everyone in the 

household happy.

to refine our measurements and 

improve accuracy.

In late 2023 we kicked off a supplier 

review for our carbon-offsetting partner, 

to ensure we are:

•  Supporting carbon reduction projects 

across the world, with a level of 

transparency on what the project 

is doing;

•  Ensuring the CO2-reducing projects that 
we support are verified by a legitimate 

standards agency; and

•  Not relying on tree planting (young 

trees are not sequestering enough 

carbon for offsetting).

the items were recycled.

500 trees were also planted on our behalf 

and the result of our total donations was an 
estimated 373,585KG CO2e offset/saving.

In addition to the donations we’ve made 

via KOcycle, we’ve also given refurbished 

laptops to Change Please (with whom we 

partner, offering work experience to their 

trainee baristas), and dozens of further 

laptops to other charities and schools.

Energy Efficiency Statement
We are committed to responsible carbon 

management and will practise energy 

efficiency throughout our organisation,

In 2023 we launched our improved 

supplier onboarding and approval 

process, embedding more ESG factors 

into supplier selection across Alfa. At the 

end of the year, in the spirit of continuous 

improvement, we reached out to the 

organisation for feedback on 

enhancements to this process.

Helping our clients to measure 
their GHG emissions
Alfa leads the market in many ways, 

and we are incredibly passionate about 

sustainability, so we’re delighted that from 

Alfa Systems v5.7.15, launched in 2023, we 

offer our customers new functionality to 

track and report on their portfolios’ Scope 

3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Scope 3 Reporting functionality applies 

to all types of vehicle, including both 

equipment and automotive portfolios. 

By including the feature in the existing 

Asset Management module, to which 

all clients already have access without 

needing to pay additional licence or 

maintenance fees, we are being as 

supportive as we can to our clients as 

they make their journeys to net-zero.

We set out below our climate-related financial disclosures that are based on the TCFD recommendations and recommended 

disclosures, in line with the requirements of LR 9.8.6(8)R. Where we have not adopted TCFD recommendations in full, such as in 

Strategy (c), we have explained the reasons. We have based our disclosures on the TCFD ‘Guidance for All Sectors’ and note that we 

do not operate in an industry for which the additional supplemental guidance applies.

For our TCFD disclosures, ’materiality’ is considered to be the threshold at which ESG issues become sufficiently important to our 

investors and other stakeholders that they should be disclosed. We believe that the audit materiality (as disclosed on page 136) 

meets this criteria and it is therefore the materiality we have applied. We will continue to assess our approach to ensure we remain 

relevant in what we measure and disclose.

Governance

a)  Describe the board’s 
oversight of climate-
related risks and 
opportunities.

The CEO has ultimate responsibility to the Board for all ESG matters.

Climate-related risks and opportunities were presented to the Audit and Risk Committee (made up of 
Board members) twice in 2023 (in June and December). In these meetings, the Board reviewed and 
discussed Management’s assessment of climate risks and opportunities, and was also updated on 
related progress on climate-related matters such as Alfa’s signing up to the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) – the details of which can be seen on page 66.

We believe that the impact of climate-related risks is not material and so whilst the Board has 
received two briefings in the year on ESG matters, it has not spent significant time considering 
climate-related risks and opportunities.

b)  Describe management’s 
role in assessing and 
managing climate-related 
risks and opportunities.

Climate-related risks and opportunities are embedded across our Operational Framework, 
including roles and responsibilities, key policies and processes. The CFO is responsible (at Company 
Leadership Team level) for the Group’s Environmental Policy and climate change issues, and he is 
supported by the ESG Steering Group and the Environmental Impact team.

In 2023, the CFO was closely involved in the climate-related risk assessment, the output of which was 
then discussed and debated with the rest of the CLT before being updated in the risk register. He also 
led the background work done behind Alfa’s emissions targets being validated by the SBTi, and going 
forwards (from 2024 onwards), he will be responsible for overseeing the work being done by Alfa 
towards meeting these commitments.

Our ESG Steering Group is made up of key individuals from different areas of the business globally, 
and it works on the development and delivery of ESG strategy, key policies and material 
commitments. Senior management, including the CFO and CPO, are part of this Group and brief the 
CEO and the wider CLT on the status and progress of projects. The ESG Steering Group discussed 
climate-related issues in nine meetings in 2023.

The Environmental Impact team, a group of volunteers from all levels of the Company, is responsible 
for the execution of organised activities and the monitoring of standards established to ensure 
adherence to our environmental goals. Initiatives recommended by this team (and subsequently 
implemented at Alfa in 2023) can be seen on page 66 and included park clean-ups, bicycle servicing 
and introduction of Terracycle bins in the London office.

Management is kept up to date on ESG matters in a number of ways – these are tailored by individual 
and, in 2023, included attending climate workshops and courses for professional development 
(such as Wired Impact and Asset Finance Connect: Transition from dirty assets to green).

For our October 2023 UK Company Day, management invited a team of climate experts to give a 
workshop on climate change to our EMEA-based employees.

Strategy

a)  Describe the climate-
related risks and 
opportunities the 
organisation has 
identified over the short, 
medium, and long term.

Management considered the risks outlined in Table A1.1 of the TCFD Implementation Guidance 
as part of carrying out this TCFD disclosure review. In addition, we also referred to the SASB 
(Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) sector-specific materiality assessment guidance for 
the Software and IT Services Industry which showed that, from an environment perspective, the 
key issue for our industry is Energy Management (which is in line with our current focus).

In general, we see little impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our business. This is 
reflective of our product, which is not significantly impacted by climate, and the fact that we already 
actively seek to manage and mitigate climate-related risks.

Alfa’s public commitment of signing up to the SBTi target reduction programme increases the 
reputation risk associated with not being able to reduce our emissions in line with our commitment 
– however, management is working closely with external advisors on our emissions reduction 
journey and is confident that Alfa will meet the targets set.

In the short term (2024-2026, which is consistent with our viability assessment period – see page 45) 
another risk that remains is management not keeping up to date with the various climate-related 
regulations – again, we continue to mitigate this risk by working closely with external advisors. For 
example, we are working with them on the impact of the recent Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme 
(Amendment) Regulations published in November 2023 on Alfa’s ESOS Phase 3 reporting.

In the medium (2026-2030) to longer (2030-2050) term, we see more positives for Alfa than 
negatives. In 2023, we released a new functionality in our software that helps customers track and 
report on their portfolios’ Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – this new feature started out 
as a Hackathon innovation idea (see page 69) and, after being selected as an investment priority 
by management, went live for our customers in November. A move towards new lower carbon 
technologies is likely to result in increasing requirements for asset backed finance solutions 
(as they are generally more expensive), which will drive growth in our underlying markets. 
In addition, increasing reporting requirements through the supply chain will require agile systems 
that can respond to the new reporting requirements, which will increasingly demonstrate the greater 
flexibility of Alfa Systems over competitor products.

b)  Describe the impact of 
climate-related risks 
and opportunities on 
the organisation’s 
businesses, strategy, 
and financial planning.

Most of our operations are in the UK and USA, and therefore these geographies will have the most 
impact on our climate-related risks and opportunities. We are acutely aware of our responsibility to 
contribute towards the global efforts to mitigate against climate change and are therefore actively 
looking to reduce our carbon footprint, including reducing travel to client sites, using renewable 
energy options in many of our offices, and considering travel distances and modes of transport for 
the location of conferences.

During 2023, we incurred expenditure related to reducing our emissions, e.g. in the US office, the 
lightbulbs were replaced to LED and a switch was made to new energy-efficient dishwashers. In the 
year we also purchased carbon offsets of 2,421 tCO2e from Ecologi – see page 67 for our approach 
to carbon offsetting. 

Our financial planning has also reflected our focus on climate. For example, our budget for 2024 has 
factored in additional costs for external advisors to carry out a supplier engagement exercise to help 
us get a better understanding of our supplier emissions.

To enable our systems to respond to increasing demands for multi-modal solutions and emissions 
reporting, and for Alfa to be viewed as a leader in sustainable financing solutions, we continue to 
spend time understanding the ESG-related needs of our customers and investment required in the 
product (as seen in the new GHG functionality mentioned above). We hope to recoup this investment 
through a combination of increased market share, as clients focus more on Scope 3 reporting and 
turn to ESG-compliant solutions, and increased licence revenue for more value-added, market-
leading products.

In 2024, we will work on making our Scope 3 emissions more accurate (e.g. with the supplier 
engagement planned), which will allow us to improve the quality of our reporting and also help us 
with monitoring our emissions.

Strategy 
continued

c)  Describe the resilience 
of the organisation’s 
strategy, taking into 
consideration different 
climate-related scenarios, 
including a 2°C or lower 
scenario.

We conducted a high-level qualitative climate change risk and opportunity analysis to obtain a better 
understanding of the climate issues that could impact the business in the future. Given the nature of 
our operations, we do not believe there are material risks to our organisation, other than the overall 
risk to the world economy. We therefore believe that our strategy as discussed on page 16 is resilient 
to climate-related factors, and so have not carried out quantitative scenario analysis.

Our focus in 2023 was to get a better understanding of our Scope 3 emissions, which means that we 
are now in a position to be able to report on all our relevant and key Scope 3 emissions for the first 
time (see page 73). 

Risk 
management

a)  Describe the 

organisation’s processes 
for identifying and 
assessing climate-
related risks.

Our approach to identifying, assessing and managing environmental risks, including climate-related 
risk, is embedded within our approach to risk management. Climate-related risks may present as 
financial or non-financial risks depending on the extent to which their impacts can be quantified, 
and how they have been classified.

As outlined on page 32, we have a comprehensive risk management process which includes a 
detailed assessment of our climate-related risks twice a year, along with a risk rating assigned to 
each risk which is then reviewed by management and the Board.

b)  Describe the 

organisation’s processes 
for managing climate-
related risks.

As above, in the short term, we do not see any material climate-related risks for the organisation. 
As a consequence, we keep the risks under review, but are not actively managing any at this point in 
time. We work closely with external advisors on climate-related matters and are therefore confident 
that this engagement helps mitigate the related risk (e.g. risk of not keeping up to date with 
climate-related regulations).

c)  Describe how processes 

for identifying, assessing, 
and managing climate-
related risks are 
integrated into the 
organisation’s overall 
risk management.

a)  Disclose the metrics used 
by the organisation to 
assess climate-related 
risks and opportunities 
in line with its strategy 
and risk management 
process.

b)  Disclose Scope 1, Scope 
2, and, if appropriate, 
Scope 3 greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, and the 
related risks.

c)  Describe the targets used 
by the organisation to 
manage climate related 
risks and opportunities

Climate-related risks are an integral part of our overall risk management and, in particular, are 
discussed when considering the corporate level risks.

Climate-related risks are the only risks that were discussed in detail in the second risk review in 
December 2023 despite having a low rating on the risk register – this reflects the importance that 
management and the Board give to climate and its impact on the business.

We have worked closely with the ESG Steering Group and other senior management to ensure that 
all climate-related risks are sufficiently covered in our risk register. Going forwards, the risk register 
will continue to be reviewed twice a year and updated for any changes to climate-related risks.

As explained on page 32, our risk management process gives a rating to each risk for its ‘probability’ 
and its ‘impact’, which together determine its overall risk rating. Twice a year, we review these ratings 
to ensure they remain appropriate.

The main climate-related data we monitored throughout the year was our energy usage – which (as 
per page 73) has gone down since 2022. Now that we have set the Group’s 2030 emissions reduction 
targets in line with SBTi, in subsequent years (2024-2025), we will establish interim metrics in line 
with our business strategy and risk management processes to monitor progress against the targets.

See page 73 for our SECR disclosure and page 69 for the methodology used. We disclose our Carbon 
Intensity Ratio on page 73, which is a metric used by the Group consistently since 2021, allowing us 
to compare the year-on-year ratios. It can be seen that our ratio has decreased despite an increase in 
revenue, which reflects lower emissions due to our new green salary sacrifice scheme – see below.

As above, 2023 is the first time that we have also disclosed all our relevant Scope 3 emissions. 
We continue to mature our approach to the quantification and understanding of the more complex 
Scope 3 emissions, e.g. the supplier engagement programme that will be carried out in 2024 will help 
us improve on the accuracy of our Scope 3 reporting.

To comply with the requirements for our SBTi submission via the SME route and to ensure that this is 
aligned with restricting an increase in global temperatures to 1.5ºC, this year we have set targets of 
reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by at least 42% by 2030 (compared with 2022 emissions).

Whilst we had not set targets for 2023 to monitor annual progress against, we note that our Scope 1 
and 2 emissions have decreased by 16% since 2022,which is reflective of our new green salary 
sacrifice arrangement that allows employees to only lease energy efficient vehicles.

Over 2024-2025, we will continue to progress in this area by setting appropriate interim targets 
linked to our 2030 targets, which will allow for effective comparison and measurement of emissions.

The Board is delighted that we have

and Governance
As Environmental, Social and Governance 

(ESG) initiatives continue to be developed, 

the Board will ensure that they remain

UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board closely monitors upcoming 

changes in governance and regulation. 

The Board acknowledges the publication 

of the 2024 Corporate Governance Code

1 January 2025. The Board will review 

any recommended amendments to 

governance arrangements and report on 

these in our Annual Report and Accounts 

for the year ended 31 December 2025.

All members of the Board will stand for 

re-election at the Annual General Meeting 

(AGM) in May 2024. All Board members 

have received a formal performance 

evaluation which demonstrated that each 

Director continues to be effective and 

committed to their role.

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023The UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018: 
Our compliance
This corporate governance statement, 

including the Nomination Committee, 

Audit and Risk Committee and 

Remuneration Committee Reports, 

explains how we have applied the 

principles and complied with the 

provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate 

Governance Code (the ‘Code’) during 

the year. Except for the matters which 

are explained below (in line with the 

‘comply or explain’ concept), the 

Company complied fully with the 

Principles and Provisions of the Code 

throughout the financial year in respect 

of which this statement is prepared and 

continues to do so as at the date of this 

statement. A copy of the 2018 Code, 

issued by the Financial Reporting 

Council can be found at www.frc.org.uk.

Exceptions to compliance
The Group has complied with the 

Code provisions during the financial 

year with the exception of:

Provision 9: The Chairman of the 
Board was not independent on 

appointment as he previously held 

the position of Chief Executive Officer 

and is the controlling shareholder 

of the Company. On listing, the 

Board unanimously supported 

and continues to support, the 

appointment of the Chairman to 

retain his skills and experience, and 

ensure continuity of service of Alfa’s 

customers and commercial partners.

Provision 41: The Company has not 
formally consulted with employees 

in forming the new Remuneration 

Policy, and is therefore not compliant 

with Provision 41 of the Code which 

requires details of engagement 

with the workforce to explain how 

executive remuneration aligns with 

the wider Company pay policy.

2023 AGM update
At the April 2023 AGM, the resolution to re-elect Chris Sullivan as a director was 

passed with lower support than expected from independent shareholders. Following 

consultation with a number of independent shareholders, the Board understands 

that the vote against Mr Sullivan was due to his position as Chair of the Nomination 

Committee and was the means by which the independent shareholders expressed 

their concern regarding the low female representation on the Board. 

The Board promotes an open, honest and inclusive culture in Board and Committee 

meetings, during which all Directors are encouraged to share their views based on 

their own different experiences and backgrounds. The Board listens and considers the 

matters before it, without bias or discrimination. As a result of the vote at the 2023 AGM, 

the Board undertook an extensive review of the composition of the Board and of the 

Directors’ relevant skills and experience, as part of our internal Board evaluation for 

2023. As a result of these actions, the Board remains confident that it currently has the 

right balance of backgrounds, skills and experience to fulfil the Company’s strategy. 

We endeavour to cultivate a Board which supports diversity of thought and ensures 

appropriate challenge, interpretation, and interactions between members. We celebrate 

differences and encourage differing perspectives when we approach all issues and tasks. 

The Board and the Nomination Committee are acutely aware of the requirements of the 

UK Corporate Governance Code and they are committed to ensuring that plans are in 

place for orderly succession to both the Board and senior management positions, and 

that they oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession. The Board and 

the Nomination Committee are committed to ensuring that the process for future 

Board appointments considers the importance of diversity in all its forms, including 
gender and ethnicity, in conjunction with the experience and skills required for the 

best balance of the Board and its Committees.

Board who may exercise all of the powers of the Company. The Board has a formal Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board

Board engagement 
A fundamental role of the Board is to 

consider the balance of interest between 

our stakeholders, including shareholders, 

our customers, our colleagues and the 

communities in which we operate. 

The Board recognises its responsibilities 

to engage with, and incorporate the views 

of, key stakeholders in strategic planning 

and decision making, and the importance 

of stakeholder trust in building resilience 

and long-term sustainability. Although 

the Board retains overall responsibility 

for stakeholder engagement, there is 

interaction at various levels of the 

business so that it is carried out by those 

most relevant to a particular stakeholder 

group or particular issue. The Board 

recognises the importance of considering 

all stakeholders in its decision making, 

although the weight given to each 

stakeholder group may vary depending 

on the subject in question. Through 

engagement and greater understanding 

of the interests of stakeholders, the 

Board is able to assess the long-term 

consequences of decisions on 

stakeholders and the business.

5 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance 

Code. We believe that our strong culture 

is a unique strength and we see the 

benefits in employee engagement, 

retention and productivity. This reflects 

the Alfa ethos that we are all striving 

towards the same goal and to reward our 

employees, Alfa operates a discretionary 

profit share scheme through which most 

employees share in a percentage of the 

profits of the Company.

Employee engagement survey

Our employee engagement survey, 

Pulse, remains an important tool to 

measure employee sentiment and 

identify areas for improvement and 

celebration of our achievements. 

Other stakeholder engagement
The Board and each Committee chair 

actively encourages and engages with key 

stakeholders and considers this to be 

paramount to the long-term success and 

performance of the business. During 

2023, there were no significant matters 

to discuss with shareholders in relation 

to the Nomination and Audit and Risk 

Committees. Our section 172 statement 

on pages 48 to 53 explains how section 

172 matters, including this engagement, 

are taken into consideration by the Board 

in its decision making. The Board 

recognises the contribution Alfa makes 

to society, the environment, and its key 

stakeholders. It seeks to understand their 

views and predominantly engages with 

them through the Executive Directors, 

who ensure that the Board is kept 

informed of any key issues or changes. 

It also keeps ways of engagement under 

constant review to ensure that they 

remain effective.

matters that the Board considers suitable 

for delegation are contained in the Terms 

of Reference of each Board Committee. 

There are certain key responsibilities that 

the Board does not delegate and which 

are reserved for its consideration. The 

full Schedule of Matters Reserved for the 

Board is available under the Corporate 

Governance section on our website.

The Company Secretary, through the 

Chairman, is responsible for advising 

the Board on all governance matters 

and for ensuring that Board procedures 

are followed, that applicable rules and 

regulations are complied with, and that 

due account is taken of relevant codes 

of best practice. The Company Secretary 

is also responsible for ensuring 

communication flows between the Board 

and its Committees, and between senior 

management and Non-Executive Directors.

Workforce policies and practices

Our people bring a diverse range of 

experience, expertise and perspectives 

that contribute to the values and culture 

of Alfa and are essential for the delivery 

of our strategic objectives. A positive 

environment where our people feel 

valued, motivated and able to thrive 

is essential to Alfa’s continued success. 

The Board recognises the value of, 

and supports, significant investment 

of time and resources in our colleagues 

to allow Alfa to attract and retain talent 

and develop the skills of our employees. 

One central policy in creating this 

environment and culture is Alfa’s Ethics 

and Code of Conduct Policy (the ‘Code 

of Conduct’) which clearly sets out a 

zero-tolerance policy for dishonest and 

corrupt behaviour among our employees 

and seeks to educate team members 

on unlawful and unethical conduct. 

Compliance with the policy maintains 

Alfa’s reputation in the marketplace 

as well as our relationship with our 

colleagues, investors, customers and 

other stakeholders. The Code of Conduct 

provides clear guidance to employees in 

respect of legal and ethical issues which 

they may come across while conducting 

Alfa business, and what Alfa expects in 

respect of our employees’ behaviour. 

It also provides important information 

on working at Alfa to help embed the 

behaviours and values alongside more 

practical information to enable our 

employees to work effectively and 

efficiently. The Board is responsible for 

overseeing the Company’s arrangements 

for the workforce to be able to raise 

matters of concern and seeks to foster 

an environment where individuals can 

be confident about speaking up about 

concerns without fear of retaliation. The 

Board monitors this area through reports 

on the number and types of concerns 

raised through the whistleblowing 

process and the outcomes of the 

concerns raised. Whistleblowing and 
incident reporting mechanisms are in 

place to allow issues to be formally 

reported and investigated.

for ensuring that Board decisions are implemented. He plays a key role in defining and guiding the 

strategy, once agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring the successful delivery against the strategic 

plan and other key business objectives, allocating decision making and responsibilities accordingly. 

The CEO is also tasked with providing regular operational updates to the Board on all matters of 

significance relating to the Group’s operations and for ensuring effective communication with

The Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board for the Chairman and acts as an 

intermediary for the Non-Executive Directors. The Senior Independent Director is available to 

shareholders should they have any concerns, where communication through normal channels has 

not been successful or where such channels are inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director 

meets with the Non-Executive Directors at least annually when leading the Non-Executive 

Directors’ appraisal of the Chairman’s performance.

The Non-Executive Directors bring insight and experience to the Board. They have a responsibility 

to constructively challenge the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors; scrutinise the 

performance of management in achieving agreed goals and objectives; and play leading roles 

in the functioning of the Board Committees, bringing an independent view to the discussion.

Unsolicited offers for the Company
As shareholders will be aware, we received a number of unsolicited proposals from 

EQT Fund Management S.à r.l (EQT) and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (THL). Following 

the initial approach from EQT, the Board decided to establish an Independent Bid 

Committee to consider matters relating to this approach and subsequent approach 

from THL. The Independent Bid Committee would principally decide whether or not to 

recommend the final terms of any offer to the Company’s shareholders in accordance 

with the requirements of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 

In addition to the scheduled meetings, there were four additional Board meetings 

arranged for the Board to review the offers from EQT and THL for the Company. In 

addition, the Independent Bid Committee met four times to discuss the approaches, 

with the relevant advisors in attendance. As announced on 7 July 2023, EQT reported 

that it did not intend to make a firm offer to the shareholders of Alfa. On 3 October 

2023, Alfa confirmed that it had terminated discussions with THL.

good governance is essential to support 

the delivery of Alfa’s strategic objectives, 

and to ensure that the business is run well 

for the benefit of all stakeholders and for 

sustainable long-term value. The Board 

receives an update on key elements of the 

People strategy which provides insight 

into a variety of areas including culture, 

diversity, inclusion, talent management, 

future capability, succession planning 

and colleague engagement. The Board 

continues to monitor the framework, so 

that it remains appropriate to the 

business. The governance framework 

embeds our values into the policies and 

processes of Alfa and therefore helps to 

strengthen the corporate culture.

Corporate governance

Having an effective corporate governance

The Board recognises the importance 

of a good culture and the role it plays in

Board leadership and Company purpose continued

Board and its Committees effectively 

oversee the business, maintain the 

highest standards of corporate 

governance and allow Directors to 

provide challenge where necessary.

The Board has overall responsibility for 

ensuring adequate resource is available for 

Alfa to deliver on its strategic priorities. 

The Board has established a risk 

management framework to manage and 

report the risks we face as a business, 

which are reviewed on at least an annual 

basis. The Board also undertakes a robust 

assessment of the Company’s emerging 

and principal risks. Efficient internal 

reporting, effective internal controls, and 

oversight of current and emerging risks are 

embedded into our business processes, 

which align to our strategic priorities, 

purpose and values. The Board, with the 

support of its Committees, places great 

importance on ensuring we achieve a high 

level of governance across the Group. 

Strategy
The Board provides support in 

at Alfa, providing employees with the 

opportunity to grow, experiment and 

innovate in an inclusive environment.

To create the right culture, it is important 

that employees live and breathe Alfa’s 

values, and this starts with our leaders. 

The Board sets the tone from the top to 

demonstrate and promote these values, 

which are a critical element in achieving 

our purpose of knocking down barriers 

so everyone can thrive. The Board uses 

several tools to monitor the culture, 

through surveys, Town Hall sessions, and 

formal and informal engagement activities. 

In addition, to monitor whether our culture 

is and remains aligned with our values, the 

Company seeks feedback from customers 

implementing strategic priorities as well as 

to understand what they experienced 

oversight and constructive challenge on the

running of the business. Through reporting,

including the use of both financial and 

and provision of services.

non-financial metrics, the Board is able 

to evaluate and guide the progress and 

performance of the Company. 

During the year, the Company has 

continued to embed across the business 

the purpose and values as set out in the 

Strategic report on pages 1 to 73 of this 

report. The Board continues to monitor 

the strategic direction of the Company 

and the key investments we need to make 

to remain in a leading position in an 

ever-changing market, and ensures we 

have the resources and the right people, 

in the right place operationally, to ensure 

we remain relevant to the markets in 

which we operate. This brings focus to 

strategic objectives and translates into 

better decisions, driving competitive 

advantage, stronger performance and 

a sustainable business model. 

Shareholders’ agreement
The relationship between the Board 

and the controlling shareholder of the 

Company (the ‘Controlling Shareholder’), 

CHP Software and Consulting Holdings 

Limited, is governed by the Relationship 

Agreement (dated 26 May 2017, as 

amended by deeds of adherence dated 

10 January 2024 and 15 January 2024). 

This agreement is a framework under 

which the Controlling Shareholder, and 

the shareholders of the Controlling 

Shareholder will operate to protect 

the rights of the non-controlling 

shareholders. There were no changes to 

the Relationship Agreement during 2023. 

As part of a corporate restructuring, the 

Controlling Shareholder entity changed 

from CHP Software and Consulting 

Limited to CHP Software and Consulting

Company’s shares.

One Non-Executive Director can be 

appointed to the Board for so long as 

the Controlling Shareholder holds 10% 

or more but less than 20% of the voting 

rights in respect of the Company’s shares.

If none of the Controlling Shareholders 

are members of the Nomination 

Committee, the Controlling Shareholder 

can appoint an observer to the Nomination 

Committee. Andrew Page is designated 

as the first appointed Director of the 

Controlling Shareholder. Andrew Denton 

has not been appointed as a designated 

Director by the Controlling Shareholder. 

It has been agreed that for as long as the 

Controlling Shareholder has the right to 

appoint two Directors to the Board, and 

whilst Andrew Denton is a Director of the 

Company, the Controlling Shareholder will 

not exercise its right to appoint a second 

Director to the Board. There have been no 

Board observers appointed either under 

the Relationship Agreement, or otherwise.

Agreement, see page 131 of the 

Directors’ report.

Prior to their appointment, prospective

the Company and their private interests 

and/or other duties. The Companies Act 

2006 provides that Directors must avoid 

a situation where they have, or can have, 

a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, 

or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s 

interests. Boards of public companies 

may authorise conflicts and potential 

conflicts, where appropriate, if their 

company’s Articles of Association permit.

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Chairman’s and Directors’ 
performance
During the year, the Senior Independent 

Director evaluated the performance of 

the Chairman. In addition, the Non-

Executive Directors met independently 

from the Executive Directors to discuss 

with the Chairman the overall functioning 

of the Board and the Chairman’s 

contribution in making it effective. 

In addition, the Chairman holds regular 

meetings with individual Directors at 

which, among other things, their 

individual performance is discussed. 

Informed by the Chairman’s continuing 

observation of individual Directors, these 

discussions form part of the basis for 

recommending the reappointment of 

Directors at the Company’s AGM, and 

include consideration of the Director’s 

performance, contribution and commitment 

to the Board and its Committees.

Board evaluation and performance review
To ensure the Board remains effective, a performance evaluation is carried out 

each year to review the effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and Directors. 

The Board recognises the benefit of a thorough evaluation process to reflect on its 

strengths and the challenges it faces, and to identify opportunities to continuously 

improve its effectiveness.

The evaluation for 2023 was conducted by the Company Secretary in conjunction with 

the Chairman. The Directors were asked to complete a detailed Board performance 

evaluation questionnaire to assess the performance of the Board and the Committees 

over the year. Each questionnaire was analysed and a summary of the results and the 

Board’s performance was presented to the Board for discussion.

The Board considers this exercise to be of significant value, and focus is placed on 

reviewing the quality of information provided to the Board at the Board’s discussions, 

the effectiveness of the Board, the composition of the Board, including the skillset 

of the various Directors, highlighting whether there are any gaps in the breadth and 

depth of the Board that should be addressed by the Nomination Committee as part 

of its succession planning, and to ensure that the Board is best placed to deliver on 

its strategic goals and ensure the long-term sustainable success of the Company.

The evaluation confirmed that there was a strong emphasis on the welfare of 

employees, with active consideration of fairness to employees and their rewards, 

and a recognition of the need to support wellbeing.

The overall conclusion of the evaluation was that the Board and its Committees remain 

strong and effective, with a clearly defined role and purpose. The evaluation found that 

the Board is chaired well, demonstrated by Board discussions which were rigorous and 

open, combined with constructive challenge, allowing for diversity of opinion.

Focus area
Education and training

Recommendation and plan
•  Maintain a commitment to ongoing learning and 

development opportunities as a Board.

Engagement

•  Facilitating increased contact between the Board 

and the business, and between the Non-Executive 

Directors and senior management colleagues. 

Consider building unstructured time between 

Board and Committee sessions.

Succession planning

•  Succession planning will continue to be an area of 

priority for the Board. Broaden focus on development 

of talent and succession mapping for CLT and senior 

management. Maintain focus on exposure of the Board 

to future leaders in the talent pipeline.

Risks and opportunities

•  Focus on continuing to enhance understanding of 

external and emerging risks, opportunities, and trends 

specific to Alfa and the industry, and developments 

and potential disrupters to the business. Maintain 

focus on Alfa’s competitive performance.

It is the Board’s policy that appointments 

to the Board will always be based solely 

on merit without any discrimination 

relating to age, gender or any other 

matter that has no bearing on an 

individual’s ability to fulfil the role of 

Director. This principle of Board diversity 

is strongly supported by the Board, 

recognising that diversity of thought,

consideration as part of the selection

Committee purpose and 
responsibilities
The Committee is accountable for 

reviewing the structure, size, and 

composition of the Board, and ensuring 

that the Board and its Committees have 

the most suitable balance of skills, 

knowledge, and experience, taking 

account of each individual Director’s time 

commitment. The Committee ensures 

that formal, rigorous, and transparent 

procedures are in place for Board 

appointments and that plans are in place 

for orderly succession planning to Board 

positions. It oversees the recruitment 

process and advises the Board on the 

identification, assessment, and selection 

of candidates; drives the diversity, equity, 

and inclusion agenda; and confirms that 

all appointments are made on merit 

against objective criteria.

The Committee also provides oversight 

on succession planning activities of 

senior management. The Committee 

is responsible for ensuring that a 

comprehensive induction programme is 

delivered on the appointment of a new 

Non-Executive Director and leads the 

annual evaluation process of the Board.

Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 

to present our Nomination Committee 

Report for 2023, which summarises our 

key activities during the year. 

During 2023, the Committee continued to 

recognise the importance of building an 

experienced, effective and open Board 

working together with the Company 

Leadership Team (CLT) to achieve Alfa’s 

strategic objectives. The Committee 

ensures that the Board and the CLT have 

the right balance of skills, knowledge 

and experience to both discharge 

their responsibilities and to respond 

appropriately to emerging challenges 

and opportunities. With this in mind, 

the Committee continued its succession 

planning for the Board, Executive 

Directors and CLT, and considered Alfa’s 

approach to the development of the 

wider talent pipeline and, in particular, 

key senior management.

The Committee acknowledges the 

importance that growing talent internally 

plays in the Company’s diversity 

ambitions. Directors are encouraged to 

contribute to the development of a 

diverse range of future leaders. The 

Committee increased its focus on the 

talent management and development of 

all Alfa employees. 

I, as Chair of the Nomination Committee, 

have overseen and extensively reviewed 

the composition of the Board and the 

Directors’ relevant skills and experience, 

to ensure that we have the right balance 

to fulfil the Company’s strategy. We 

recognise that an optimal board of 

directors should reflect a diverse range of 

views, insights, perspectives and opinions, 

which facilitates constructive discussion 

and enables enhanced decision making 

and effectiveness, and we believe that the 

current Alfa Board epitomises these 

principles. We promote an open and 

inclusive culture in Board and Committee 

meetings, where all Directors are 

encouraged to share their views and 

where their views are all considered, 

without bias or discrimination. 

The Committee and Board as a whole is 

mindful that the composition does not 

currently meet the requirements of the 

FCA’s diversity rules. For this reason, it 

pays particular attention in its oversight 

of employee engagement to ensure there 

are no cultural or structural barriers 

for women and ethnic and other under-

represented groups. It is satisfied that the 

Company continues to promote diversity, 

equity and inclusion, and it expects to see 

an increasingly diverse talent pipeline that 

will feed into its workforce with more 

people from minority groups.

Committee role and 
membership
The Committee comprises the Executive 

Chairman and the Non-Executive 

Directors, and is chaired by Chris Sullivan, 

the Senior Independent Director. The 

Nomination Committee is responsible for 

ensuring the composition and structure 

of the Board remains effective, balanced 

and optimally suited to the Company’s 

strategic priorities. In practice, this 

involves overseeing the nomination, 

induction, evaluation and orderly 

succession of Directors. This is achieved 

through effective succession planning, the 

identification and development of internal 

talent, and a clear understanding of the 

competencies and capabilities required 

to support the delivery of Alfa’s strategy. 

The Committee also ensures the 

Company’s governance structure 

facilitates the appointment and 

development of effective management 

that can deliver shareholder value over 

the long term.

The Committee’s performance was 

reviewed as part of the 2023 internal 

Board and Committee effectiveness 

review, which is detailed on page 89. 

The evaluation established that the 

Committee functions well in terms of 

planning succession to Board roles, 

Company Leadership Team and the 

future talent pipeline.

Skills and experience
During 2023, the Committee reviewed 

the balance of skills and experience 

of the Board. For Non-Executive 

Directors, independence in thought 

and judgement is vital to facilitating 

constructive and challenging debate 

in the boardroom and is essential to 

the operational effectiveness of the 

Alfa Board and its Committees. 

The Board is satisfied that it has the 

appropriate range of skills, experience, 

independence and knowledge of the 

Company to enable it to effectively 

discharge its duties and 

responsibilities.

The Directors completed a self-

capability assessment, which supports 

our ongoing succession planning 

work. The output is shown in the 

matrix below.

The chart below demonstrates the skills 

and experience of the Board members: 

For professional ongoing development, 

the Board receives presentations 

relevant to the Company’s business 

and updates on any changes to 

markets, or regulations, which may 

affect the Company’s operations.

The Company Secretary supplies all 

Directors with information on relevant 

corporate governance and best 

practice. As part of their annual 

performance evaluation, Directors 

are given the opportunity to discuss 

training and development needs. 

Additional training is available on 

request, where appropriate, so that 

Directors can update their skills 

and knowledge as applicable. The 

Committee is confident that Board 

members have the knowledge, 

ability and experience to perform 

the functions required of a Director 

of a listed company.

The Committee keeps under review the 

leadership needs of the organisation, and 

both the Executive and Non-Executive 

Directors, with a view to ensuring the 

continued ability of the organisation to 

compete effectively in the marketplace. 

The Committee undertakes comprehensive 

reviews of the leadership needs of the 

Company, to ensure the continued ability 

of the organisation to compete effectively 

in the marketplace, and keeps informed 

of the strategic issues and commercial 

challenges affecting the Company and 

the market in which it operates.

In addition, the wider talent and 

succession programmes remained a key 

focus of the Committee during the year. It 

evaluated the succession plans for the CLT 

and the senior management structure, 

and reviewed employees identified by 

management as having the potential to 

develop in the longer term into future 

leaders of the business, taking into 

account future challenges and 

opportunities. The Committee has 

ensured that there are plans in place for 

short and medium-term succession for 

the Board and CLT.

Meetings of the Committee are scheduled 

close to the end of the half and full year, 

as well as before the publication of the 

associated half-year and full-year financial 

reports, so as to ensure the Committee is 

informed fully, on a timely basis, on areas 

of significant risks and judgement. The 

Board has confirmed that it is satisfied

Fair, balanced and

The Committee has undertaken a careful 

review to ensure that the Annual Report is 

‘fair, balanced and understandable’ and 

provides the necessary information for 

shareholders to assess the Company’s 

consolidated position, performance, 

business model and strategy, in line 

with the requirements of the 2018 Code.

The Committee members were consulted 

at various stages during the drafting 

process and provided input at the 

planning stage, as well as having the 

2024 Committee meeting, any areas 

requiring additional clarity or better 

balance in the messaging. In forming its 

opinion and recommendation to the 

Board in respect of the above matters, 

the Committee assessed the following:

•  A qualitative review of disclosures 

and a review of internal consistency 

throughout the Annual Report 

and Accounts;

•  A review by the Committee of all 

material matters, as reported 

elsewhere in this Annual Report

•  Disclosures in relation to the Task Force 

on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

(TCFD);

•  A risk comparison review, which 

assesses the consistency of the

an update on audit activities, the progress

audits with action plans to address any 

issues. Activities of the internal audit 

during 2023 included the following areas 

of focus:

Independence and 
performance of the 
external auditor
The Committee is responsible for 

reviewing the independence of the 

Company’s external auditor, RSM, 

agreeing the terms of engagement 

and the scope of its audit.

•  Compensation approach

•  Pricing

RSM has a policy of partner rotation,

independence is maintained. The 

Committee reviewed a report from 

the external auditor describing its 

arrangements to identify, report and 

manage any conflicts of interest.

The Committee performed an 

effectiveness review of internal 

audit during the year.

As part of this review referenced above, 

and considering management’s opinion, 

the Committee was satisfied that the 

internal audit function remains effective 

and fit for purpose.

Maintaining an independent relationship 

with the Company’s external auditor is a 

critical part of assessing the effectiveness 

of the audit process. The Board has 

approved a policy which is intended 

to maintain the independence and 

objectivity of the external auditor. The 

policy, which was updated in the year, 

governs the provision of audit, audit-

related services and non-audit services 

provided by the auditor. Committee 

approval is required for any service with 

an expected cost in excess of £10,000. 

During 2023, the external auditor 

confirmed to the Committee that it did 

not provide any non-audit or additional 

services other than for the half-year 

Details of audit, audit-related fees and 

non-audit fees are included in note 9 to 

the consolidated financial statements.

The Committee notes that audit partner 

rotation every five years facilitates 

independence and objectivity within the 

External Audit team. The current External 

Audit Engagement Partner is Graham 

Ricketts, who was appointed to lead the 

audit in July 2020. The Committee is 

satisfied with the performance and 

effectiveness of RSM as external auditor, 

taking into account the Committee’s 

own assessment and feedback. The 

Committee has concluded that RSM 

displays the necessary attributes of 

independence and objectivity.

Assessment of the 
audit process
The scope of the external audit is formally 

documented by the auditor. It discusses 

the draft plan with management before 

it is referred to the Committee, which 

reviews its suitability and holds further 

discussions with management and the 

auditor before final approval. The 

Committee has reviewed the quality of 

the audit plan and related reports for 

the 2023 audit and is satisfied with the 

quality of these documents.

The Committee discussed the quality of 

the half-year review and audit work since 

RSM’s appointment and considered the 

performance of the external auditor, 

taking into account feedback from various 

stakeholders across the business and 

the Committee’s own assessment. The 

evaluation focused on: robustness of 

the audit process; quality of delivery; 

reporting; and people and services. The 

Committee reviewed the independence 

of the external auditor and concluded 

that it complies with UK regulatory and 

professional requirements and that its 

objectivity is not compromised.

Assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Committee
The Committee’s effectiveness in respect of 

2023 was evaluated as described on page 

89. The key issues that were identified in the 

Committee evaluation were discussed by 

the Committee to ensure these were 

adequately addressed and the Chair 

provided an update where appropriate.

Focus for 2024
In 2024, as well as the regular cycle of 

matters that the Committee schedules for 

consideration each year, the Committee 

will continue to monitor legislation and 

regulatory changes, including those that 

affect the audit market that may impact 

the work of the Committee. The 

Committee will also continue with 

oversight of internal audit activities 

and findings as well as monitoring the 

continued progressive enhancements 

to Alfa’s systems and internal controls.

Steve Breach
Chair, Audit and Risk Committee
13 March 2024

The Committee does not intend to put 

the external audit out to tender in the 

coming financial year as the appointment 

of RSM occurred in 2020 and therefore 

the Company has complied with the 

Competitions and Markets Authority 

requirement in relation to audit tenders 

every 10 years. The Committee will 

continue to keep this under review as 

part of its review of effectiveness of the 

external auditor.

Going concern and 
Viability statements
The Committee reviewed the updated 

wording of the Company’s longer-term 

Viability statement, set out on pages 45 

to 47. To do this, the Committee ensured 

that the financial model used was 

consistent with the approved three-year 

plan and that scenario and sensitivity 

testing aligned clearly with the principal 

risks of the Company. Committee 

members challenged the underlying 

assumptions used and reviewed the 

results of the detailed work performed. 

The Committee was satisfied that the 

analysis supporting the Viability 

statement had been prepared on an 

appropriate basis. The Committee also 

reviewed the going concern statement, 

set out on page 31 and confirmed its 

satisfaction with the testing methodology.

Introduction
On behalf of the Remuneration 

Committee, I am pleased to present 

our Remuneration Committee Report 

for 2023, which summarises our key 

activities during the year. This year, the 

Committee’s focus was on reviewing the 

current Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 

line with the Group’s long-term business 

strategy. In this Report, I have set out 

information on the business context and 

the wider operating environment, details 

of executive remuneration outcomes in 

2023, the intended implementation of 

the Policy for 2024 and the key focus 

areas for the Committee during 2023.

As we develop our ESG framework, we 

have set longer-term targets and will 

look to set interim shorter term targets 

in relation to our net-zero ambitions

With regard to the Group’s longer-term 

Incentives, performance conditions 

attached to Long-Term Incentive Plan 

(LTIP) awards made on 30 April 2021 were 

tested to 31 December 2023. The award is 

based equally on growth in EPS and Total 

Shareholder Return (TSR). TSR over the 

three-year period was 69.6%, which 

ranked Alfa at the 70th percentile against 

its benchmark. Diluted EPS for 2023 of 

7.9p exceeded the maximum target of 

7.6p. Accordingly, 91.95% of the award will 

vest in April 2024, and will be subject to a 

mandatory two-year holding period. 

Further details, including the value of 

these awards, are included on pages 111 

to 115. The Committee is satisfied that 

overall pay outcomes in respect of the 

year ended 31 December 2023 are 

appropriate and reflect Alfa’s strong 

financial and operational performance, 

and the experience of all key stakeholder 

groups. The annual bonus outcome for 

the year reflects strong financial 

performance in 2023, while vesting of the 

awards granted under the 2021 LTIP 

reflects long-term, strong performance 

for shareholders during the period. The 

Committee has therefore not exercised 

any discretion in relation to its 

assessment of the outcome of the 

variable pay schemes, or to overall 

remuneration levels this year.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy

The Alfa Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) is subject to a binding shareholder vote at the Alfa AGM to be held on 1 May 

2024 and, if approved, will apply from this date. It is intended that the Policy will apply for a period of up to three years and will need 

to be re-approved at the 2027 AGM at the latest. The Policy was reviewed and approved by the Remuneration Committee. As part of 

the process, the views of our larger shareholders and other shareholder advisory bodies were sought. In addition, the thoughts of 

other Board members, management and external advisors were considered. 

Changes from the current Policy
The key changes between this Policy and the policy which was approved by shareholders at the Alfa 2021 AGM are as follows:

•  Salary – Any increase in Executive Directors’ salaries will generally be no higher in percentage terms than for the broader 

employee population.

•  Company Share Options Plan – There is no intention to incentivise Executive Directors with a CSOP award. Removed from the 

2024 Policy.

•  Post-employment shareholding requirements – Directors are required to continue to hold their shareholding requirement or, 

if their level of shareholding is below the requirement, their actual holdings, for a period of two years. 

Any other changes in wording or presentation are considered to be immaterial to the operation of the Policy.

Fixed elements of remuneration for Executive Directors

Salary

Purpose and link 
to strategy

Operation

To attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of the calibre required to deliver the Company’s strategy and drive 
business performance. 

Base salaries will be reviewed at least annually, and assessed, taking into account the scope and requirements of the role, 
experience of the incumbent and the total remuneration package. Any increases will typically be effective from 1 January. 

Account will also be taken of the performance of the business, the salary increases awarded to the wider employee 
population, and remuneration arrangements in other listed companies of comparable scale and sector.

Maximum 
opportunity

There is no overall maximum for, or increase to, salary levels. Any increase in Executive Director salaries will generally 
be no higher in percentage terms than that for the broader employee population. In appropriate circumstances, the 
Committee may award increases outside this range. 

These may include: 

•  A change in role and/or responsibilities; 
•  Performance and/or development in the role of the Executive Director; and 
•  A significant change in the Company’s size, composition and/or complexity. 

In addition, where an Executive Director has been appointed to the Board at a starting salary which is lower than the 
typical market rate, larger increases may be awarded as their experience develops, if the Committee considers such 
increases to be appropriate.

Performance

Personal performance will be taken into consideration when determining any salary increases.

Benefits

Purpose and link 
to strategy

Operation

To provide market competitive benefits which help to recruit and retain high-calibre Executive Directors.

The Committee’s policy is to provide Executive Directors with competitive levels of benefits, taking into consideration 
the benefits provided to Alfa’s employees and those offered by its peers. Benefits are in line with those for the broader 
workforce and currently include (but are not limited to) private medical insurance for individual and family, (if applicable); 
and death-in service life assurance. The Company may award additional benefits where the Committee considers it 
appropriate (e.g. travel, accommodation and subsistence allowances). These may include national and international 
relocation benefits such as (but not limited to) accommodation, family relocation support and travel in line with our 
policy for other employees in similar situations.

Maximum 
opportunity

Given that the cost of benefits depends on the Executive Director’s individual circumstances, there is no prescribed 
maximum monetary value. 

The cost of the benefits provision will be reviewed by the Committee on a periodic basis to ensure it remains appropriate. 

Other payments such as legal fees or outplacement costs may be paid if it is considered appropriate.

Performance

There are no performance conditions.

Executive Directors to deliver the Company’s strategy.

contributions into this scheme (or such other arrangement the Committee determines has the same economic effect).

The maximum Company contribution for Executive Directors will not exceed the contribution (as a percentage of salary) 
available to the broader employee population (currently 6% of salary).

There are no performance conditions.

Variable elements of remuneration for Executive Directors 

Annual bonus and Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP) 

Purpose and link 
to strategy

Operation

Incentivises and rewards the achievement of annual financial and non-financial objectives integral to the Company’s strategy. 

The part deferral of earned bonus into shares provides alignment with shareholders’ long-term interests.

The Committee will set the performance measures and their weighting, and targets annually to reflect the key financial 
and non-financial priorities for the business in the relevant year. 

Annual bonus outcomes will be determined by the Committee, and the Committee may use its discretion at the end of 
the performance period to adjust the final bonus outcome if it considers that the outcome does not reflect the underlying 
performance of the business during the year, or if it considers the payment is not appropriate in the context of unforeseen, 
unexpected or exceptional circumstances. 

Where exercised, the rationale for this discretion will be fully disclosed to shareholders in the relevant Annual Report. 

Not less than 50% of any bonus will normally be satisfied by way of an award of shares under the DBSP. 

Deferred shares will be subject to a three year holding period from the date of the award, but no further performance 
conditions will apply. Directors may sell sufficient shares to satisfy the respective tax liability but must retain the net 
number of shares until the end of this three year period. 

Malus and clawback provisions will apply (see explanatory notes).

Maximum 
opportunity

The maximum bonus opportunity may be up to 150% of salary for the Executive Directors for each financial year. On-target 
performance will typically pay out up to 50% of the maximum opportunity. 

Performance

Full details on the annual bonus for Executive Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration in respect 
of the relevant year. 

Performance measures will comprise a combination of financial and non-financial objectives, and the measures may vary 
from year to year. At least half of the annual bonus will be based on financial measures. The non-financial performance 
measures may include a combination of strategic and/or personal objectives. 

Further details on, and the rationale for, the measures used in the annual bonus will be disclosed in the relevant Annual 
Report (and the targets set will normally be disclosed retrospectively, subject to these being considered not to be 
commercially sensitive).

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Purpose and link 
to strategy

Operation

Incentivises and rewards the achievement of the Company’s long-term strategic objectives for the business, through the 
use of share-based awards. Encourages long-term shareholdings to retain Executive Directors and provide alignment with 
shareholders’ interests.

Awards granted under the LTIP vest subject to the achievement of applicable performance conditions measured over at 
least a three-year period. LTIPs may be made as conditional share awards or in other forms (e.g. nil cost options) if it is 
considered appropriate. 

The Committee may use its discretion at the end of the performance period to adjust the final vesting outcomes if it 
considers that the formulaic outcome does not reflect the underlying performance of the business during the 
performance period, or if it considers the payment is not appropriate in the context of unforeseen, unexpected or 
exceptional circumstances. Where exercised, the rationale for this discretion will be fully disclosed to shareholders in 
the relevant Annual Report. 

Awards that vest are subject to a further two-year holding period after the vesting date. Directors may sell sufficient 
shares to satisfy the respective tax liability but must retain the net number of shares until the end of this two-year period. 

The Committee retains the discretion to allow dividends to accrue over the vesting period in respect of any awards that 
vest (see explanatory notes).

Maximum 
opportunity

The maximum value of shares (at grant) which can be made under an award to an individual in respect of a financial year is 
150% of salary.

Performance

Performance measures will be determined by the Committee at the time of making each award to ensure alignment with 
the long-term success of the business. 

The performance conditions may include, but are not limited to, market measures, financial measures, and strategic 
long-term objectives. 

For performance between threshold and maximum, awards vest on a straight-line basis. 100% of an award will vest for 
maximum performance and typically 25% will vest at threshold.

All-employee share plans

Purpose and link 
to strategy

Operation

Maximum 
opportunity

Performance

All-employee share plans are designed to encourage share ownership across the wider workforce.

Executive Directors are eligible to participate in any all-employee share plan, on identical terms to other participants. 
In the case of UK tax qualifying plans, these will be operated in line with HMRC guidance.

Participation in any approved all-employee share plans will be subject to the same limits as for other eligible employees and, 
in the case of any UK tax qualifying plan, will be subject to the maximum limits permitted by the relevant tax legislation.

The Committee may apply conditions to participation in all-employee share plans, which will apply to all employees.

Shareholding requirement

Purpose and link 
to strategy

Operation

Maximum 
opportunity

To drive long-term, sustainable decision making for the benefit of the Company and our shareholders.

The Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding equivalent to 200% of salary to align with the long-term 
interests of shareholders. Until the requirement is met, 50% of any share awards vesting (after any sales to cover tax 
liabilities) should be retained.

Executive Directors are required to hold shares equivalent to 200% of their salary in value.

Post-employment, Executive Directors will normally be expected to maintain a minimum shareholding of 200% of 
salary (or actual shareholding if lower) for two years. The Committee retains discretion to waive this guideline if 
it is not considered to be appropriate in the specific circumstance.

Performance

There are no performance conditions.

Non-Executive Director remuneration

Fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors 

Purpose and link 
to strategy

Fees are set at a level to reflect the amount of time and level of involvement required in order to carry out duties as 
members of the Board and its Committees, and to attract and retain Non-Executive Directors of the highest calibre 
with relevant commercial and other experience.

Operation

Fees for Non-Executive Directors will be determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. 

Additional fees are payable for acting as Senior Independent Director, Committee Chairs, or for undertaking other duties. 
Fee levels will be reviewed (though not necessarily increased) annually and set with reference to the time commitment and 
responsibility of the position as well as taking into consideration market data for roles in other companies of a similar size 
and complexity. 

Benefits appropriate to the role may be provided. The Non-Executive Directors will have the benefit of a qualifying third 
party indemnity from the Company and appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. Travel and reasonable 
expenses incurred (including any tax gross-up) in the course of performing their duties may be paid by the Company 
or reimbursed.

Maximum 
opportunity

Details of the current fee levels for the Non-Executive Directors are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. There 
is no prescribed maximum annual increase. Total fees will not exceed the maximum amount provided in the Company’s 
Articles of Association.

Performance

There are no performance conditions.

Prior arrangements 
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising any 

discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above 

where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the relevant individual (or other person to whom this Policy applies) 

was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual 

becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes, ‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable 

remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. 

108

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Selection of performance conditions
For the annual bonus, the Committee believes that a mix of financial and non-financial targets is most appropriate for the Company. 

Strategic and personal objectives may be included where appropriate to ensure delivery of key business milestones. The Committee 

will determine the measures and weightings each year, based on the key financial and strategic priorities for the Company. 

Performance under the LTIP will typically be based on a combination of market and non-market measures. This is so that the 

Committee can assess the Company’s performance with reference to a mix of underlying financial and stock market performance, 

and encourages a focus on long-term financial growth as well as returns to shareholders. The Committee will keep the measures 

and weightings under review prior to the start of each cycle to ensure that these remain effective in driving the Executive Directors 

to deliver long-term success. 

Explanatory notes 
Awards under any of the Company’s share plans referred to in this report may: 

a.  Be granted as conditional share awards or nil cost options or in such other form that the Committee determines has the same 

economic effect; 

b.  Have any performance conditions applicable to them amended or substituted by the Committee if an event occurs which causes 

the Committee to determine an amended or substituted performance condition would be more appropriate and not materially 

less difficult to satisfy;

c.  Incorporate the right to receive an amount (in cash or additional shares) equal to the value of dividends which would have been 

paid on the shares under an award that vests up to the time of vesting (or where the award is subject to a holding period, time of 

release). This amount may be calculated assuming that the dividends have been reinvested in the Company’s shares on a 

cumulative basis; 

d.  Be settled in cash at the Committee’s discretion – although the Committee has no intention to cash settle any Executive Directors’ 

awards and would do so only in exceptional circumstances (such as where there was a regulatory restriction on the delivery of 

shares) or to settle tax liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition of shares; and 

e.  Be adjusted in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or any demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event 

that may affect the Company’s share price. 

Discretion, malus and clawback
Our incentive plans provide the Committee with discretion in respect of vesting outcomes that affect the actual level of reward 

payable to individuals. Such discretion would only be used in exceptional circumstances and, if exercised, the rationale for this 

discretion will be fully disclosed to shareholders in the relevant Annual Report. 

Variable pay awards may be made subject to adjustment events. At the discretion of the Committee, an award may be adjusted 

before delivery (malus) or reclaimed after delivery (clawback) if an adjustment event occurs.

Malus will apply to awards under the DBSP and LTIP. Clawback will apply to all vested awards under the DBSP and LTIP and the part of 

the annual bonus which is paid in cash. These provisions may be invoked at the Committee’s discretion at any time within three years 

of the payment of cash bonuses and six years of the grant of DBSP and LTIP awards. 

109

Financial statementsOther informationStrategic reportCorporate governanceRemuneration Committee Report
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued

The Committee has the discretion to invoke these provisions in the following circumstances: 

•  Where there is a material misstatement of any Company financial results;

•  Where an error in assessing performance conditions is discovered;

•  Where there is misconduct on the part of the individual; and

•  Where a material failure of risk management by the Company is identified, or in the event of serious reputational damage 

to the Company. 

Shareholding requirement 
The Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding equal to at least 200% of salary, to align with the long-term interests 

of shareholders. Until the requirement is met, 50% of any share awards vesting (after any sales to cover tax liabilities) should be 

retained. In order to generate alignment with shareholders beyond departure and to drive risk-conscious stewardship, a post-

cessation shareholding requirement will be placed on Executive Directors. The post-cessation requirement relates to those awards 

awarded through incentive schemes by the Company. Executive Directors will typically be required to maintain a shareholding equal 

to the lower of their in-post guideline and their actual holding, for two years.

Approach to recruitment remuneration 
The Committee will seek to align a new Executive Director’s remuneration package with the Policy as set out in the Policy table. When 

determining a remuneration package for a new appointment, the Committee will take into consideration the size and scope of the 

role, the skills and expertise of the candidate, the external market rate for a candidate of that experience, as well as the importance 

of securing the preferred candidate. Benefits will be limited to those outlined in the Policy, with relocation assistance provided where 

appropriate. Awards under the LTIP that may be awarded to a new Executive Director will not exceed 200% of salary and the bonus 

opportunity will not exceed 150% of salary. Special consideration may be given in the event that incentives accrued at a previous 

employer are due to be forfeited on the candidate’s leaving that company, in which case the Committee retains the discretion to 

grant awards with vesting on a comparable basis to the likely vesting of the previous employer’s award; any such award is excluded 

from the maximum value of incentives referred to above. For internal candidates, long-term incentive awards granted in respect of 

the prior role would be allowed to vest according to their original terms. For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 

Director, the fee would be set in accordance with the approved Policy in force at that time. The length of service and notice periods 

would be set at the discretion of the Board, taking into account market practice, corporate governance considerations and the skills 

and experience of the particular candidate at that time. 

Service contracts and appointment letters 
The service contracts of the Chairman and the Executive Directors do not have a specific duration but can be terminated by not less 

than six months’ notice in the case of the Chairman and the COO and by not less than 12 months’ notice for the CEO and CFO by 

either party. Under the service contracts, the Executive Directors are entitled to a salary (reviewed annually), pension contribution 

and benefits, in addition to reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties. 

The service contracts for Executive Directors make no provision for termination payments, other than for payment in lieu of salary. 

The Non-Executive Directors’ appointments are for a fixed term of three years and are subject to annual re-election by shareholders. 

Under their letters of appointment, their appointment is terminable by either party on three months’ written notice except where the 

Non-Executive Director is not reappointed by shareholders, in which case termination is with immediate effect. The Non-Executive 

Directors are entitled to the reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.

Termination of office 
If the employment of an Executive 

Director is terminated, any compensation 

payable will be determined by reference 

to the terms of the service contract in 

force at the time. As variable pay awards 

are not contractual, treatment of these 

awards are determined by the relevant 

rules. The Committee may structure any 

compensation payments beyond the 

contractual notice provisions in the contract 

in such a way as it deems appropriate. 

The Company may at its discretion make 

termination payments in lieu of notice 

and contractual benefits. The service 

agreements for the CEO, CFO and COO 

allow for garden leave during their notice 

period. The appointment letters for the 

Non-Executive Directors provide that no 

compensation is payable on termination. 

The Committee has a policy framework 

for payments for loss of office by an 

Executive Director, in relation to the 

service contract and incentive pay 

through the annual bonus and LTIP, 

which is summarised on page 112.

the original release date. If the participant dies, options 
will normally vest at the time of their death on the same

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Change of control policy 
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the LTIP awards will vest to the extent determined by the Committee taking into 

account the extent that the Committee determines that the performance conditions have been satisfied and, unless the Committee 

determines otherwise, the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed. DBSP awards will normally be released in full, 

unless the Committee determines otherwise. Alternatively, the Committee may permit an Executive Director to exchange their 

awards for equivalent awards over shares in a different company. If the change of control is an internal reorganisation of the 

Company, Executive Directors will ordinarily be required to exchange their awards (rather than awards vesting), and the Committee 

may also require the exchange of awards in other circumstances, as it considers appropriate. If other corporate events occur such 

as a winding-up of the Company, demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which, in the opinion of the Committee, may 

materially affect the current or future value of the Company’s shares, the Committee may determine that awards will vest on the 

same basis as set out above for a change of control. 

Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee consulted with the Company’s largest shareholders prior to finalising this Policy. The Committee will continue to 

monitor shareholder views when setting future executive remuneration strategy and will consult with shareholders prior to any 

significant changes to the Policy. The Committee takes full account of the guidelines of investor bodies and shareholder views 

in determining the remuneration arrangements in operation within the Company. 

Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company 
The Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of the wider employee population across the Company when 

setting Executive Director remuneration, and considered this as context when reviewing the Policy. While the Committee has not 

consulted employees directly on the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, the Committee is made aware of information such 

as workforce demographics, diversity initiatives, training programmes, engagement levels and cultural initiatives, as well as the 

remuneration principles and policies that apply to the wider workforce. It is expected that future salary increases for Executive 

Directors will be ordinarily no greater in percentage terms than those awarded to the general employee population, except in 

exceptional circumstances. 

Members of the Company Leadership Team are invited to participate in the LTIP, in order for there to be alignment between the 

objectives of the Executive Directors and senior management. We also continue to encourage employees to become investors in 

the Company by retaining legacy share awards and through its all-employee share schemes. 

External appointments 
Executive Directors may hold external directorships if the Board determines that such appointments do not cause any conflict of 

interest. Where such appointments are approved and held, it is a matter for the Board to agree whether fees paid in respect of the 

appointment are retained by the individual or paid to the Company.

Governance in practice

The Remuneration Committee is committed to good corporate governance and as such takes into account a broad range of factors 

when determining its Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The Committee considered both legal and regulatory requirements,

2021 LTIP awards which will vest on 29 April 2024 following the achievement of the TSR and EPS targets for the three-year period ended 
31 December 2023. The value of these awards has been calculated using the three-month average share price to 31 December 2023 of 1.55p.

All-employee workforce remuneration at Alfa 
The Committee takes into consideration the reward, incentives and conditions available to colleagues when considering the 

remuneration of Executive Directors and senior management. Our remuneration principles are consistent for all our employees. The 

key difference in our executive remuneration, compared to the approach to remuneration across our workforce, is that remuneration 

for our Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and linked to the delivering of strategic objectives.

Approach to remuneration across Alfa

Salary

Set considering market rates, roles, skills, experience, and individual performance. Alfa continues 

to review salaries Company-wide to ensure that we remain a competitive employer within the 

Allowances and benefits

local market.
Alfa provides a number of financial benefits and allowances, including travel insurance, life 

Pension

Annual incentives

Long-term incentives

assurance, smart working allowance and Company loan scheme.
Alfa offers employees access to a Self Invested Personal Pension, in which Alfa will match employee 

contributions up to 6%.
Alfa operates a discretionary profit share bonus scheme which reflects the Alfa ethos that we are all 

striving towards the same goal and share in the profits of the Company.
Senior grades participate in a long-term incentive arrangement, with both performance shares and 

restricted shares, recognising the markets in which we compete for talent. At other levels, awards 

are typically made in restricted shares only.

During the year, the Committee received reports from the Chief People Officer on pay and conditions across Alfa, and on 

the recruitment and retention experience. We took these into account when determining executive remuneration. We have 

established channels in place to inform our colleagues and help them understand how executive remuneration and wider pay 

policies are aligned, although we continue to develop how best to engage with employees. Further detail on Alfa’s approach to 

employee engagement is provided on page 52.

Rewarding our people and wider workforce engagement
Alfa’s approach to all-employee reward is focused on providing a competitive package to attract, retain and incentivise our 

employees to deliver for our customers, business and shareholders. Salaries for Executive Directors, senior managers and the rest 

of the workforce are all determined with reference to the same factors such as technical expertise, experience and performance, 

and increases across these populations are reviewed to ensure they are broadly aligned. The Committee also took an active role 

in determining rewards for the Company Leadership Team. Further information on key initiatives for our people and what makes 

Alfa unique can be found in the People section on pages 52 to 66. In addition to a competitive salary, all employees receive the 

opportunity to earn a performance-related bonus, private medical care, matched contribution pension and death-in-service life 

assurance. The Company Leadership Team and certain employees are eligible to participate in long-term incentive schemes. During 

the review of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Committee sought input from the Executive Directors, ensuring that any 

conflict of interest was suitably mitigated. It was concluded that the existing model of base salary; annual bonus; and a three-year 

LTIP with a two-year holding period was well understood by the business, supported Alfa’s culture and continued to be appropriate 

to drive business performance going forward.

Context to remuneration decisions
The Committee’s decision-making this year has taken into account a range of internal and external factors including the Committee’s 

responsibility for reviewing remuneration and related policies for employees throughout the Group. This ensures we take the reward, 

incentives and conditions available to colleagues into account when considering the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior 

management. The business acted in line with the section 172 governance guidelines while continuing to deliver exceptional results 

for shareholders. In particular, the Committee was mindful that: (i) During the year the Board upgraded estimates to shareholders 

and the continuing strong cash generation enabled the payment of two special dividends along with the regular dividend to 

shareholders; and (ii) The business has continued to take appropriate actions to support our colleagues and neutralise the impact on 

business performance of the effects of the macroeconomic climate and continued uncertainty surrounding the impact of, in 

particular, the rise of interest rates, inflation and increasing energy costs.

116

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Base salary
The Committee determined that the salary increase for the CFO, Duncan Magrath, and COO, Matthew White, for the period from 

1 January 2023 would be 5%. The Chairman, Andrew Page, and CEO, Andrew Denton, continued to receive the legal minimum salary 

requirement, which reflected the London Living Wage.

2023 annual bonus
The 2023 annual bonus performance measures were selected to reflect the Company’s annual and long-term objectives and its 

financial and strategic priorities, as appropriate. Performance targets are set to be stretching, taking into account a range of 

reference points, including the Company’s budget and third party analyst forecasts, as well as the Group’s strategic priorities. 

Duncan Magrath and Matthew White both participated in the 2023 annual bonus (which combines a cash award and conditional 

deferred shares award). The Executive Chairman and CEO have waived their entitlement to a bonus for the 2023 performance year.

In respect of the annual bonus, the targets were weighted towards financial metrics, with 75% of the award measured on the revenue 

and operating profit of the Company. The outcome of this element of the bonus can be decreased by a modifier based on the 

operating free cash flow conversion, being cash flow generated from operations after deducting capital expenditure as a percentage 

of operating profit EBIT. A new ESG measure was introduced for the 2023 annual bonus. The ESG measure consists of two individual 

elements, one assessing overall employee retention and the other overall employee engagement, which have a combined weighting 

of 5% of total bonus opportunity. The remaining 20% is subject to achievement of individual personal objectives. Further details on 

performance outcomes for the non-financial measures are shown in the second table.

The following table sets out the targets, actual performance against these targets and accordingly, the applicable pay-out for the

Performance against non-financial measures
We introduced our first annual bonus ESG performance measures in 2023, which assessed two individual elements, one overall 

employee retention and the other overall employee engagement. Both achieved measures which have a combined weighting of 5% 

of total bonus opportunity. 

Employee engagement, based on the average quarterly results from the 2023 Pulse survey, achieved 80.5%. This assessment of 

employee engagement underpins our commitment to addressing any concerns proactively, thereby prioritising employee well-being. 

Such prioritisation is essential for achieving high employee retention and cultivating a loyal and motivated workforce. In 2023, our 

retention rate stood at 97%, exceeding the threshold of 90%. This accomplishment reflects our ongoing efforts to create a positive 

and fulfilling work environment, which serves as a fundamental metric for our company’s sustained success and stability. Together, 

these metrics highlight our commitment to maintaining a consistent and engaged workforce.

The Committee considered a performance assessment report for the CFO and COO showing the extent of their achievement against 

the individual personal strategic and operational measures agreed by the Committee. As with the financial elements of the Annual 

Bonus, the Committee was satisfied that the scale of Executive Directors’ achievements this year. The personal measures described 

above are assessed with reference to the following objectives:

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Performance against annual bonus targets
Based on the achievements listed above, the Committee agreed that the final vesting under the 2023 bonus would be 51.0% 

of the maximum for Duncan Magrath and 52.1% of the maximum for Matthew White. In confirming this outcome, the Committee 

took into consideration the broader financial and operational performance of Alfa during the year, and the strong and effective 

leadership demonstrated by the Executive Directors. It was determined that no adjustments were required to the formulaic 

outcome. In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, 50% of these bonus amounts will be paid in cash, with the remaining 

50%, after deduction of tax, to be deferred into an award of Alfa shares with a minimum holding period of three years.

Long-Term Incentive Plan – awards vesting in the year
Awards granted to Executive Directors in April 2021 were subject to EPS growth and relative TSR performance over a three-year 

period ended 31 December 2023.

The EPS targets (applying to 50% of each award) required EPS for the year ending 31 December 2023 of 5.4p for 25% of that element 

to vest, rising to full vesting if EPS for the year ending 31 December 2023 was 7.6p or higher. The Group’s 2023 EPS outturn of 7.9p 

warrants 100% vesting of this element of the award.

The TSR element (applying to 50% of each award) required the Group’s three-year TSR performance to rank at median against the 

constituents of the FTSE Small Cap index (excluding investment trusts and the Company) for 25% of that element to vest, rising to 

full vesting if Alfa’s TSR ranked at or above the upper quartile against the comparator group. Alfa’s TSR over the period was 69.6%, 

which was at the 70th percentile versus the comparator group. This outcome warrants 83.9% vesting of this element of the award.

The Committee determined, after careful consideration of business performance and the interests of Alfa’s stakeholders such as 

shareholders, customers, and employees, that the formulaic outcome was appropriate. Consequently, 91.95% of the total award 

will vest.

Awards are scheduled to vest on 29 April 2024, and both Executive Directors’ awards will be subject to a two-year holding period, 

with a release date of 29 April 2026. Details of the awards to Executive Directors are set out in the table below:

Straight-line vesting occurs between threshold and maximum for both TSR and EPS elements of the award.

The three-year period over which performance will be measured begins on 1 January of the year the awards are granted and ends on 

31 December of the third year. Any awards vesting for performance will be subject to an additional two-year holding period, during 

which malus and clawback provisions will continue to apply.

Pension entitlement
The only element of remuneration that is pensionable is basic annual salary. A cash payment in lieu of pension contributions are 

payable to the CFO and COO, at a rate of 6% of salary as aligned with the broader workforce.

External appointments
Executive Directors are allowed to accept one appointment outside the Company, with the prior approval of the Board. Any fees may 

be retained by the Director, although this is at the discretion of the Board. During 2023 and up to the date of this report, none of the 

Executive Directors who held office during the year under review held external appointments for which they received a fee.

Payments for loss of office
There were no payments for loss of office during the year or prior year.

Payments to past Directors
There were no payments to past Directors for loss of office during the year or prior year.

Disclosure for all Directors in addition to the CEO has been added in 2020 in line with the requirements under the EU Shareholder 

Rights Directive II and, over time, a five-year comparison will be built up. Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC employs only the

CEO pay ratio
The table below sets out the pay ratios for the CEO in relation to the equivalent pay for the lower quartile, median and upper 

quartile employees (calculated on a full-time equivalent basis). The ratios have been calculated in accordance with the Companies 

(Miscellaneous Reporting) Requirements 2018. The CEO pay ratio data will be built upon annually until a rolling 10-year dataset is 

produced. The methodology adopted for calculating the ratio was ‘Option A’ which entailed calculating the total full-time equivalent 

(FTE) pay and benefits for all UK employees on the 2023 payroll. Employees were then ranked based on their FTE remuneration 

from low to high in order to identify those whose remuneration placed them at the 25th, 50th (median) and 75th percentile points. 

The CEO’s single total figure of remuneration (STFR) was then measured against these percentiles, to produce the three pay ratios. 

Option A was chosen because it was deemed to be the most statistically accurate method for this reporting purpose. Having 

reviewed the analysis, the Company believes the median pay ratio to be consistent with the Company’s general employee pay, 

reward and progression policies. The Company carries out annual salary reviews and annual reviews of benefits packages. Salary 

awards are made with reference to the outputs of annual industry benchmarking exercises. As per guidance, data relating to 

employees who left part way through the year and/or employees on secondment were excluded from the data set and analysis. 

Information calculated as at 31 December 2023.

This is the fifth financial year in which the Company has reported information on ratios between CEO and average staff pay under 

the amendments to the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations in 2018. There has been a significant decrease in the pay 

ratio, due to the fact that the CEO agreed to reduce salary to the minimum level in December 2021. As a result, the CEO’s STFR is 

lower in 2022 and 2023 than in previous years. 

Notes:
1.  The CEO advised the Committee that due to his holding in CHP Software and Consulting Holdings Limited, the main significant shareholder in the 
Company, he elected to reduce his salary to the minimum statutory level of remuneration with effect from 1 December 2021. This resulted in the 
CEO’s SFTR being lower in 2022 and 2023 than in previous years. 

2.  The CEO has waived his right to any bonuses or LTIPs, the value of any employee equivalents have been excluded from the employee remuneration 

figures used.

3.  Total remuneration includes benefits receivable during the relevant financial year and principally include life assurance, travel insurance and private 

medical insurance.

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and scheme interests
Executive Directors are expected to build and hold Alfa shares of at least 200% of their annual salary to align with the long-term 

interests of shareholders, with a requirement to retain 50% of any share awards vesting until the 200% requirement is met. 

Under the Policy, a post-employment shareholding requirement will apply whereby 100% of the shareholding requirement 

must be held for the first year following departure from Alfa and 50% for the second year. There are no share ownership 

requirements for the Non-Executive Directors. Shareholding requirements and the number of shares held by Directors during 

the year and as at 31 December 2023 are set out in the table below:

1.  Calculated using the share price of £1.40 (as at 29 December 2023).
2.  Duncan Magrath and Matthew White elected to join the Company ShareSave share scheme for which an option to acquire 11,718 ordinary shares 

at an option exercise price of £1.536 per ordinary share was granted on 30 November 2021. Subject to certain conditions being satisfied, the 
entitlement to exercise the ShareSave option arises during the period 1 January 2025 to 30 June 2025.

3. The 2021 LTIP awards (which vest based on performance to 31 December 2023) will vest on the third anniversary of grant on 29 April 2024.

There have been no changes to shareholdings of the Directors between the year end and the date of this report.

Dilution
Awards under Alfa incentive plans may be satisfied by treasury shares, shares held by the employee benefit trust, the issue of new 

shares or the purchase of shares in the market. Under Investment Association guidelines, the issue of new shares or reissue of 

treasury shares under a plan, when aggregated with awards under all of a company’s other schemes, must not exceed 10% of the 

issued ordinary share capital (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in any rolling 10-year period. As at 31 December 2023, 

no new shares or reissue of treasury shares had been used to satisfy awards, and so this limit had not been exceeded.

All-employee share plans
The Company proposes to issue a new ShareSave Scheme each year and all Executive Directors will be entitled to participate on the 

same basis as all other employees.

Relative importance of spend on pay

Implementation of the Remuneration Policy 2024
2024 Executive Directors’ base salary

The Executive Directors’ salaries were reviewed in December 2023. The Chairman, Andrew Page, and CEO, Andrew Denton, indicated 

that they would continue to receive the legal minimum salary requirement, as they are significant shareholders in the Company and 

want to align their future remuneration with those of the other shareholders. The base salary of the Chairman and CEO will increase 

by 10% as at 1 January 2024 to remain in line with the London Living Wage.

In 2022, the Company undertook a review of the Company car scheme and decided that the Company car scheme would be 

disbanded to promote the use of low emission vehicles or other forms of transport. For employees who were eligible to receive a car 

cash allowance, this was rolled into salary with effect from 1 January 2023. To align the Executive Directors with eligible employees, 

the car allowance benefit of £6,000 will be rolled into salary with effect as of 1 January 2024.

The Committee carried out a review of the CFO‘s and COO’s remuneration packages in December 2023 and determined that there 

would be a base salary increase of 1.8%. 

The table below shows the salaries for the Executive Directors as at 1 January 2024, which includes an adjustment for car allowance, 

which will be rolled into salary as of 1 January 2024, and the salary increase in comparison to base salary at 1 January 2023:

2024 annual bonus
The Chairman and CEO have elected to waive their bonus opportunity. The CFO and COO will be entitled to a maximum annual bonus 

of 125% of salary for 2024. The following measures have been selected for the 2024 annual bonus performance year:

Measure
Operating profit
Revenue
Operating free cash flow conversion
Personal performance
ESG

Weighting
37.5%
37.5%
Modifier
20%
5%

The Committee determined that the existing Bonus measures of revenue, operating profit and personal objectives continue to be 

appropriate for the business. 

Each bonus measure has a target. Failure to meet a minimum percentage of the revenue and operating profit target will result in no 

bonus being awarded for that element. Achieving a stretch of operating profit and revenue target will result in the maximum bonus 

being awarded under the formula (subject to the minimum operating profit target being achieved). The operating profit and revenue 

bonus elements can be decreased by the operating free cash flow conversion modifier, if cash performance falls below target based 

on a 24-month period. The ESG measure would consist of two individual elements, one will assess the overall employee retention 

and the second will assess a number of diversity initiatives, the achievement of which, will be evaluated on the overall progress at the 

end of the year. The ESG measure will have a combined weighting of 5% of total bonus opportunity.

As described earlier, the final determination is made by the Committee taking all available factors into account. The detailed bonus 

targets for the coming year are considered to be commercially sensitive. However, the Committee will provide an appropriate 

explanation of the bonus outcomes in the 2024 Directors’ Remuneration Report. In accordance with the Policy, 50% of any bonus 

earned will be deferred into shares for a three-year holding period.

126

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 20232024 Long-Term Incentive Plan
The award opportunity will remain at 150% of salary for the CFO and 100% of salary for the COO. Following vesting, awards will be 

subject to a subsequent holding period of two years, with the entirety of any award vesting released after two years. For 2024, the 

Executive Chairman and CEO have elected to waive their LTIP opportunity. The maximum LTIP opportunity under the Policy is 150% 

of salary.

The Committee has agreed TSR and EPS measures for the LTIP, with an equal weighting applied to each measure. EPS targets have 

been calculated based on growth targets from previous year’s actual EPS. The EPS targets set for the 2023 LTIP grant ignored the 

unfavourable impact from the changes in the UK Corporation Tax rate. Despite pre-tax profits in 2023 being higher than 2022, the 

impact of changes in tax rates means that EPS in 2023 was lower than 2022. Consequently, applying the same growth targets to the 

2023 EPS figure has resulted in lower EPS targets for the 2024 LTIP grant compared with the 2023 LTIP grant. 

The comparator group for the TSR is the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap index, excluding investment trusts. Median performance 

over the three-year performance period will result in 25% vesting, with 100% vesting if upper quartile performance is achieved. In 

each case, threshold vesting will be 25% of the maximum. Straight-line vesting occurs between threshold and maximum for both TSR 

and EPS elements of the award.

Pension and benefits
For 2024, the CFO and COO, in lieu of a pension contribution, will receive a cash allowance of 6% of salary in line with the pension 

contribution available to the wider workforce. As outlined on page 126, from 1 January 2024, the Company car allowance for the CFO 

and COO would be rolled into base salary. There are no further changes proposed to the benefits provided.

2024 Non-Executive Director remuneration
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company’s share incentive arrangements, nor do they receive any benefits. 

Fees for Non-Executive Directors are reviewed annually, and are set by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. Following the 

annual review of Non-Executive Director fees, no changes are proposed for the 2024 fees. It was determined that the fees will remain 

at the following level:

Base fee
Additional fee for chairing Audit and Risk Committee or Remuneration Committee 

(subject to maximum fees of £65,000)
Fee for the Senior Independent Director (including chairing Committees)

£55,000

£10,000
£65,000

Remuneration Committee membership
All current members of the Committee are deemed to be independent. Accordingly, the Committee continues to comply with the 

independence requirements set out in the Code. During 2023, there were four formal meetings of the Remuneration Committee, 

all of which achieved full attendance by the Committee members.

The responsibilities of the Committee are set out in the corporate governance section of the Annual Report on pages 74 to 134. 

The Executive Directors and the CPO may be invited to attend meetings to assist the Committee in its deliberations, as appropriate. 

No person is present during any discussion relating to their own remuneration or is involved in deciding their own remuneration.

During the year, the Remuneration Committee and the Company retained independent external advisor to assist on various aspects 

of the Company’s remuneration and share schemes. The Company has continued to retain the services of Ellason LLP as external 

advisors to the Committee for executive remuneration advice and updates on market practice. Ellason’s fees for 2023 were £19,845 

(2022: £23,790). Ellason do not provide any other services to the Group or any of the Directors, and the Committee is satisfied that 

they remain independent. Ellason is a member and signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct, which 

requires that its advice be objective and impartial and does not have any other connection with the Company or its Executive 

Directors.

Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for 

preparing the Strategic report and 

the Directors’ report, the Directors’ 

Remuneration report and the financial 

statements in accordance with applicable 

law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to 

prepare Group and Company financial 

statements for each financial year. The 

Directors have elected under company 

law to prepare group financial statements 

in accordance with UK-adopted 

International Accounting Standards. The 

Directors have elected under company 

law to prepare the company financial 

statements in accordance with United 

Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 

Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 

Standards and applicable law).

The group financial statements are 

required by law and UK-adopted 

International Accounting Standards to 

present fairly the financial position and 

performance of the group; the Companies 

Act 2006 provides in relation to such 

financial statements that references in 

the relevant part of that Act to financial 

statements giving a true and fair 

view are references to their achieving 

a fair presentation.

Under company law the Directors must 

not approve the financial statements 

unless they are satisfied that they give a 

true and fair view of the state of affairs of 

the Group and the Company and of the 

profit or loss of the Group for that period.

In preparing each of the Group and 

Company financial statements, the 

Directors are required to:

a.  select suitable accounting policies and 

then apply them consistently;

b.  make judgements and accounting 

estimates that are reasonable and 

prudent;

c.  for the Group financial statements, 

state whether they have been prepared 

in accordance with UK-adopted 

International Accounting Standards;

d.  for the Company financial statements, 

state whether applicable UK accounting 

standards have been followed, subject 

to any material departures disclosed 

and explained in the Company financial 

statements; and

e.  prepare the financial statements on 

the going concern basis unless it is 

inappropriate to presume that the 

Group and the Company will continue 

in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping 

adequate accounting records that are 

sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 

and the Company’s transactions and 

disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 

time the financial position of the Group 

and the Company and enable them to 

ensure that the financial statements and 

the Directors’ Remuneration Report 

comply with the Companies Act 2006. 

They are also responsible for 

safeguarding the assets of the Group and 

the Company and hence for taking 

reasonable steps for the prevention and 

detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Directors’ statement pursuant 
to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors, whose names 

and functions are listed on pages 78 to 79 

confirm that, to the best of each 

person’s knowledge:

a.  the financial statements, prepared in 

accordance with the applicable set of 

accounting standards, give a true and 

fair view of the assets, liabilities, 

financial position and profit of the 

Company and the undertakings 

included in the consolidation taken 

as a whole; and

b.  the Strategic report contained in the 

Annual Report includes a fair review 

of the development and performance 

of the business and the position of 

the Company and the undertakings 

included in the consolidation taken 

as a whole, together with a description 

of the principal risks and uncertainties 

that they face.

The Directors are responsible for the 

maintenance and integrity of the 

corporate and financial information 

included on the Alfa Financial Software 

Holdings PLC website.

Legislation in the United Kingdom 

governing the preparation and 

dissemination of financial statements 

may differ from legislation in other 

jurisdictions.

Independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Alfa Financial Software Holdings plc

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Alfa Financial Software Holdings plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the 

‘group’) for the year ended 31 December 2023 which comprise the Consolidated statement of profit or loss and comprehensive 

income, Consolidated statement of financial position, Consolidated statement of changes in equity, Consolidated statement of cash 

flows, Company statement of financial position, Company statement of changes in equity and notes to the financial statements, 

including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group 

financial statements is applicable law and UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. The financial reporting framework that 

has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 

Standards including Financial Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” 

(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion: 

•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 

2023 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;

•  the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards;

•  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 

Accounting Practice; and

•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 

responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 

section of our report. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 

relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest 

entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 

evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the group and 

parent company financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 

(whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation 

of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 

of the group and parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 

separate opinion on these matters. 

Revenue recognition – software and services revenue from implementation projects

Key audit matter 
description

The Group’s operations include complex software implementation programmes and service 

activities. The delivery of these contracts typically extends over more than one reporting period, 

and often the original project plans are amended as the implementation progresses. In recognising 

revenue, management has to apply a number of judgements to allocate the overall transaction 

price across the multiple performance obligations that have been identified within these projects. 

We consider revenue recognition for software and services revenue for implementation projects to 

be a key audit matter due to:

•  The level of judgement involved in the identification of distinct performance obligations and 

subsequent measurement of revenue and timing of recognition;

•  The degree of estimation involved in determining some inputs for inclusion in software and 

services implementation revenue calculations;

•  The potential risk of fraud in revenue recognition;

•  The allocation of audit resources and effort. 

Further details on revenue recognition are included in the financial statements in note 1.5 

“Accounting policies – Revenue recognition”, note 2 “Critical accounting judgements, estimates and 

assumptions” and note 5 “Revenue from contracts with customers”.

How the matter was 
addressed in the audit

In response to this key audit matter, the audit procedures we performed included:

•  Obtaining an understanding of the processes and controls around revenue recognition; 

•  Examining the group’s revenue recognition policy, including supporting accounting papers, to 

assess whether performance obligations have been appropriately identified and revenue 

recognised in line with IFRS 15;

•  For software implementation revenue (software and services) we: 

•  Assessed management’s analysis of the performance obligations within individual contracts 

and of how the five steps in IFRS 15 should be applied;

•  Audited the revenue recognition calculations for a sample of the most significant contracts to 

assess whether the methodology applied was consistent with the group’s revenue recognition 

policy and across projects. This included testing inputs in the calculations to supporting 

evidence; 

•  Examined a sample of underlying contracts to confirm the relevant contract terms had been 

appropriately identified and that the group’s new subscription-based contracts which involve 

implementation work were appropriately accounted for in line with the group’s subscription 

accounting policy;

•  Verified the explanations and data provided by management by holding discussions with 

project managers regarding the key assumptions and judgements made, in particular around 

the estimates of the projected costs to complete and the completeness of any contract 

arrangements, including any unusual terms and contract modifications;

•  Tested the completeness and accuracy of timesheet data as some performance obligations 

are recognised based on days worked;

•  Challenged management on the appropriateness of estimates made in IFRS 15 calculations for 

projects with perpetual licences. This included assessing the results of management’s analysis 

of the sensitivity of the calculations to these estimates;

•  Assessed specific contract key judgements including management’s treatment of any contract 

modifications and whether these were recognised appropriately in line with IFRS 15.

•  Auditing the disclosures in the financial statements and evaluating whether the policy for 

revenue recognition is appropriately explained and critical judgements and key sources of 

estimation uncertainty are appropriately disclosed. 

Key observations

Based on the results of the audit procedures outlined above, we have no observations to report. 

The impacts of the key judgements and estimates applied in respect of revenue recognition are 

disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements. 

No key audit matters were identified in respect of the Parent Company.

138

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Our application of materiality
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we set certain thresholds which help us to determine the nature, timing and extent of 

our audit procedures. When evaluating whether the effects of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a 

whole, could reasonably influence the economic decisions of the users we take into account the qualitative nature and the size of the 

misstatements. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality as follows:

An overview of the scope of our audit
The group has operations located in the following countries:

•  United Kingdom

•  United States of America

•  Germany

•  Australia

•  New Zealand

Although the structure of the group is made up of a number of legal entities, we have assessed that the group is a single component 

for the purposes of our audit because financial information is presented to management and the Board on a consolidated basis 

and the group’s financial statements report a single segment and do not disclose any specific divisional information. The group’s 

principal activity is consistent across all locations with a commonality of operations and there is operational interdependence 

across the group.

Our audit approach covers 100% of profit before tax, revenue and total assets. All audit work was completed by the group audit team 

and no component auditors were used in our audit.

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther informationIndependent auditor’s report to the members

Conclusions relating to going concern 
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 

preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and parent 

company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

•  Checking the arithmetic accuracy of the forecasts that form the basis of the directors’ going concern assessment and 

Viability statement;

•  Corroborating the cash balance that is used as the starting point for the forecasts by confirming to bank confirmations;

•  Challenging management’s forecasts and comparing the 2024 budget to YTD results and order book;

•  Assessing the assumptions made in management’s stress-testing;

•  Completing further sensitivity analysis and stress-testing of management’s forecasts;

•  Auditing the disclosures in the financial statements in respect of going concern and viability.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 

individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern 

for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In relation to the entity reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or 

draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it 

appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of 

this report.

Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 

report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annal report. Our opinion on the 

financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do 

not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 

with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise 

to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 

is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 

Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 

prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

•  the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

140

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course 

of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 

you if, in our opinion:

•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 

from branches not visited by us; or

•  the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 

with the accounting records and returns; or

•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Corporate governance statement
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate 

Governance Statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 

specified for our review by the Listing Rules.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 

Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

•  Directors’ statement with regards the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 

uncertainties identified set out on page 31;

•  Directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is 

appropriate set out on pages 45-47;

•  Director’s statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meets its 

liabilities set out on pages 46; 

•  Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 100;

•  Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 32;

•  Section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on 

page 100; and

•  Section describing the work of the audit committee set out on pages 95-102.

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement on page 134 the directors are responsible for the preparation of 

the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors 

determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 

fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to 

continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 

accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 

alternative but to do so.

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther informationIndependent auditor’s report to the members

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 

is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 

material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 

or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 

financial statements.

The extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. The objectives of our audit are to obtain sufficient 

appropriate audit evidence regarding compliance with laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the determination of material 

amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, to perform audit procedures to help identify instances of non-compliance with 

other laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements, and to respond appropriately to identified or 

suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations identified during the audit. 

In relation to fraud, the objectives of our audit are to identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements 

due to fraud, to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud 

through designing and implementing appropriate responses and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified 

during the audit. 

However, it is the primary responsibility of management, with the oversight of those charged with governance, to ensure that the 

entity’s operations are conducted in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations and for the prevention and detection 

of fraud.

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud, the group audit 

engagement team:

•  obtained an understanding of the nature of the industry and sector, including the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group 

and parent company operate in and how the group and parent company are complying with the legal and regulatory frameworks;

•  inquired of management, and those charged with governance, about their own identification and assessment of the risks of 

irregularities, including any known actual, suspected or alleged instances of fraud;

•  discussed matters about non-compliance with laws and regulations and how fraud might occur including assessment of how and 

where the financial statements may be susceptible to fraud.

The most significant laws and regulations were determined as follows:

Legislation/Regulation

Additional audit procedures performed by the Group audit engagement team included:

UK-adopted IAS, FRS 102 and 
Companies Act 2006

•  Review of the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation;

•  Completion of disclosure checklists to identify areas of non-compliance.

Tax compliance regulations

•  Inspection of advice received from internal/external tax advisors;

•  Consultation with a tax specialist regarding the approach taken to the audit of tax;

•  Consideration of whether any matter identified during the audit required reporting to an 

appropriate authority outside the entity.

Audit procedures performed by the audit engagement team:

Revenue recognition

The audit procedures performed in relation to revenue recognition are documented in the key 

audit matter section of our audit report for implementation software and services revenue. In 

respect of ongoing software and services revenue our procedures included:

•  Recalculation of the revenue recognised in the year for a sample of customers based on time 

worked and other supporting information;

•  Examining disclosures made in the financial statements to determine if these have been made in 

line with IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’.

Capitalisation of 
development costs

•  Examining the Investment Committee meeting minutes for any projects which may indicate the 

understatement of amounts capitalised during the period;

•  Interviewing relevant personnel to understand the projects capitalised in the period and the 

nature of projects not capitalised;

•  Verifying the amounts capitalised during the year by reference to underlying payroll records and 

timesheet data.

•  Examining for a sample of projects whether these had been accounted for in line with IAS 38 

‘Intangible assets’.

Management override 
of controls 

•   Testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; 

•   Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a 

potential bias; 

•  Evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the 

normal course of business.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 

website at: http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Other matters which we are required to address
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by management in July 2020 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ending 31 December 2020 and subsequent financial periods.

The period of total uninterrupted consecutive appointments is 4 years, covering the years ending 31 December 2020 to 
31 December 2023.

The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company and we 
remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting our audit. 

Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee in accordance with ISAs (UK).

Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.

As required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.1.14R, these financial 
statements will form part of the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) prepared Annual Financial Report filed on the National 
Storage Mechanism of the UK FCA in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard (‘ESEF RTS’). This auditor’s report provides 
no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared using the single electronic format specified in the ESEF RTS.

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther informationNotes to the consolidated financial statements  
for the year ended 31 December 2023

1.  Summary of significant accounting policies
This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. 

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The financial statements are for 

the Group, consisting of Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC (Alfa or the Company), its subsidiaries and joint venture, and are 

presented to the nearest £0.1m unless otherwise stated.

The principal activity of the Group is to provide software solutions and consultancy services to the auto and equipment finance 

industry in the United Kingdom, North America, Europe, Australasia and Africa. 

1.1  Basis of preparation
Compliance with IFRS 

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and with 

United Kingdom adopted International Accounting Standards.

Historical cost convention 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, other than the revaluation of 

financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at fair value through profit or loss. 

Going concern 

The financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis. The Group continues to be cash-generative and the Directors 

believe that the Group has a resilient business model. The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its cash 

reserves generated from operating activities. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes 

in trading performance, show that the Group has sufficient cash reserves to continue to operate for a period of not less than 12 

months from the date of these financial statements. 

The going concern assessment also includes downside stress testing in line with FRC guidance which demonstrates that even in the 

most extreme downside conditions considered reasonably possible, given the existing level of cash held, the Group would continue 

to be able to meet its obligations as they fall due.

On this basis, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 

financial statements.

New and amended standards adopted by the Group 

In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards issued by the International 

Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2023. 

Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements. The 

amendments relevant to the Group are:

•  Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction;

•  Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates;

•  Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Disclosure of Accounting policies; and

•  Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 – Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture. 

New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted 

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRS Standards 

that have been issued but are not yet effective:

•  Amendments to IAS 1 – Non-current liabilities with covenants; Amendments to IFRS 16 – Leases on sale and leaseback; 

Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – Supplier finance; and Amendments to IAS 21 – Lack of Exchangeability. 

The adoption of these is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

148

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 20231.2  Group structure
Basis of consolidation

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has 

rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 

the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 

Unless otherwise stated, subsidiaries have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares, and the proportion of ownership 

interests held equals the voting rights held by the Group. The country of incorporation or registration is also each subsidiary’s 

principal place of business.

All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. All subsidiaries have 

a 31 December year end.

The Group exercises control over the employee benefit trust because it is exposed to, and has a right to, variable returns from this 

trust and is able to use its power over the trust to affect those returns. The trust is therefore consolidated by the Group. 

Joint arrangements

A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is 

subject to joint control; that is, when the relevant activities that significantly affect the investee’s returns require the unanimous 

consent of the parties sharing control.

Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, and exists only when decisions about the activities 

that significantly affect the arrangement’s returns require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Judgement 

is required in determining this classification through an evaluation of the facts and circumstances arising from each individual 

arrangement. Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures based on the rights and obligations 

of the parties to the arrangement. In joint operations, the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities 

relating to the arrangement, whereas in joint ventures, the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. 

Alfa only has one joint venture, namely Alfa iQ Limited, which was formed in May 2020. The investment in the joint venture is 

accounted for using the equity method. The Group’s share of the joint venture’s net profit/(loss) is based on its most recent financial 

statement drawn up to the Group’s balance sheet date. The total carrying value of investment in the joint venture represents the cost 

of the investment, including loans which form part of the net investment in the joint venture, plus the share of post-acquisition 

retained earnings and any other movements in reserves less any impairment in the value of the investment.

The carrying values of joint ventures are reviewed on a regular basis and if there is objective evidence that an impairment in value 

has occurred as a result of one or more events during the period, the investment is impaired. The Group’s share of the joint venture’s 

losses in excess of its interest in that joint venture is not recognised to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive 

obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are 

eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same 

way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

Loans to the joint venture are measured at fair value on initial recognition, and subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any surplus 

between the nominal and fair value of the loan is recognised as an investment in the joint venture.

As explained on page 10, the activity in Alfa IQ is being brought fully into the Group. As a result, the Alfa iQ joint venture ceased its 

activity in late 2023 and the structure is now in the process of being formally dissolved.

149

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther information1.  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
1.3  Segment reporting 
Operating and reporting segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating 

Decision Maker (CODM). The Group’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 

performance, has been identified as the CODM.

The CODM regularly reviews the Group’s operating results in order to assess performance and to allocate resources. The CODM 

considers the business from a product perspective and, therefore, recognises one operating and reporting segment, being the sale 

of software and related services. The Group splits revenue by type of activity but reports operating results on a consolidated basis, 

as presented to the CODM, along with the required entity wide disclosures.

The Group discloses revenue split by type of activity, being Subscription, Software and Services.

a.   Subscription revenues include recurring revenues paid on a monthly or annual basis, including subscription licence revenues, 

maintenance and cloud hosting.

b.   Software revenues include revenues from the recognition of customised licence revenue, one-off licence fees and any 

development revenues. 

c.   Services revenues are revenues from any work done for customers including pre-implementation, implementation work, and 

ongoing services, but excludes any revenue from development work which is disclosed in Software.

See note 1.5 for details of our revenue recognition accounting policy and note 2 for the critical accounting judgements and estimates 

in relation to revenue recognition.

1.4  Foreign currency translation
Functional currency 

Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using their functional 

currency. The functional currency of the parent and each subsidiary is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 

the entity operates. See applicable exchange rates used in 2023 and 2022 below:

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended 31 December 2023 continuedGroup companies 

The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have 

a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

•  Assets and liabilities for each consolidated statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date 

of that consolidated statement of financial position;

•  Income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and statement of comprehensive income are translated at average 

exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction 

dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and

•  All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities are recognised in other 

comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold, the associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as 

part of the gain or loss on sale.

Foreign currency transactions 

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies using the exchange rates prevailing at the 

dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 

the reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss. See applicable 

exchange rates used by the Group above.

1.5  Revenue recognition
The Group derives revenue by type of activity being Subscription, Software and Services (as disclosed in note 1.3). 

i 

 Subscription revenue includes the periodic rights to use Alfa Systems, periodic maintenance, subscription (including cloud 

hosting) and one-off revenue relating to catch-up periodic maintenance; 

ii 

 Software revenue includes development revenue (part of the customised licence revenue), options over the right to use 

Alfa Systems, and one-off licence fees; and

iii   Services revenue includes software implementation services.

The Group provides the right to use, software development services, core implementation services and ongoing support of its 

product, Alfa Systems. The Group’s contractual arrangements contain multiple deliverables or services, such as the development 

or customisation of the software to the customer’s requirements, implementation services such as migration of data and testing, 

and certain project management services. 

Alfa assesses whether there are distinct performance obligations at the start of each contract and throughout the performance of 

the implementation, development and services projects and maintenance period. These performance obligations are laid out below.  

Any one contract may include a single performance obligation or a combination of those listed below:

1.5.1  Software implementation services 

Where implementation services are considered to be distinct, i.e. when relatively straightforward, do not require additional 

development services and could be performed by an external third party, the implementation services are accounted for as 

a separate performance obligation from any development services. 

When a customer is in the process of implementing the software, the transaction price is allocated to this based on the stand-alone 

selling prices (derived from standard day rates) and is recognised over time based on the effort incurred, limited to the amount 

to which Alfa has a right to payment. Over time recognition is considered appropriate as customers simultaneously receive and 

consume the benefits provided. For customers under the Group’s subscription-based contracts that are undergoing implementation, 

revenue for software implementation services is deemed to be distinct from any other performance obligation and is recognised 

based on a percentage-of-completion basis.

151

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther information1.  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
1.5  Revenue recognition continued
When the type of services provided are ongoing services, the transaction price is deemed to be the actual day rate, and revenue is 

recognised at a point in time as the service is provided.

1.5.2  Development services and licence services (the customised licence)

Another performance obligation is the granting of a right to use Alfa Systems, which includes the delivery of the related software 

licence and any development efforts which change the underlying code. 

During the initial phase of implementing the software, the total revenue attributable to this performance obligation is estimated at 

the outset of the relevant software implementation project and recognised as the effort is expended, on a percentage-of-completion 

basis, limited to the amount of revenue to which Alfa has the right to payment. See note 5.6 for the accounting policy for variable 

consideration. A percentage-of-completion basis has been used because customers obtain the ability to benefit from the product 

from the start of the implementation project; the development or customisation of the asset is tailored to the customer’s specific 

requirements; and the customer is entitled to the benefits of the efforts as at the date the efforts are delivered, so recognition over 

time is appropriate.

Revenue attributable to development services is valued using the residual value method as there are no stand-alone selling prices 

which are observable, as each project is customised. For customers under the Group’s subscription-based contracts that are 

undergoing implementation, revenue for development services is deemed to be distinct from any other performance obligation 

and is recognised based on a percentage-of-completion basis.

Once the customer is already using the software and the services provided are ongoing development, the transaction price is 

deemed to be the actual day rate and revenue is recognised at a point in time as the development service is provided. 

1.5.3  Option over the right to use Alfa Systems 

In the event that perpetual licence customers have to pay periodic maintenance fees in order to keep using Alfa Systems, a 

component of these future maintenance fees is attributable to the right to use the software. In these circumstances, the licence 

granted by Alfa is considered to renew in future periods. There may be a material right in respect of discounts in future periods. In 

order to ascribe a value to this option, management annualises the value of the customised licence performance obligation and 

compares it to the annual right to use software performance obligation post go live.

The value of this option is built up from the start of the implementation project in line with the percentage of completion of 

development revenue described in note 1.5.2 above. Following the completion of the implementation project, the value of this option 

is recognised evenly over the expected remaining customer life.

1.5.4  Periodic right to use Alfa Systems 

When a customer pays its maintenance fee annually, this performance obligation represents the proportion of this fee which relates 

to the periodic option to renew the right to use Alfa Systems. If there is the right of clawback of the annual right to use, such amounts 

are recognised throughout the annual period. If there is no right of clawback, then the annual right to use amount is recognised in full 

when there is a right of collection.

When a customer pays for its maintenance fee as part of a subscription contract (see note 1.5.6 below), it will not be treated as a 

separate performance obligation (and will instead be part of the subscription amount). 

1.5.5  Periodic maintenance amounts 

This represents the stand-alone selling price of the ongoing support or maintenance of Alfa Systems which is recognised throughout 

the period over which the services are delivered. 

152

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued1.5.6  Subscription amounts 

Certain of the Group’s implementation and service contracts include a subscription payment mechanism. This represents a monthly 

fee charged to the customer covering one or more of the following performance obligations: the provision of monthly hosting 

services; the monthly periodic right to use Alfa Systems; and the provision of monthly maintenance services (when this becomes 

applicable to the customer). The monthly payments are recognised as revenue in the period to which they relate. This reflects the 

underlying performance obligations of the Group and termination rights of the customer.

1.5.7  One-off revenue amounts

From time to time, the Group is entitled to receive one-off licence revenue from its customers as they increase the number of 

contracts on their version of Alfa Systems. Additionally, there are times when catch-up periodic maintenance amounts are entitled to 

be received by the Group, also as a result of the increased number of contracts. Generally, this revenue is recognised at the point in 

time it is invoiced, or becomes contractually payable, reflecting the fact that the Group has no remaining performance obligations 

to satisfy.

Capitalised sales incentive costs

The Group incentivises its sales force for securing sales. In line with IFRS 15, these costs are capitalised and are amortised in line with 

the percentage of completion of the software implementation project.

Costs to fulfil contracts

The Group has recognised an asset in relation to employee costs to fulfil its long-term development contracts (as disclosed in note 

21). These costs relate directly to the contracts, generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy performance obligations in the 

future and are expected to be recovered. This asset is presented within prepayments in the statement of financial position. These 

costs are amortised within cost of sales in line with the percentage of completion of the development project.

1.6  Operating expenses
Operating expenses include items such as personnel costs (including training and recruitment), cost of software not capitalised, 

research and development costs, and other infrastructure expenses. These items have been grouped into the following categories 

for disclosure purposes:

•  Cost of sales – This includes salaries and other direct costs associated with satisfying customer contracts (including hosting costs) 

and for developing software.

•  Sales, general and administrative expenses – This includes all the residual operating costs.

Income tax

1.7 
Taxation expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting period. Tax is recognised in profit and 

loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Current or deferred 

taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax 

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the 

countries where the Group and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions 

taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions 

where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 

Under the R&D Expenditure Credit (also referred to as the ‘RDEC’) scheme, the Group has received a tax credit based on qualifying 

R&D expenditure. This tax credit is recognised within pre-tax income, as ‘Other Income’.

Deferred tax 

Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 

and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not 

accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the 

time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 

153

1.7 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date 

Income tax continued

and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 

the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable 

right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes, assets and liabilities relate to 

income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an 

intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 

1.8  Leases
Alfa enters into lease contracts in respect of various properties and motor vehicles. These rental contracts are typically made for 
fixed periods of two to ten years, and sometimes have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and 

contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. In accordance with IFRS 16, leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset with 

a corresponding liability, at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by Alfa. These assets and liabilities are initially 

measured on a present value basis (as set out in more detail below), with each subsequent lease payment allocated between the 

liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of 

interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s 

useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Alfa assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and 

a corresponding lease liability, with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined 

as leases with a lease term of 12 months, or less) and leases of low-value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease 

payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic basis is more representative 

of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.

Lease liabilities 

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, 

discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental 

borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

•  Fixed lease payments (including in substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives; 

•  Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; 

•  The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; 

•  The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and 

•  Penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease. 

The lease liability is presented in separate lines, split between current and non-current liabilities, in the consolidated statement of 

financial position. It is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the 

effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

The Group re-measures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever:

•  The lease term has changed, or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease 

liability is re-measured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; 

•  The lease payments change due to changes in an index, or rate, or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual 
value. In these cases, the lease liability is re-measured by discounting the revised lease payments, using the initial discount rate 

(unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used); and 

154

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued•  A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is 

re-measured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. 

Right-of-use assets 

The right-of-use assets comprise:

•  The initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability;

•  Lease payments made at, or before, the commencement day;

•  Any initial direct costs; and 

•  Restoration cost.

The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (if applicable). 

They are depreciated from the commencement date of the lease and over the shorter period of the lease term and useful life of the 

underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset, or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects an expectation 

that the Group will exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying 

asset. Currently, the Group does not have any leases that include a purchase option, or transfer ownership of the underlying asset.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located, 

or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and 

measured under IAS 37. 

Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be 

extended (or not terminated). The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which 

affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee. During the current financial period, there have been no changes 

in such assessments. 

Variable rents that do not depend on an index, or rate, are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use 

asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments 

occurs and are included as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income.

Impairment of non-financial assets

1.9 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The carrying amount is allocated to the cash-generating unit (CGU) that is expected to 
benefit from investment and which represents the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management 

purposes. The carrying value of the CGU is then compared to the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. 

Any impairment attributed to the goodwill is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might 

not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 

amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of 

assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are 

largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other 

than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

1.10  Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand as well as short-term deposits with original maturities of three months 

or less.

155

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther information1.  Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
1.11  Financial assets
Recognition and de-recognition 

Financial assets are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provision of 

the instrument.

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial 

asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. 

Classification and initial measurement of financial assets 

Except for those trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component and are measured at the transaction price 

in accordance with IFRS 15, all financial assets are initially measured at fair value adjusted for transaction costs (where applicable). 

Financial assets, other than those designated and effective as hedging instruments, are classified into the following categories:

•  Amortised cost;

•  Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and

•  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

In the periods presented, the Group does not have any material financial assets categorised as FVTPL or FVOCI. The classification is 

determined by both:

•  The entity’s business model for managing the financial asset; and

•  The contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

All income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognised in profit or loss, where material, are presented within finance 

costs, finance income or other financial items, except for impairment of trade receivables which is presented within sales, general 

and administrative expenses.

Subsequent measurement of financial assets
Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if the assets meet the following conditions (and are not designated as FVTPL):

•  They are held within a business model whose objective is to hold the financial assets and collect their contractual cash flows; and

•  The contractual terms of the financial assets give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 

principal amount outstanding. 

After initial recognition, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Discounting is omitted where the 

effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group’s trade and most other receivables (notes 20 and 21) and cash and cash equivalents 

(note 22) fall into this category of financial instruments.

Impairment of financial assets

Under IFRS 9, the requirements are to use forward-looking information to recognise expected credit losses – the ‘expected credit loss 

(ECL) model’. The Group considers a broad range of information when assessing credit risk and measuring expected credit losses, 

including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the 

future cash flows of the instrument.

156

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued1.12  Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for licences sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. 

They are generally due for settlement within 30 days of the invoice date and are therefore all classified as current. Trade receivables 

are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision 

for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 

amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. 

The Group has applied the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance. 

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days overdue. The expected impairment loss 

is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income within sales, general and administrative 

expenses, and subsequent recoveries are credited to the same account previously used to recognise the impairment charge. During 

the current and prior period, the result of the above was immaterial and no impairment loss has been recognised.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above. 

The credit qualities of these receivables are periodically assessed by reference to external credit ratings (if available) or to historical 

information about their default rates. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

As the total carrying amount of the current portion of the trade and other receivables is due within the next 12 months after the 

reporting date, the impact of applying the effective interest method is not significant and, therefore, the carrying amount equals 

the contractual amount or the fair value initially recognised.

1.13  Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is 

directly attributable to the acquisition of the item. Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their 

cost over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Fixtures and fittings: 3-10 years

IT equipment: 2-5 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if necessary at each reporting date. An asset’s carrying amount 

is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable 

amount. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income as 

incurred. Any gains or losses on disposals are recognised within sales, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated 

statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income unless otherwise specified.

Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 

amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 

recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing 

impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.

1.14  Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill

Goodwill arose on the acquisition of subsidiaries in 2012 as part of a group reorganisation and represents the excess of the 

consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. 

157

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther information1.  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
1.14  Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
The Group assesses whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis in accordance with the accounting policy 

stated in note 1.9 above. There is one CGU, being the Group, as its geographical operations do not have separate or distinct cash 

inflows. The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections 

from financial budgets and forecasts. 

Budgeted cash flow projections are based on the expectation of signing new customers in the Group’s sales pipeline as well as 

ongoing projects with existing customers. Budgeted gross margin is based on historical evidence and the expectations of market 

development and efficiency leverage. Management believes that any reasonable change in any of the key assumptions on 

which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the reported carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the 

CGU. The discount rate used reflects the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC), as adjusted for region-specific 

risks and other factors as required by IFRS.

Intangible assets

Internally generated product development costs only qualify for capitalisation if the Group can demonstrate all of the following:

•  The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete the 

intangible asset and use or sell it;

•  Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset, including how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

•  The existence of a market or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset;

•  The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the 

intangible asset; and

•  Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during development.

Commercial viability of new products, modules or capabilities is generally not proven until the major high-risk development issues 

have been resolved through testing of the specific development. Development expenditure incurred on minor or major upgrades, or 

other changes in software functionality, does not satisfy the criteria, where it is considered that the product is not substantially new 

in its design or functional characteristics. Such expenditure is therefore recognised as an expense. See note 15 for disclosure of 

development costs which have met the criteria of IAS 38 for recognition. The Group continually assesses the eligibility of 

development costs for capitalisation on a project-by-project basis.

Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at historical cost. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly 

attributable to the acquisition of the item. 

The Group amortises intangible assets with a limited useful life, using the straight-line method over the following periods:

Computer software: licence period or 10 years as applicable 

Internally generated software: 3-5 years

Amortisation is presented within sales, general and administrative expenses.

Research and development costs which do not meet the criteria set out above are recognised as an expense when incurred. 

Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in subsequent periods. 

1.15  Trade and other payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services which have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 

suppliers. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effective 

interest rate method. As the total carrying amount is due within the next 12 months from the reporting date, the impact of applying 

the effective interest method is not significant and, therefore, the carrying amount equals the contractual amount or the fair value 

initially recognised. 

158

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended 31 December 2023 continuedThe Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables and lease liabilities. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair 

value, and, where applicable, adjusted for transaction costs unless the Group designated a financial liability at fair value through 

profit or loss. Subsequently, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. All interest-

related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument’s fair value that are reported in profit or loss are included within finance 

costs or finance income. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 

cancelled or expired.

Trade and other payables and lease liabilities are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they 

are presented as non-current liabilities.

1.16  Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely 

than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. 

When the effect of the discounting is material, provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be 

required to settle the obligation.

1.17  Employee benefits
The Group provides a range of benefits to employees, including paid holiday arrangements and defined contribution pension plans.

Short-term benefits 

Short-term benefits, including health cover and other similar non-monetary benefits, are recognised as an expense in the period in 

which the service is received.

Post-employment benefits 

The Group operates various defined contribution plans for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan where the 

Group pays fixed contributions into a separate independent entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 

contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to the employee’s service in the 

current and prior periods.

Employee share scheme expense

The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant 

and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. For 

those share schemes with market-related vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo model at the grant 

date. For share options issued with EPS (non-market) performance vesting conditions, the fair value of the underlying vehicle is equal 

to the grant date share price discounted by the expected dividend yield to reflect the lack of dividend accrual over the vesting period. 

For all other share awards, those with pure employment conditions attached, the fair value is determined by reference to the market 

value of the shares at the grant date or (where they have an exercise price) by using the Black Scholes model. For all share schemes 

with non-market vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the relevant charge. 

Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.

1.18  Equity
Ordinary shares

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. There are no restrictions on the distribution of capital and the repayment of capital. 

Cumulative translation reserve

Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 

in a separate reserve within equity. The cumulative amount would be reclassified to profit or loss if the entity was disposed of.

159

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther information1.  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
1.18  Equity continued
Own shares

Own shares represent the shares of the parent company Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC that are either held by the employee 

benefit trust, or acquired by the Group as part of its share buy-back programme (see note 28).

Own shares are recorded at cost and deducted from equity.

1.19  Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of Alfa by the weighted average number of 

ordinary shares outstanding during the year (excluding own shares held). 

Diluted earnings per share

Diluted earnings per share is calculated in line with the basic earnings per share calculation above except that the weighted average 

number of shares includes all potentially dilutive options granted by the reporting date as if those options had been exercised on the first 

day of the accounting period or the date of the grant, if later. The shares have no right to voting or to dividends while held in trust. 

2.  Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual 

results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are more 

likely to be materially adjusted in future periods due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be wrong. Detailed information 

about each of these estimates and judgements is included in other notes, together with information about the basis of calculation 

for each affected line item in the financial statements.

2.1  Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Revenue recognition – Assessing performance obligations 

The Group is required to make an assessment as to whether the implementation process, which includes customised licence and 

implementation revenue streams as well as any maintenance fees during this phase, forms one or a number of performance 

obligations. Since the residual value method is used for the customised licence revenue (as explained in note 1.5), the estimation 

of fair value of implementation revenue will impact the contract consideration assigned to the customised licence. 

In addition, the Group is also required to make an assessment as to whether each contract contains an expectation to deliver 

multiple separate instances of the customised licence which may form separate groups of distinct performance obligations. In doing 

the above, the Group assesses each software implementation contract as to whether the underlying software requires significant 

modification or customisation by the Group in order to meet the customer’s requirements before Alfa Systems can be utilised by the 

customer. Therefore, judgement is required in determining which efforts relate to the implementation process and which efforts 

could be determined to be development services which change or enhance the underlying code. In making this judgement, the Group 

assesses the contractual terms and the original project plan for the implementation but also uses historical evidence of what 

constitutes core implementation work.

Internally generated software development – Assessing whether a project meets criteria of IAS 38

The Group is required to make an assessment of each ongoing project in order to determine at what stage (if at all) a project 

meets the criteria outlined in the Group’s accounting policies. Such assessment may, in certain circumstances, require significant 

judgement. In making this judgement, the Group evaluates, amongst other factors, the stage at which technical feasibility has been 

achieved, management’s intention to complete and use or sell the product, the likelihood of success, the availability of technical and 

financial resources to complete the development phase and management’s ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable 

to the project. Research and product development expenditure incurred on minor or major upgrades, or other changes in software 

functionality, does not satisfy the criteria where it is considered that the product is not substantially new in its design or functional 

160

characteristics. Such expenditure is therefore recognised as an expense.

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued2.2  Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Revenue recognition – Estimates feeding through to the customised licence 

The customised licence and its associated material right are both impacted by the following estimates:

•  Assigning a stand-alone selling price for implementation services day rates: the Group assesses the value of the implementation 

services delivered by assessing the effective day rate for an implementation contract, taking into account all revenue streams from 

implementation contracts against day rates of similar projects in the same geographies; 

•  Estimating the appropriate life of customer relationship: the Group calculates the material right deferral of the customised licence 

based on the total customer relationship life. This is also the time over which the material right will be spread; and

•  Determining the split of maintenance amount between support efforts and right to use: the Group must estimate what percentage 

of the total maintenance fee relates to the customised licence. 

A change to the stand-alone selling price for implementation services to the effective day rate, or an increase in expected customer 

life by a year, or a 10% variance in the split of maintenance amount between support efforts and right to use, results in an impact on 

revenue for the year of up to an increase/decrease of £0.1m.

3.  Financial risk management
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note 

describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further 

quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.

The Group’s overall risk management policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 

adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group has used financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures in 

the past. Risk management is carried out by the finance function under policies approved by the Board. The finance function 

identifies, evaluates and mitigates financial risks when deemed necessary. 

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can 

provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and maintain an optimal capital structure.

3.1  Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from various currencies, primarily with respect 

to those described below. Revenue is predominantly denominated in pounds sterling and US dollars. Operating costs are influenced 

by the currencies of the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries are based, and pounds sterling and the US dollar are the currencies 

in which most operating costs are denominated.

The split by currency in relation to trade receivables is set out in note 20.

The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk in relation to revenue is set out in note 5.4.

The Group utilised forward contracts in both 2023 and 2022 to hedge against foreign currency exposure. The Group has one 

outstanding commercial foreign exchange contract at 31 December 2023 with a fair value of £0.2m (2022: none outstanding). No 

hedge accounting has been applied in the year. 

A 10% increase in the USD:GBP exchange rate in the year ended 31 December 2023 would have increased revenue and profit by 3% 

and 6% respectively (2022: 4% and 8% respectively). Management believes that 10% is a reasonable sensitivity given historical 

exchange rate movement.

3.2  Credit risk 
a. 

Credit risk related to transactions with financial institutions 

Credit risk with financial institutions is managed by the Group’s finance function in accordance with a Board-approved treasury 

policy. Management is not aware of any significant risks associated with financial institutions as a result of cash and cash equivalents 

deposits (including short-term investments) and financial derivative transactions. 

b. 

Credit risks related to customer trade receivables 

Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, change 

of strategy and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that a trade receivable could be impaired. Given the 

complexity, the size and the length of certain software implementation of related projects, a delay in the settlement of an open 

trade receivable does not necessarily constitute objective evidence that the trade receivable is irrecoverable.

The Group’s customer base predominantly consists of large financial institutions that are financially sound. The responsibility for 

customer credit risk management rests with management of the Group. Payment terms are set in accordance with practices in the 

different geographies and end-markets served, typically being 30 days from the date of the invoice. Trade receivables are actively 

monitored and managed. Collection risk is mitigated through prompt submission of invoices. Historically, there has been a de minimis 

level of customer default as a result of the long history of dealing with the Group’s customer base and an active credit monitoring 

function. Where applicable, credit limits may be established based on internal or external rating criteria, which take into account such 

factors as the financial condition of the customers, their credit history and the risk associated with their industry segment. 

162

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended 31 December 2023 continuedThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance 

for all trade receivables and accrued income. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and accrued income have 

been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The accrued income relates to unbilled work in 

progress and has substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts, other than 

where the Group has collected upfront payments in the form of licence fees at the start of a software implementation contract. 

The expected loss rates of trade receivables are based on the payment profiles of customer invoices over a period of 36 months 

before 31 December 2023 (2022: 31 December 2022), and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. 

The historical loss rates are then adjusted to reflect current or forward-looking information in relation to any macroeconomic factors 

affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The same approach is applied to both trade receivables and accrued 

income expected credit loss provisions.

The Group has not identified any current factors or forward-looking information which would be relevant to the historical loss rates. 

Therefore, on this basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 was immaterial for both trade receivables 

and accrued income.

See note 20 – Trade receivables for the ageing of trade receivables and significant customer credit risk exposure.

3.3  Liquidity risk
The Group’s principal objectives when managing capital are to ensure that funds are available to support its growth strategy and to 

safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents (note 22) and equity attributable to equity holders of 

the parent.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.

The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk through short and long-term forecasts and by seeking to align the maturity profiles 

of its financial assets with its financial liabilities. The Group’s policy is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet its liabilities 

expected to be settled in the short or near term, under both normal and stressed conditions.

The following table details the remaining contractual maturity of the Group’s financial liabilities. The amounts disclosed in the table 

are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

Where a customer purchases a perpetual software licence, this is generally invoiced upfront at the commencement of the 

implementation project. Customers generally require additional development efforts over the life of the implementation project 

in order to customise the underlying code within Alfa Systems. Together, these two elements form the Group’s customised licence 

performance obligation. The fair value of this performance obligation is determined using the residual method as set out in 

note 1.5.2 and this fair value is recognised as the development effort is expended, on a percentage-of-completion basis. 

As such, the deferred licence contract liability balance as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 represents any amounts 

received in advance for the customised licence performance obligation being satisfied (including any unrecognised software licence 

amounts that were received upfront). Additionally, where an option over the right to use Alfa Systems in the future exists, the value 

of this is also included within the deferred licence contract liability. The contract liability relating to the material right value is 

increased over the life of the implementation project in line with the percentage of completion of the development efforts and then 

released on a straight-line basis over the expected remaining customer life post completion of the implementation project.

The deferred licence contract liability balance will increase during the year as a result of:

•  Any new upfront software licence payments; 

•  Any write back in previously recognised revenue as a result of project extensions or re-plans; 

•  Decreasing percentage of completion of development efforts; and 

•  Any additional material right balances that are added during the year.

165

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther information5.  Revenue from contracts with customers continued
5.5  Liabilities from contracts with customers continued
The deferred licence contract liability balance will decrease during the year as a result of:

•  Increasing percentage of completion of development efforts; and

•  Any release of material right balances following the completion of the implementation project. 

Contract liabilities – deferred maintenance

The majority of the Group’s customers are invoiced annually in advance for the maintenance and support service provided by the 

Group. As such, the deferred maintenance contract liability balance will increase as a result of billing and invoices becoming due, 

and will decrease as the Group satisfies its associated performance obligations. The deferred maintenance contract liability balance 

as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 therefore represents the Group’s unsatisfied period maintenance performance 

obligation for which the revenue has been invoiced in advance.

5.6  Unsatisfied performance obligations
During 2020, the Group entered into a new one-off five-year contract with a customer to renew its software licence and maintenance 

agreements. The total amount of the contract price from this non-cancellable contract that relates to the performance obligations 

that are unsatisfied at 31 December 2023 is £4.0m (2022: £6.2m). We expect to recognise £2.2m in the next financial year and then 

the remaining £1.8m in the final financial year of the contract, being 2025.

In addition, the Group has unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations at 31 December 2023 that relate to the licence 

customisation for those customers that have ongoing implementation projects. This performance obligation includes the delivery 

of the related software licence and any development efforts which will change the underlying code. Linked to certain of these 

ongoing and future projects, and also to certain implementation projects completed during 2023, the Group also has unsatisfied or 

partially satisfied performance obligations at 31 December 2023 that relate to the option over the right to use Alfa Systems, and in 

particular any material right in respect of discounts to be received by customers in future periods. 

The above includes certain amounts recognised as contract liabilities. The transaction price allocated to these unsatisfied or partially 

satisfied performance obligations as at 31 December 2023 is £9.4m (2022: £11.0m). This amount is expected to be recognised over 

the remaining life of the implementation projects, in respect of the licence and development efforts, and over the expected customer 

life (following the completion of the implementation project) in respect of the option over the right to use Alfa Systems. Of the £9.4m, 

it is expected that £2.0m will be recognised in 2024, with the remainder being recognised in subsequent years. 

These unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations are based on management’s best judgement and may be impacted 

in the future by a number of factors including:

•  Any possible contract modifications;

•  Currency fluctuations; 

•  External market factors; and

•  Changes to the overall forecast project plan including the overall life of the implementation project and any required 

development efforts.

The Group applies the practical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about the unsatisfied 

performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. This includes those performance obligations 

linked to ongoing services for all project types (i.e. subscription, software and services).

The Group also applies the practical expedient in paragraph B16 of IFRS 15 and does not disclose the amount of the transaction 

price allocated to the unsatisfied contract performance obligations where consideration will be received directly corresponding to 

the value of the performance obligation in the future and this consideration aligns to the value received to date for the corresponding 
performance obligation. This includes those performance obligations linked to our software implementation services.

166

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended 31 December 2023 continuedThe disclosures above for unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations are not relevant to our subscription performance 

obligations as these are typically satisfied on a monthly basis in line with the termination rights of the customers (see note 1.5.6).

The Group has variable consideration in the form of contract banding for its licence and maintenance volumes. It is included it in the 

transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty 

associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

The effective tax rate for the year is lower (2022: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK. The effective tax rate 

for the year ended 31 December 2023 was 20.6% (2022: 15.2%). The effective tax rate for the year is impacted by favourable 

adjustments in respect to prior years totalling £1.2m (2022: £1.3m), due predominately to the benefit of the R&D claim for 2022 

(2022: due to the benefit of the R&D claim for 2021 of £0.9m and favourable adjustments in respect to prior year provisions of £0.4m). 

As the Group is now required to claim relief for R&D under the UK RDEC regime, no tax rate benefit will be expected in the future (the 

tax benefit is instead reflected in lower cash tax payable) and, as a consequence, the effective tax rate will trend towards the UK 

statutory tax rate. 

The overall tax charge for the year is reconciled as follows:

The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections from 

financial budgets and forecasts for a five-year period using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.4% (2022: 12.2%) which is based on the CGU’s 

weighted average cost of capital. Cash flows beyond these periods have been extrapolated using a steady 2.7% (2022: 2.5%) average 

growth rate which is reflective of management’s best estimate at the time. Management believes that any reasonable change in any 

of the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the reported carrying amount to exceed the 

recoverable amount of the CGU.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on 

the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of these temporary differences and 

it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Unremitted earnings totalled £5.5m at 31 December 2023 

(2022: £4.1m).

At the reporting date, the provision for deferred tax comprised net deferred tax assets of £0.4m relating to overseas group 

companies, and net deferred tax (liabilities) in respect to the UK of £(0.1m). In the prior year, the provision for deferred tax comprised 

net deferred tax assets of £0.4m relating to overseas group companies, and net deferred tax assets in respect to the UK of £1.2m. 

19.  Interests in joint venture 
At the beginning of May 2020, the Group formed Alfa iQ, a joint venture established to greatly enhance Alfa’s ability to develop 

artificial intelligence solutions for the auto and equipment finance industry. The joint venture was set up 51:49 between Alfa and 

Bitfount, a company founded by Blaise Thomson. The financial and operating activities of the Group’s joint venture are jointly 

controlled by the participating shareholders. The participating shareholders have rights to the net assets of the joint venture through 

their equity shareholdings. As explained on page 10, the activity in Alfa iQ is being brought fully into the Group. As a result, the Alfa iQ 

joint venture ceased its activity in late 2023 and the structure is now in the process of being formally dissolved. The investment in 

joint venture and the loan have therefore been written off as at 31 December 2023. The interest in the joint venture consists of part 

investment and part loan to the joint venture, accounted for as set out in note 1.2.

Accrued income represents fees earned but not yet invoiced at the reporting date which have no right of offset with contract 

liabilities – deferred licence amounts. Faster invoicing at December 2023 reduced the accrued income balance, which reduced by 

£1.9m compared with December 2022.

Prepayments include £1.3m (2022: £1.7m) of deferred costs in relation to costs to fulfil contracts – see note 1.5. During the year, 

£0.2m (2022: £0.3m) relating to costs to fulfil contracts has been recognised within cost of sales.

Corporate tax recoverable at the reporting date of £1.9m (2022: £0.2m) represents UK tax, pending the submission of R&D related 

claims for 2022 and 2023.

29.1  LTIPs
The June 2020 LTIP awards vested during the year. The exercise of these awards had a net impact of £1.7m on own shares and £3.4m 

on retained earnings.

The 2021 April LTIP awards and the 2022 April LTIP awards (service and performance conditions) are conditional on performance 

conditions, 50% based on EPS performance (non-market condition) and 50% on TSR (market condition) as well as a three-year 

employment fulfilment. The fair value of these awards has been determined using the Monte Carlo model.

The 2021 November LTIP awards, the 2022 April LTIP awards and the 2022 September LTIP awards (service conditions) are conditional 

on employment only. The fair value of these awards is equal to the closing share price on the date of grant, discounted by the 

expected 12-month dividend yield to reflect the lack of dividend accrual over the vesting period. The expected price volatility is based 

on the historical volatility (based on the remaining life of the scheme), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to 

publicly available information.

The 2023 April LTIP awards (service and performance conditions plan) are granted conditional on performance conditions, 50% 

based on EPS performance (non-market condition) and 50% on TSR (market condition) as well as a three year employment fulfilment. 

For those awards with market-related vesting conditions, the fair value has been determined using the Black Scholes model at the 

grant date. For awards issued with EPS (non-market) performance vesting conditions, the fair value of the underlying option is equal 

to the grant date share price. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the awards granted in the year ended 31 

December 2023 based on information at the date of grant:

In April 2023, the Group awarded to certain employees an LTIP conditional on employment only. The fair value of these awards on the 

date of grant is 124.1p, discounted by the expected 12-month dividend yield to reflect the lack of dividend accrual over the vesting 

period (three years).

All of these Company schemes, as well as any non-cyclical awards, are equity-settled by award of ordinary shares.

The Group has in place an Employee ShareSave Scheme – the Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme in the UK and Employee Stock 

Purchase Plan (ESPP) scheme in the USA. Under these schemes, eligible employees can save up to a set limit each month. At the end 

of the savings period (three years for SAYE and two years for ESPP), employees can choose whether or not they wish to buy the 

shares at the option price or take back their savings as cash. The option price is the share price at the start of the plan with a 20% 

discount for the UK scheme and 15% discount for the US scheme. The fair value of these awards has been determined using the Black 

Scholes model at the grant date.

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2023Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued32.3 Transactions with related parties
Full details of the Directors’ compensation and interests are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 115. See note 8 

for further detail on remuneration of key management (including Directors). 

Dividends to the amount of £11.8m were paid to the ultimate parent (2022: £15.0m). 

Dividends of 1.5 pence, 1.2 pence and 4.0 pence per share were paid to all shareholders in 2023 (2022: 3.0 pence, 1.1 pence and 

3.5 pence per share). Directors and other key management received dividends based on their beneficial interest in the shares of 

the Company. Directors’ beneficial interests in the shares of the Company are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on page 115.

In 2020, the Group invested £0.4m in Alfa iQ consisting of: a capital contribution of £0.3m; and an interest-free loan fair valued at 

£0.1m. At 31 December 2023 the investment is carried at £nil (2022: £0.1m) and the loan is carried at £nil (2022: £0.1m). This is 

because the activity in the Alfa iQ joint venture ceased in late 2023 and the structure is in the process of being formally dissolved. In 

2023 Alfa Financial Software Limited paid expenses of £0.1m (2022: £0.1m) on behalf of Alfa iQ Limited (relating to computer costs 

and payroll) and these were fully recharged back to Alfa iQ Limited at no mark up.

On 29 July 2022, the Group reached an agreement for the assignment of its lease to the 9th floor of Moor Place, 1 Fore Street Avenue, 

London (including a car parking space) to the ultimate parent. There is no consideration for the transaction, with the ultimate parent 

taking on all the rights and liabilities for the 9th floor from Alfa. The assignment of the lease resulted in the de-recognition of the right 

of use asset and lease liability, which resulted in a one-off gain of £0.6m which was fully recognised in 2022.

In 2022, the Company had rental income of £0.4m from a short-term rental agreement with the ultimate parent for rental of the 9th 

Floor of Moor Place. There was no such income in 2023 due to the assignment of the lease to the 9th floor of Moor Place, 1 Fore Street 

Avenue, London to the ultimate parent in July 2022. In 2022 the Company also received rental income of £3,718 relating to its prior 

arrangement with the ultimate parent for the rental of a meeting room on the 9th Floor of Moor Place. There was no such income in 

2023 due to the assignment mentioned above. 

In 2023, the Company paid property expenses of £0.04m (2022: £nil) on behalf of the ultimate parent and these were fully recharged 

back to the ultimate parent at no mark up. 

In 2023, the Company sold two debentures to the ultimate parent for £0.2m (2022: nil). The transaction was at arm’s length. 

The balances outstanding from the ultimate parent at 31 December 2023 and 2022 were £nil and £nil respectively. There were no 

other outstanding receivable balances from related parties at the end of the reporting period.

33.  Offsetting assets and liabilities
Assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position where Alfa 

currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to realise the asset and settle 

the liability simultaneously. 

The following table presents the recognised assets and liabilities that are offset as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 

in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Strategic reportCorporate governanceFinancial statementsOther informationNotes to the Company financial statements  
for the year ended 31 December 2023

1.  Summary of significant accounting policies
Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC is a public company limited by shares and is incorporated and domiciled in England. These 

financial statements are the separate financial statements for the Company. 

The registered office is Moor Place, 1 Fore Street Avenue, London, EC2Y 9DT, United Kingdom. The registered no. of Alfa is 10713517.

The principal activity of the Company is as a holding company. 

1.1  Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The financial statements of Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC have been prepared in compliance with Financial Reporting 

Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) and the 

Companies Act 2006. 

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in note 1 to the consolidated 

financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention. The Directors have 

used the going concern principle on the basis that the current profitable financial projections of the Company and its subsidiaries 

indicate they will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. As described in note 1.1 to the consolidated financial statements, 

this assessment includes downside stress testing in line with FRC guidance. 

The Company financial statements have been prepared in pounds sterling which is the functional and presentational currency of the 

Company and have been presented to the nearest £0.1m unless otherwise stated. 

As permitted by FRS 102, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation 

to financial instruments, presentation of a cash flow statement, share-based payments, the aggregate remuneration of key 

management personnel and related party transactions with other wholly-owned members of the Group.

This company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 102. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the 

Group accounts of Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC.

The Company exercises control over the employee benefit trust because it is exposed to, and has a right to, variable returns from this 

trust and is able to use its power over the trust to affect those returns. Therefore, the trust is consolidated by the Company. 

Investments in subsidiaries

1.2 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity when the Company is exposed to, 

or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 

over the entity. 

Unless otherwise stated, subsidiaries have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares, and the proportion of ownership 

interests held equals the voting rights held by the Company. The country of incorporation or registration is also each subsidiary’s 

principal place of business.

Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, including those costs associated with the acquisitions, less provision for 

any impairment in value. Where events or changes in circumstances, including an adverse movement in the share price, indicate that 

the carrying amount of an investment may not be recoverable, an impairment review is performed. An impairment write-down is 

recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use.

Any subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the dates of change of control. Where 

control of a subsidiary is lost, it is recognised in the profit or loss.

186

Amounts due to subsidiaries are unsecured, interest-free and repayable on demand. The carrying amounts of such payables are 

considered to be the same as their fair values due to their short-term nature.

Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 20231.3  Financial assets 
Basic financial assets, including trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances and other receivables, are initially recognised 

at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction. 

At the end of each reporting period, financial assets measured at amortised cost are assessed for objective evidence of impairment. 

If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated 

cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. 

1.4  Financial liabilities 
Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other payables and trading balances and loans from subsidiaries, are initially recognised 

at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the 

present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, 

and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.

Other payables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. As the total carrying amount is due 

within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date, the impact of applying the effective interest method is not significant and, 

therefore, the carrying amount equals to the contractual amount or the fair value initially recognised. 

Payables are classified as current liabilities if receipt or payment is due within one year or less.

1.5  Equity
Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. There are no restrictions on the distribution of capital and the repayment of capital. 

Own shares
Own shares represent the shares of Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC that are either held by the employee benefit trust, or 

acquired by the Group as part of its share buy-back programme (see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements). Own shares 

are recorded at cost and deducted from equity.

1.6  Employee share schemes
Grants made to subsidiary employees will not result in a charge recognised in the income statement, any charges for share-based 

payments are recognised as an increase in the cost of investment in subsidiaries (as a capital contribution). For full details of the 

Group’s share-based payments, refer to note 29 to the consolidated financial statements. 

1.7  Dividends
Dividends are recognised through equity when approved by Alfa’s shareholders or on payment, whichever is earlier.

2.  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 

of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 

seldom equal the related actual results. 

The inputs applied in the impairment review for the value-in-use calculation for the investments in subsidiaries are considered to be 

a key source of estimation uncertainty. Refer to note 2 for more details. 

There were no other critical accounting judgements that would have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the parent 

company financial statements or key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that would have a significant risk of 

causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

187

for the year ended 31 December 2023 continued

3.  Financial risk management
The Company’s exposure to financial risks is managed as part of the Group’s financial risk management. Full details about the 

Group’s exposure to financial risks and how these risks could affect the Group’s future financial performance are given in note 3 

to the consolidated financial statements.

The carrying amount of the investment is £429.8m at 31 December 2023 (2022: £428.7m). The share price of the Company as at 31 
December 2023 was lower than the average for the year. Therefore, in line with Note 1.2, a detailed impairment review was carried 

out which showed that no impairment of the investment was required. The recoverable amount of the investment was determined 

based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections of the Company and its subsidiaries from financial budgets and 

forecasts for a five-year period using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.4% (2022: 12.2%). Cash flows beyond these periods have been 

extrapolated using a steady 2.7% (2022: 2.5%) average growth rate which is reflective of management’s best estimate at the time. As 

the recoverable amount is in excess of the carrying amount of the investment, no impairment charge has been recognised during the 

current financial year. The impairment review is sensitive to assumptions made around the revenue growth rate – if the revenue 

growth rate assumed in each of the years in the period from 2025 to 2028 was reduced by 2.0% then the headroom would be 

reduced to £16.6m. We note that the share price has increased since 31 December 2023.

5.  Other receivables
At 31 December 2023, other receivables relate to prepayments of £0.4m (2022: £0.6m) and VAT receivables of £0.3m (2022: £0.0m).

Other payables relate to trade creditors of £0.1m (2022: £0.1m) and salary costs of £0.5m (2022: £0.5m). 

The long-term provision relates to the employer national insurance liability of £0.2m for the 2023, 2022 and 2021 share schemes 

(2022: £0.3m).

The own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in Alfa Financial Software Holdings PLC purchased in the market and held by 

the Company’s employee benefit trust and by the Group as a result of its share buy-back programme (see note 1.2 of the 

consolidated financial statements). 

The number of own shares held by the employee benefit trust at 31 December 2023 was 721,036 (2022: 2,163,952). The number 

of own shares held at 31 December 2023 by the Group as a result of its share buy-back programme was 4,775,119 (2022: 2,832,073).

As at 31 December 2023, the Group held 1.84% (2022: 1.67%) of its own called-up share capital.

11.  Employee share schemes
Under the rules of the Company’s LTIP plans, in November 2019, June 2020, April 2021, November 2021, April 2022, September 2022 

and April 2023, selected employees of the Company’s subsidiary were granted awards in the form of nil cost options over ordinary 

shares in Alfa. 

In April 2023, employees of the Company’s subsidiary that met the set criteria were invited to join a ShareSave Scheme – the SAYE 

scheme for the UK employees and the ESPP scheme for the US employees. Under these schemes, eligible employees can save up to a 

set limit each month and, at the end of the vesting period, can use these savings to buy ordinary shares in Alfa (at a discount) or take 

these back as cash. Employees of the Company’s subsidiary were invited to join similar schemes in November 2021, April 2022 and 

May 2022.

Refer to note 29 of the consolidated financial statements for more detail on these schemes. The cost of the share-based 

remuneration is passed to the relevant subsidiary. 

12.  Dividends
A 2022 ordinary dividend of 1.2 pence per share was paid on 26 June 2023 amounting to £3.5m (2022: £3.3m at 1.1p per share).

A 2023 special dividend of 1.5 pence per share was paid on 9 May 2023 amounting to £4.4m (2022: £8.9m at 3.0p per share).

A 2023 special dividend of 4.0 pence per share was paid on 6 October 2023 amounting to £11.8m (2022: £10.3m at 3.5p per share).

Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 1 May 2024, a 2023 final dividend of 1.3 pence per share will be paid on 27 June 

2024 to holders on the register on 31 May 2024. The ordinary shares will be quoted ex-dividend on 30 May 2024. In addition, the

3 May 2024 and a payment date of 30 May 2024.
