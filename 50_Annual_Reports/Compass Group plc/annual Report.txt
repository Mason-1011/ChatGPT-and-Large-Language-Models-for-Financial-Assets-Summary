A global leader in food services

We are focused on food and targeted support services 
in around 35 countries.

While our core offer is the provision of outsourced food services 
across the world in certain sectors, we also supply targeted 
support services, such as hospital cleaning.

New business growth is currently benefiting from an increase 
in first-time outsourcing due to additional operational 
complexities and inflationary pressures.

We provide food and support services  
across five market sectors

Highlights of the year 

We get close to clients and consumers by sectorising and sub-
sectorising our businesses, allowing us to deliver bespoke, 
innovative and cost effective solutions to meet their unique needs 
and create maximum mutual value. 

2023 was another year of significant progress for Compass. 
As well as delivering strong financial results, the Group 
continued to develop its digital and sustainability propositions, 
with a particular focus on food waste.

Business & Industry

Sustainability Report 

We utilise our scale, experience and digital capabilities to offer our 
clients attractive cost benefits, tailored menus and a wide range 
of innovative dining solutions that can add flexibility to their 
operating models.

In January, Compass published its Sustainability Report entitled 
‘Our Planet Promise’. The report outlined how the Group is 
tackling climate change, fighting food waste and ensuring food is 
sourced responsibly, whilst operating with the highest levels of 
integrity and strong governance.

Healthcare & Senior Living

We work directly with healthcare providers to prepare food that 
improves patient and senior living experiences – from restaurant-style 
cafés to in-room patient dining and specialist feeding.

Education

We strive to provide healthy, balanced meals right through the 
learning journey, from nursery to higher education. Our catering 
solutions come in multiple formats, from traditional onsite dining to 
vending and delivery or takeaway options.

Sports & Leisure

We have vast catering experience within this market, providing food, 
beverages and hospitality across large stadiums, conference venues, 
museums and galleries. 

Defence, Offshore & Remote

We are a leader in providing food and support services to many major 
oil, gas, mining and construction companies. Our clients rely on us to 
provide uninterrupted support, however challenging the 
operating conditions.

The Compass Group Foundation 

The Compass Group Foundation was launched in January with a 
mission to improve people’s lives through the advancement of 
education and training, empowering them to play a key role in the 
future of food for their communities. 

By providing grants to non-profit organisations in countries where 
Compass operates, it aims to create inclusive job opportunities, 
empower local suppliers, and to provide urgent support in the 
case of global emergencies.

Strong first-half results and share buyback

In May, the Group published strong first-half results, raising its 
full-year guidance and announcing a further share buyback of up 
to £750 million. Net new business continued to be excellent, and 
significantly higher than the historical rate. There was a step 
change in our performance in Europe, as the region benefited 
from growth initiatives and favourable outsourcing conditions.

Sustainability Deep Dive

Compass presented a virtual deep dive on its sustainability 
proposition in September, highlighting the progress we have 
made with clients, consumers, employees and suppliers in 
finding collective solutions to meet our commitment to climate 
net zero by 2050. 

As well as being better for the planet, our sustainability focus is 
also contributing tangible commercial benefits, helping the 
Group to win new business.

Another excellent year for Compass 

In November, the Group announced its full-year results. 2023 
was another excellent year for Compass as it continued to benefit 
from broad-based growth, with revenue and margin improving 
across all its regions.

New business signings increased to a record £2.7 billion and the 
Group’s client retention rate continued to improve to 96.5%.

Driving performance through MAP

We use our Management and Performance (MAP) framework to drive performance across 
the business. It is a simple framework embedded in our culture, which ensures all employees 
are focused on meeting the following performance drivers:

Organic growth

Client sales 
and marketing

MAP 1 is about winning new business and retaining our existing 
clients. We invest in sales and retention and are increasingly 
sectorising and sub-sectorising the business around the world to 
allow us to get closer to our clients.

Consumer sales 
and marketing 

Managing cost

Cost of food

In-unit costs

Above-unit 
overheads

Like-for-like revenue consists of both volume and price. We are 
focused on attracting and satisfying our client base with strong 
consumer propositions.

Food makes up around one-third of our costs. In addition to 
the benefits of our scale in food procurement, we are able to 
manage food costs through careful menu planning and by 
rationalising the number of products we buy and the suppliers 
we buy them from.

In-unit costs are predominantly made up of labour. We focus 
on getting the right people in the right place at the right time. 
By using labour scheduling techniques and improving 
productivity, we are able to deliver the optimum level of 
service in the most efficient way.

We have a simple organisational model with few layers of 
management and little bureaucracy, which enables us to keep 
overheads low whilst we continue to grow revenue.

Strategic report

Strategic framework and business model continued

Enabled by our  
competitive advantages

Food is our focus and our core competence. 
We take a pragmatic and targeted approach 
to support services on a country and sector 
specific basis. We create value through 
organic growth, improving margins and 
targeted investment.

People and culture

Our people are at the heart of our business. 
Energetic, ambitious and entrepreneurial, 
they deliver amazing food and hospitality to 
millions of consumers worldwide.

Our sectors and portfolio of brands

Our sectorised approach is a key 
differentiator. Our businesses create 
bespoke solutions using extensive 
knowledge of their clients’ requirements.

Culinary and digital innovation

We strive to provide clients and consumers 
with greater choice, award-winning 
innovation and market-leading 
contemporary food offers. 

Procurement

Our scale enables our businesses to pass 
on purchasing benefits to clients and 
consumers by offering better quality 
products at more attractive prices. 
Spending with local and diverse suppliers 
and social enterprises enables greater 
reinvestment into social causes.

Decentralised structure

The Group operates on a decentralised 
basis, enabling an entrepreneurial 
approach by local management teams. 
This is supported by our MAP framework, 
which standardises business processes 
and increases efficiency.

Financial strength

A strong financial foundation with a low level 
of leverage means we can invest in growth, 
enabling our businesses to innovate their 
offer, and evolve our operating model. 
Our financial strength also attracts new 
clients seeking stability and long-term 
outsourcing solutions.

Creating value for all stakeholders

Clear capital allocation

Compass is a strong cash-generating business with a clear 
capital allocation model. We invest both organically and 
through acquisitions to drive growth. Our policy is to pay 
around 50% of underlying earnings through an ordinary 
dividend, with further additional shareholder returns 
when appropriate.

We do this whilst maintaining a resilient balance sheet, 
targeting net debt to EBITDA in the range of 1x-1.5x. 
Consistent with this framework is the return of excess 
capital to shareholders through share buybacks.

Strategic report

Chair’s letter

Another year of  
strong progress

Ian Meakins
Chair of the Board

Dear Shareholder

I am pleased to report that Compass has delivered yet another year of 
strong progress, both in terms of revenue growth and margin improvement.

The outsourcing market remains buoyant, driven by macroeconomic 
pressures, such as heightened inflation, and increasing operational 
complexity as consumers demand a more sophisticated food service 
offering, with digital and sustainability being the key drivers of growth.

People

Our people are at the heart of who we are and what we do. Our aim is 
to provide a culture in which our people thrive and feel valued for who 
they are and what they bring to Compass. They drive the business 
forward and make Compass a great place to work. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank all our people for their hard work, dedication, 
and commitment to the business.

Financial results 

The Group delivered excellent organic revenue growth of 18.8%1 and 
underlying operating margin increased by 60bps compared with the 
prior year to 6.8%1. This resulted in underlying operating profit 
increasing by 29.6%1 on a constant-currency basis to £2,122 million1. 
On a statutory basis, revenue increased by 21.6% to £31,028 million 
and operating profit was up 26.1% to £1,891 million. 

Shareholder returns

The Board recognises the importance of shareholder returns and 
has been rewarding investors through dividends and share buybacks. 
Our policy is to pay out around 50% of underlying earnings through 
an interim and final dividend. In line with this policy, the Board has 
declared a final dividend of 28.1 pence per share, which, when 
added to the interim dividend, provides a total dividend for the year 
of 43.1 pence. We also provided additional capital returns through 
the year in the form of share buybacks.

Strategy 

Our strategy is to focus on food, with targeted support services. The 
addressable food services market is estimated to be worth at least 
$300 billion, with a significant structural growth opportunity from 
first-time outsourcing, as around half of the market is still self-operated. 

We have a strategic focus on People, Performance and Purpose. 
These pillars underpin all that we do in our ambition to deliver value to 
all our stakeholders.

Sustainability 

Our Planet Promise is the Group’s global commitment to a sustainable 
future for all. It encompasses our values as an ethical, sustainable, 
and inclusive business, together with our ambition to positively 
impact the world. As well as being the right thing to do, this mission is

Group’s APMs are defined in note 34 (non-GAAP measures) and reconciled 
to GAAP measures in notes 2 (segmental analysis) and 34 to the consolidated 
financial statements.

also key to our growth aspirations as sustainability is also a priority 
for many of our clients.

Governance and Board changes

As your Chair, one of my key responsibilities is to ensure good 
governance (see pages 56 to 126), and I continue to be well 
supported by my fellow Board members. 

As previously announced, after a career of nearly 40 years at 
Compass, Gary Green will retire as Group Chief Operating Officer, 
North America and as a director of Compass Group PLC on 
30 November 2023. Gary will be succeeded by Palmer Brown, 
Group Chief Financial Officer, who joined Compass 22 years ago and 
has spent most of his working career in North America in a variety of 
senior finance, strategy, and legal roles. In turn, Palmer will be 
succeeded by Petros Parras, Regional Finance Director for Europe 
and the Middle East, who joined the business in January 2020. 

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Gary for his enormous 
contribution to Compass and offer him our best wishes for a very happy 
retirement. I would also like to extend the Board’s congratulations to 
Palmer and Petros on their appointments to their new roles.

Carol Arrowsmith will retire from the Board at the conclusion of the 2024 
AGM having served more than nine years on the Board. On behalf of 
the Board, I would like to thank Carol for her considerable contribution 
as a non-executive director and for her leadership and stewardship of 
the Remuneration Committee. I would also like to offer Carol our best 
wishes for the future. More details of all of these changes can be found 
in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 93 to 96.

Summary 

The Group continued to perform strongly in 2023 both in terms of growth 
and margin. We are successfully capitalising on the significant structural 
growth opportunities, particularly in first-time outsourcing, as we 
leverage our scale and expertise to achieve strong new business wins. 

Compass is a fantastic business with a clear strategy and significant 
growth potential. We look forward to continuing our journey and 
generating further sustainable long-term value for all our stakeholders.

Supporting 
sustainable growth

Outsourcing is growing

The addressable global food services market is worth at least  
$300 billion, of which Compass has less than 15% market share. 
This provides us a significant runway for growth, as nearly  
three-quarters of the market is still self-operated or in the  
hands of regional players.

In addition, there are further growth opportunities for 
Compass in vending, selected areas of food delivery, 
and targeted support services.

The drivers for outsourcing are also growing, due to increased 
regulation, operational complexity and inflationary pressures.

Recent trends

How we are responding

Inflation remains heightened, 
particularly in Europe, increasing 
first-time outsourcing opportunities as 
self-operators seek cost efficiencies.

Compass mitigates the impact of inflation using operational tools 
such as menu management, utilising our scale in food procurement, 
and digital innovation.

In addition to mitigating cost pressures, our businesses work 
closely with clients to price appropriately. 

More onerous health and safety 
regulation, such as allergen labelling, 
which larger players such as Compass 
are better placed to deal with.

Compass has long recognised the importance of accurate 
allergen information, increasingly using technology to provide  
up-to-date ingredient and allergen information for all dishes 
prepared and served.

Increased demand for convenience, 
for example through the use of 
pre-order and pre-payment methods.

We have been investing in digital for a decade now and have strong 
in-house capability that allows our businesses to create a bespoke 
digital offer for their clients.

Digital is also enabling our businesses to increase penetration and 
average transaction values as well as reducing food costs and 
increasing labour efficiencies.

Sustainability

Clients require bespoke solutions that 
take account of their specific 
sustainability commitments.

We pride ourselves on being an ethical and responsible Group, 
as demonstrated by our ambitious global climate net zero 
commitment. This is supported by our countries setting their 
own ambitious climate commitments. 

Consumer experience

Improving the variety of menus and 
quality of food service propositions.

Our focus on sustainability has been key to winning new business 
and retaining clients, and we expect this trend to continue.

We are elevating the role of the chef, for example through our 
Global Culinary Forum which brings together chefs representing 
all our regions. 

By creating a more inclusive culture our businesses can attract and 
develop more diverse talent as well as introduce more authentic 
food experiences to their consumers.

Increasing the involvement of front line teams better motivates 
our people and also drives better commercial outcomes.

Chief Executive’s review

Confident  
for the future

Dominic Blakemore
Group Chief Executive Officer

2023 was a strong year for Compass. North America continued its 
long track record of excellent growth whilst Europe delivered a second 
year of net new growth in the 4-5% range. During the year, we 
continued to successfully capitalise on the dynamic outsourcing 
trends, resulting in another record year of new business wins and 
continued strong client retention.

We have a strong, balanced, and sustainable growth model across the 
Group. Our size, strength and scale enable us to continue investing in 
our operating model, further enhancing our competitive advantages. 
We have exited nine tail countries to focus on markets with the 
greatest growth opportunities and our strong cash generation 
continues to fuel investment in our business through capex and 
attractive M&A. The business is in great shape operationally and 
financially and well positioned for a more focused growth phase. 

Group performance

The Group continues to perform strongly both in terms of organic 
revenue growth, which was 18.8%1, and underlying operating margin, 
which improved by 60bps to 6.8%1. As a result, underlying operating 
profit grew by 29.6%1 on a constant-currency basis to £2,122 million1 
(2022: £1,637 million). Statutory revenue increased by 21.6% 
reflecting the strong trading performance and favourable exchange 
translation. Statutory operating profit, including charges relating to 
business acquisitions and reshaping our portfolio which are excluded 
from underlying operating profit, increased by 26.1% to £1,891 million.

Capital expenditure was 2.9%1 of underlying revenue and net M&A 
expenditure was £304 million, which was largely spent on several 
bolt-on acquisitions, mainly in the US and UK. Subsequent to the 
year-end, the Group agreed to acquire Hofmann Menü-Manufaktur 
GmbH, a German producer of high-quality cook and freeze meals, and 
exited its small operations in Argentina and Angola. As a result of this 
and other disposals, including five countries in Central and Eastern 
Europe, Compass has further reduced its countries of operation to 
c.35 as it focuses on significant opportunities in its core markets.

Cash flow remains excellent, with underlying operating cash flow of 
£1,825 million1 (2022: £1,351 million) and underlying free cash flow 
of £1,241 million1 (2022: £890 million), representing strong 
conversion rates of 86.0%1 and 58.5%1, respectively. As a result, 
leverage (net debt to EBITDA) reduced further to 1.2x1.

Our strong balance sheet provides us with flexibility to invest in future 
growth, where we continue to see exciting opportunities, both in terms 
of M&A, where we have an attractive pipeline, and organically, where 
the market remains buoyant. We therefore expect capital expenditure 
to be around 3.5% of underlying revenue in 2024, with net M&A 
expenditure likely to be higher than in 2023.

Strategy

We are a global leader in the provision of food services, our core offer, 
complemented by our targeted support services business. Our 
addressable food market is estimated to be worth at least $300 billion, 
in the markets and sectors we currently operate in, with about half of 
the market still operated in-house. Heightened client and consumer 
expectations and inflation have contributed to the acceleration of 
growth, particularly in the conversion of first-time outsourcing, and we 
have clear strategic priorities to capture these opportunities.

Our portfolio of sector-specific brands enables us to differentiate our 
offer and leverage our industry expertise by creating tailored solutions 
for our clients to align with their own organisational priorities. This 
approach helps us become strategic partners to our clients with 
shared objectives across a range of initiatives, such as digital 
capability, sustainability, people development and increasingly as a 
trusted advisor.

Through our strategic pillars of People, Performance and Purpose, 
combined with our operational performance and capital allocation 
framework, we aim to generate higher compounding value for all our 
stakeholders over the long term.

People

At Compass, we know that our success is largely down to the skills and 
ingenuity of our chefs and front line teams. They lead the way in safe 
and sustainable food at scale, promoting healthier choices and 
creating great experiences for the people we serve. 

We work to ensure that people who want to pursue a career in the food 
and hospitality industry can succeed with Compass. We encourage 
new joiners to make use of innovative tools, such as digital onboarding 
applications and training programmes, with more than 1,500 
colleagues in our UK & Ireland business signing up to our landmark 
training and development scheme, Compass Career Pathways. 
Pleasingly, over 50% of those who have completed the programme 
have moved or been promoted into a new role. 

Having people from diverse backgrounds in Compass is a huge 
strength for our businesses. In the US, over 17,000 Compass 
employees completed diversity, equity and inclusion training, whilst 
our Be the Difference conference in July 2023 was attended by more 
than 2,000 colleagues to discuss empowering front line talent, 
exploring neurodiversity and the importance of allyship.

We are also addressing inequalities and opportunity gaps within the 
hospitality industry by supporting women chefs with dedicated 
training, leadership development programmes and advancement 
opportunities. Our Women in Culinary (WiC) programme in the US is 
driving cultural change as well as career growth, igniting executive 
allyship and fostering kind kitchens.

Through our strategic pillars of People, 
Performance and Purpose, combined with our 
operational performance and capital allocation 
framework, we aim to generate higher 
compounding value for all our stakeholders 
over the long term.

Talent development and careers remain a key opportunity and is 
important for our people. We will continue to build out our Compass 
Academy concept and enhance career pathways in our markets with a 
particular focus on culinary and leadership skills.

Purpose

Our Planet Promise is Compass Group’s global commitment to a 
sustainable future for all. It encompasses our values as an ethical, 
sustainable and inclusive business, together with our ambition to 
positively impact the world. Compass is committed to be carbon 
neutral worldwide on its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030, and 
reach climate net zero GHG emissions across its global operations and 
value chain by 2050.

Our ability to demonstrate progress in reducing our carbon impact and 
food waste is helping us to attract new clients for whom sustainability 
is a major focus. Most have their own ambitious climate plans and 
they rely on us as a trusted partner to help them achieve their 
sustainability goals. Together with Compass, clients and consumers in 
every market can navigate towards a less wasteful, healthier 
plant-forward lifestyle.

Reducing food waste is one of the biggest environmental challenges 
facing our sector, and therefore one where we have the greatest 
potential to make a significant difference. Our culinary teams and 
front line staff are instrumental in tackling this challenge, employing a 
range of diverse food waste reduction technology systems across our 
markets. This year, we made food waste reduction our top priority. Our 
target was to adopt food waste tracking technology in 6,000 locations 
and, with every region united in support, we achieved nearly 8,000 
locations.

Summary

Performance this year has been pleasing across our key metrics of 
revenue, profit and cash. Favourable market conditions, persistent 
inflation and our flexible operating model continued to support strong 
balanced net new business growth across all our regions, with 
first-time outsourcing accounting for c.50% of new wins.

Our large addressable market has a long structural runway for growth 
and, with increasing complexity and heightened expectations from 
clients and consumers, we expect to sustain growth higher than our 
historical average. We have clear strategic priorities to capture these 
exciting opportunities by focusing on our core markets and evolving 
our operating model.

Strong profit growth and cash generation underpin our robust balance 
sheet giving us options for capital allocation. The total dividend for the 
year of 43.1 pence is complemented by a share buyback of up to 
$500 million (£410 million), subject to M&A activity, in line with our 
recent returns to shareholders. As we continue to create value from 
disciplined capital allocation, we continue to explore attractive M&A 
opportunities to capture future sources of growth. 

Looking further ahead, we remain excited about the significant global 
structural growth opportunities, leading to revenue and profit growth 
above historical rates. With our proven model of value creation 
through operations and capital allocation, we will continue rewarding 
shareholders with compounding returns over the long term.

Health and safety

Safety culture

At Compass safety is our number one operational priority. 
Our collective values and practices promote education and 
collaboration with a focus on continuous improvement. 
People are at the heart of our business so taking care of them 
is of the utmost importance to us.

Evolving our systems

As our business continues to grow, so does our investment in safety 
management systems. Compass’ safety platforms are structured to 
manage risk and enhance operational performance. Investment in 
systems provides a proactive approach to compliance, operational 
efficiency, data-driven decisions and leadership safety interactions. 
At Compass, safety performance is continuously monitored, 
transparently reported and considered at every meeting of the 
Board and Corporate Responsibility Committee. 

Personal safety

Our safety culture emphasises the fundamental importance of 
incident prevention and intervention. Through awareness, information 
and training, we empower our people to take individual and collective 
responsibility for their own safety and the safety of those around them. 
This is further embedded by our network of safety leaders operating at 
every level within our businesses. In 2023, our global Lost Time 
Incident Frequency Rate (LTIFR) fell to 1.98, below the limit of 2.60 
set at the beginning of the year. There has been a 34% reduction in 
incident numbers compared to the 2019 baseline. 

Food safety

Compass’ core values and safety protocols guide the decisions, 
actions and behaviours of our people and serve as a foundation for the 
way our businesses operate. Suppliers undergo a rigorous approval 
process, with any areas for improvement remedied to mitigate wider 
risks. An increasing number of our businesses’ sites operate to 
ISO 22000 food safety management system standards or similar Safe 
Quality Food (SQF) standards. Food safety training is delivered at the 
local level to account for unique market risks associated with food 
hygiene and allergen regulations. We take a robust approach to any 
food safety incidents, with protocols in place to report and respond 
rapidly. Learnings are shared internally to continually evaluate and 
improve practices. In 2023, we achieved a Food Safety Incident Rate 
(FSIR) rate of 0.15, below our limit of 0.20. Our focus on Global Food 
Safety has led to a reduced rate of incidents on a 5-year basis (down 
25%), despite our business having grown significantly since 2019.

Safety governance

We continue to diligently focus on a culture of care, respect and 
safety; empowering our people to adopt behaviours that keep them 
free from harm while delivering for clients and consumers. Safety 
learnings are shared right across the business with a safety moment at 
the start of management meetings, whilst Board and Executive 
Committee meetings regularly feature health and safety updates. 
The Corporate Responsibility Committee reviews the Group’s Health 
and Safety Policies annually to ensure that they continue to reflect our 
aims and aspirations and remain fit for purpose.

Safety targets

The practice of transparently reporting safety performance 
encourages a culture of accountability and contributes to continuous 
improvement in safety practices. Countries are required to report 
monthly on their LTIFR and FSIR. These key performance indicators 
are linked to the annual bonus plan for executive directors and other 
senior management.

See page 116 of our Remuneration Committee report for more 
information.

Our safety performance against targets continued to improve in 2023. 
Since 2019, we have delivered a 34% reduction in the LTIFR and a 
25% reduction in the FSIR respectively. A reduction in LTIFR 
correlates with an improving safety culture; reducing cases where our 
colleagues are away from work for more than a shift as a result of a 
work-related injury. A reduction in FSIR is a helpful measure of our 
ability to provide quality food that is safe to our consumers, as 
measured by cases of substantiated food safety incidents. 

See our KPIs on page 7 for more information.

Priorities for the year ahead

The business will prioritise initiatives that further a holistic safety 
culture; one of those initiatives is the move to measuring personal 
injury rates focusing on Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate 
(TRIFR) rather than LTIFR for 2024 onwards. TRIFR emphasises the 
importance of preventing all injuries and is a more comprehensive 
assessment of personal safety, reflecting the continuing maturity of 
our organisation. We will look to further scale technologies that 
support the safeguarding of our people, enable better practice sharing 
around training, and provide a forum for our global safety 
professionals to connect in a common purpose. 

Ethics and integrity

Doing what is right

Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

Doing what is right

Training and awareness

Compass has a passionate commitment to uphold the highest 
standards of ethics and integrity (E&I) which has earned us our 
position as a global leader and trusted partner. We believe in 
responsible leadership; we aim to set the standard and act as a role 
model for ethical behaviour. Through an inclusive culture, we promote 
a workplace where our people and partners can speak up and be 
heard. Our values, commitments and Code of Business Conduct 
(CBC) guide the decisions, actions and behaviours of our people and 
serve as a foundation for the way our businesses conduct themselves.

Our E&I programme

Our risk-based programme and policy framework provide the 
minimum standards, expectations and guidance for Compass’ 
employees and those who act on our behalf, to ensure business is 
conducted in an ethical, fair and responsible way.

Through communication, awareness and training, we empower, 
encourage and equip our people to spot red flags and make well-
informed integrity-driven decisions. This year, we expanded our 
Group-wide target training population to include all Legal, Sales, 
Finance, Internal Audit, Procurement, Growth and Retention teams in 
addition to our Board of Directors and all executive management, 
leader and above-unit manager roles at Group, region and country 
level. Our global E&I awareness week involved all our countries, 
targeting an audience of over 100,000 employees across the Group’s 
businesses, and resulted in 6,500 participants electing to become E&I 
ambassadors. To set clear expectations of our ethical behaviours and 
values, we refreshed the new starter training programme for unit 
managers and above, covering key E&I principles. Following a 
successful pilot, a phased implementation plan for the new starter 
training has commenced and will continue into 2024.

Global initiatives

Pledge and declaration

Committed to continued improvement, this year we have prioritised:

 – refreshing and relaunching our CBC
 – launching our Business Integrity Policy
 – introducing an annual E&I awareness week, focused on embedding 
E&I principles within our countries through a leader-led approach
 – strengthening integrity due diligence, with the introduction of a new 
Third-Party Integrity Due Diligence process, piloted in 10 countries 
 – improving governance and management reporting through phased 

implementation of E&I committees

 – supporting further embedding of Compass’ Human Rights Policy 

through programme awareness activities and e-learning 

To confirm understanding of and compliance with the CBC, our annual 
self-certification process requires all our target training population of 
around 18,000 employees globally (2022: around 13,000) to provide 
a pledge and declaration covering key business integrity risk areas 
and conflict of interest disclosures.

Priorities for the year ahead

In partnership with the businesses and our community of E&I leaders, 
we will prioritise our initiatives in accordance with our strategic plan as 
approved by the Corporate Responsibility Committee. These priorities 
include continuing to embed third-party integrity due diligence as part 
of local country processes, improving management of high-risk third 
parties, enhancing monitoring and oversight procedures, and 
optimising our E&I suite of tools and technologies.

Ethics and integrity continued

Speak Up, We’re Listening is our confidential reporting programme 
that is accessible to anyone, available 24/7 365 days a year and 
is managed by Group E&I, a team independent of any other lines 
of business.

In 2023, our Speak Up, We’re Listening programme received a total 
of 4,130 reports (2022: 3,176), from employees in the Group, 
contractors and external parties. Positive engagement with the 
programme is observed through increased reporting, and accessibility 
through the use of QR codes which are displayed on key policies and 
other communications materials such as posters. In 2023, the QR 
code was scanned 7,713 times across 38 countries.

Of the total reports made to Speak Up, 1,386 involved issues that 
were non-ethics-related matters and were typically referred to internal 
teams for follow-up rather than requiring an ethics investigation. The 
remaining 2,814 were ethics-related matters assessed as potential

concerns, 14% (398) business integrity, 5% (132) health, safety and 
sustainability, and 1% (41) finance.

Whilst 62% (1,735) of reporters elected to remain anonymous 
(2022: 1,268), the overall substantiation rate for 2023 was 38% 
(2022: 34%), which reflects optimisations in investigation processes 
including more consistent engagement with reporters to develop and 
better understand concerns raised. At Compass, we take all matters 
raised through Speak Up very seriously and ensure our reporters hear 
back from the programme, and that appropriate actions are taken 
with respect to concerns raised. In 2023, the four most common case 
outcomes relating to substantiated issues were coaching (37%) 
feedback (33%), warning (13%) and termination of employment (7%). 
Other outcomes (10%) included referral to another process, training 
and employee performance improvement.

Compass Group and all of its Group companies strongly encourage 
raising concerns about improper behaviour or possible violations of 
our CBC, other policies or laws. Compass strictly prohibits and does 
not tolerate retaliation or detrimental conduct in response to anyone 
raising a concern, irrespective of the outcome. In a 2023 integrity 
pulse survey, 87% of our employees* stated that they speak up when 
things do not feel right.

Performance

Step change in Europe performance

With the majority of the food services market still self-operated or in the hands 
of regional players, the outsourcing opportunity in Europe remains significant.

We are capitalising on this potential, with net new business growth in Europe now 
much higher than our historical rate. This reflects both higher new business wins 
and an improving retention rate. 

A stronger growth mentality is being embedded in our European business which 
is benefiting from investments made in its people, brands, and processes. We are 
being more proactive in our approach to winning new business and retaining 
clients, which has resulted in a larger sales pipeline, increased conversion rates 
and better retention rates.

Largely driven by this step change in Europe performance, we now expect the 
Group’s net new business growth rate to be sustained in the 4-5% range, above 
our historical level of around 3%.

Statutory results

We manage and assess the performance of the Group using various 
underlying and other Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). 
These measures are not defined by International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) or other generally accepted accounting principles

companies. Underlying measures reflect ongoing trading and, 
therefore, facilitate meaningful year-on-year comparison. The Group’s 
APMs, together with the results prepared in accordance with IFRS, 
provide comprehensive analysis of the Group’s results. Accordingly, 
the relevant statutory measures are also presented where appropriate. 
Certain of the Group’s APMs are financial Key Performance Indicators

Statutory income statement

Underlying income statement

On a statutory basis, revenue increased by 21.6% to £31,028 million 
(2022: £25,512 million).

Statutory operating profit was £1,891 million (2022: £1,500 million), 
an increase of 26.1%, mainly reflecting the higher revenue and margin 
improvement, together with favourable exchange translation.

Statutory operating profit includes non-underlying item charges of 
£231 million (2022: £90 million), including acquisition-related 
charges of £125 million (2022: £92 million) and charges related to the 
strategic portfolio review of £99 million (2022: £nil) reflecting the 
impact of site closures and contract renegotiations and terminations 
in the UK. A full list of non-underlying items is included in note 34 
(non-GAAP measures).

The Group has recognised a net gain of £20 million on the sale and 
closure of businesses (2022: net loss of £7 million), including exit 
costs of £11 million (2022: £7 million), which largely relates to the 
strategic portfolio review. As a result of this ongoing review of non-core 
activities, the Group exited seven tail countries and sold a non-core 
business in the UK during the year. Subsequent to the year-end, the 
Group also exited its businesses in Argentina and Angola.

Finance costs increased to £164 million (2022: £24 million) due to an 
increase in interest rates, the cost of the additional debt issued in 
September 2022 and a partial reversal of the fair value gains on 
derivatives held to minimise volatility in short-term underlying finance 
costs recognised in the prior year.

Profit before tax was £1,747 million (2022: £1,469 million) giving rise 
to an income tax expense of £429 million (2022: £352 million), 
equivalent to an effective tax rate of 24.6% (2022: 24.0%). The 
increase in rate primarily reflects the increase in the UK corporate  
tax rate from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023 and the impact of 
non-taxable non-underlying items, partly offset by the reassessment of 
risk in respect of prior year uncertain items.

Basic earnings per share was 75.4 pence (2022: 62.6 pence), 
an increase of 20.4%, reflecting the higher profit for the year.

Organic revenue growth of 18.8% reflects net new business growth of 
approximately 5%, above historical levels of approximately 3%, with 
like-for-like volume growth and pricing both at around 7%. Following 
strong like-for-like volume growth in the first half of the year, due to 
the pandemic-impacted comparators, volume growth normalised in 
the second half of the year as anticipated. Pleasingly, organic revenue 
growth continues to be broad-based, with all the Group’s regions 
performing strongly.

Underlying operating profit increased by 29.6% on a constant-
currency basis, to £2,122 million, and our underlying operating 
margin was 6.8% (2022: 6.2%), with all regions achieving significant 
margin progression. The strong improvement in margin reflects the 
benefits of operating leverage, operational efficiencies and 
appropriate pricing to manage inflation headwinds, and is despite 
mobilisation costs associated with new business growth.

Underlying finance costs increased to £136 million (2022: £100 million) 
mainly due to an increase in interest rates and the cost of the 
additional debt issued in September 2022.

On an underlying basis, the tax charge was £481 million (2022: £365 
million), equivalent to an effective tax rate of 24.2% (2022: 24.5%). 
The decrease in rate primarily reflects the reassessment of prior year 
tax estimates and the resolution of open items, partly offset by the 
increase in the UK corporate tax rate from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023. 
The tax environment continues to be uncertain, with more challenging 
tax authority audits and enquiries globally.

On a constant-currency basis, underlying basic earnings per share 
increased by 32.5% to 86.1 pence (2022: 65.0 pence) reflecting the 
higher profit for the year.

Liquidity

Net debt

The Group finances its operations through cash generated by the 
business and borrowings from a number of sources, including banking 
institutions, the public and the private placement markets. The Group 
has developed long-term relationships with a number of financial 
counterparties with the balance sheet strength and credit quality to 
provide credit facilities as required.

The Group seeks to avoid a concentration of debt maturities in any 
one period to spread its refinancing risk. A €500 million (£438 million) 
Eurobond matured and was repaid in January 2023. The maturity 
profile of the Group’s principal borrowings at 30 September 2023 
shows that the average period to maturity is 3.3 years 
(2022: 3.9 years).

The Group’s US Private Placement (USPP) notes contain leverage and 
interest cover covenants which are tested semi-annually at 31 March 
and 30 September. The leverage covenant test stipulates that 
consolidated net debt must be less than or equal to 3.5 times 
consolidated EBITDA. The interest cover covenant test stipulates 
that consolidated EBITDA must be more than or equal to 3 times 
consolidated net finance costs. Consolidated EBITDA and net finance 
costs are based on the preceding 12 months. The leverage and 
interest cover ratios were 1.0 times and 27.6 times, respectively, at 
30 September 2023. Net debt, consolidated EBITDA and net finance 
costs are subject to certain accounting adjustments for the purposes 
of the covenant tests. The covenant tests are shown in note 19 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

At 30 September 2023, the Group had access to £2,680 million 
(2022: £3,732 million) of liquidity, including £2,000 million (2022: 
£2,000 million) of undrawn bank facilities committed to August 2026 
and £680 million (2022: £1,732 million) of cash, net of overdrafts. 
Our credit ratings remain strong investment grade: Standard & Poor’s 
A/A-1 long-term/short-term (outlook Stable) and, following a rating 
upgrade in October 2023, Moody’s A2/P-1 long-term/short-term 
(outlook Stable). 

Net debt has increased by £663 million to £3,653 million (2022: 
£2,990 million). The Group generated £1,166 million of free cash flow, 
after investing £899 million in capital expenditure, which was more 
than offset by £287 million spent on the acquisition of subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates, net of disposal proceeds, dividends of 
£648 million and the share buyback of £929 million. Favourable 
exchange translation was £168 million.

The ratio of net debt to market capitalisation of £35,708 million at 
30 September 2023 was 10.2% (2022: 9.3%). At 30 September 2023, 
the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was 1.2x (2022: 1.3x). Our 
leverage policy is to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings 
and to target net debt to underlying EBITDA in the range of 1x-1.5x.

Post-employment benefits

The Group has continued to review and monitor its pension obligations 
throughout the year, working closely with the trustees and actuaries of 
all schemes across the Group to ensure appropriate assumptions are 
used and adequate provision and contributions are made.

The accounting surplus in the Compass Group Pension Plan reduced 
to £430 million at 30 September 2023 (2022: £581 million) mainly 
reflecting a decrease in the market value of plan assets, partly offset 
by an increase in the discount rate, net of inflation, used to measure 
the liabilities. The deficit in the rest of the Group’s defined benefit 
pension schemes has increased to £806 million (2022: £759 million). 
The net deficit in these schemes is £106 million (2022: £108 million) 
including investments of £700 million (2022: £651 million) held in 
respect of unfunded pension schemes and the US Rabbi Trust 
which do not meet the definition of pension assets under IAS 19 
Employee Benefits.

The total pensions operating charge for defined contribution schemes 
in the year was £208 million (2022: £175 million) and £30 million 
(2022: £24 million) for defined benefit schemes.

Return on capital employed

Return on capital employed was 19.5% (2022: 15.8%) based on net 
underlying operating profit after tax at the underlying effective tax rate 
of 24.2% (2022: 24.5%). The increase mainly reflects the higher 
profit, partly offset by higher average capital employed. The average 
capital employed was £8,215 million (2022: £7,567 million).

Free cash flow

Dividends paid

Free cash flow totalled £1,166 million (2022: £823 million). During 
the year, we made cash payments totalling £58 million (2022: £57 million) 
in relation to restructuring and strategic programmes and the one-off 
pension charge. Adjusting for this, and for acquisition transaction 
costs of £17 million (2022: £10 million) which are reported as part of 
operating cash flow, underlying free cash flow was £1,241 million 
(2022: £890 million), with underlying free cash flow conversion at 
58.5% (2022: 56.0%).

Capital expenditure of £899 million (2022: £704 million) is equivalent 
to 2.9% (2022: 2.7%) of underlying revenue. The working capital 
outflow, excluding provisions and pensions, was £98 million (2022: 
£159 million). The net interest outflow increased to £120 million 
(2022: £86 million) consistent with the higher underlying finance costs 
in the year. The net tax paid was £441 million (2022: £332 million), which 
is equivalent to an underlying cash tax rate of 22.2% (2022: 22.3%).

Acquisition and disposal of businesses

The total cash spent on business acquisitions during the year, net of 
cash acquired, was £351 million (2022: £303 million), including £285 
million of bolt-on acquisitions and interests in joint ventures and 
associates, £49 million of deferred and contingent consideration and 
other payments relating to businesses acquired in previous years, and 
£17 million of acquisition transaction costs included in net cash flow 
from operating activities.

The Group received £47 million (2022: £35 million) in respect of 
disposal proceeds net of exit costs, which primarily comprises the sale 
of businesses in the US and Central and Eastern Europe, together with 
a further 28% shareholding in the Japanese Highways business 
classified as an asset held for sale at 30 September 2022.

Dividends paid in 2023 of £648 million represents the 2022 final 
dividend (£387 million) and the 2023 interim dividend (£261 million).

Purchase of own shares

There was a £78 million cash outflow in respect of the completion of 
the £500 million share buyback announced in May 2022, a £251 
million cash outflow in respect of the completion of the £250 million 
share buyback announced in November 2022 and a £600 million 
cash outflow in respect of the £750 million share buyback announced 
in May 2023. The balance of the £750 million share buyback was 
completed in November 2023. In addition, the Compass Group PLC 
All Share Schemes Trust spent £16 million on purchases of the 
Company’s shares to satisfy some of the Group’s liabilities to 
employees for long-term incentive plans.

Foreign exchange translation

The £168 million gain (2022: £251 million loss) on foreign exchange 
translation of net debt primarily arises in respect of the Group’s US 
dollar-denominated USPP notes.

Other non-cash movements

Other non-cash movements primarily comprises fair value movements 
on derivative financial instruments used to manage the Group’s 
interest rate exposure.

Strategic report

Financial review continued

Change in reporting currency

With effect from 1 October 2023, the reporting currency of the Group 
was changed from sterling to US dollars. The change in presentation 
currency will provide investors and other stakeholders with greater 
transparency of the Group’s performance and reduce foreign 
exchange volatility on earnings given that approximately three-
quarters of the Group’s underlying operating profit originates in 
US dollars.

Capital allocation

Our capital allocation framework is clear and unchanged. Our priority 
is to invest in the business to fund growth opportunities, target a 
strong investment-grade credit rating with a leverage target of around 
1x-1.5x net debt to EBITDA and pay an ordinary dividend, with any 
surplus capital being returned to shareholders.

Growth investment consists of: (i) capital expenditure to support 
organic growth in both new business wins and retention of existing 
contracts; and (ii) bolt-on M&A opportunities that strengthen our 
capabilities and broaden our exposure. We have a proven track record 
of strong returns from our investment strategy as evidenced by our 
historical returns on capital employed.

Shareholder returns

Our dividend policy is to pay out around 50% of underlying earnings 
through an interim and final dividend, with the interim dividend 
reflecting around one-third of the total annual dividend.

In determining the level of dividend in any year, the Board considers a 
number of factors, which include but are not limited to:

 – the level of available distributable reserves in the Parent Company
 – future cash commitments and investment requirements to sustain 

the long-term growth prospects of the business

 – potential strategic opportunities
 – the level of dividend cover

Further surpluses, after considering the matters set out above, may be 
distributed to shareholders over time by way of special dividend 
payments, share repurchases or a combination of both.

Compass Group PLC, the Parent Company of the Group, is a 
non-trading investment holding company which derives its 
distributable reserves from dividends paid by subsidiary companies. 
The level of distributable reserves in the Parent Company is reviewed 
annually and the Group aims to maintain distributable reserves that 
provide adequate cover for shareholder returns. The distributable 
reserves of the Parent Company include the distributable portion of 
retained earnings and the own shares reserve totalling £2,379 million 
at 30 September 2023 (2022: £2,969 million).

An interim dividend of 15.0 pence per share (2022: 9.4 pence per 
share), £261 million in aggregate, was paid in July 2023. It is proposed 
that a final dividend of 28.1 pence per share (2022: 22.1 pence per 
share), £482 million in aggregate, be paid on 29 February 2024 to 
shareholders on the register on 19 January 2024. This will result in a 
total dividend for the year of 43.1 pence per share (2022: 31.5 pence 
per share), £743 million in aggregate (2022: £555 million). The 
dividend is covered 2.0 times on an underlying earnings basis.

The final dividend of 28.1 pence will be paid gross and a Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) will be available. The last date for receipt of 
elections for the DRIP will be 8 February 2024.

The Group is in a strong position to fund its dividend, which is well 
covered by cash generated by the business. Details of the Group’s 
going concern assessment can be found on page 151. The ability of 
the Board to maintain its future dividend policy will be influenced by a 
number of the principal risks identified on pages 26 to 30 that could 
adversely impact the performance of the Group, although we believe 
we have the ability to mitigate those risks as outlined on pages 26 to 30.

Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

  21

The £250 million share buyback announced in November 2022 
was completed in March 2023. The £750 million share buyback 
announced in May 2023 was completed in November 2023.  
We have announced a further share buyback of up to $500 million 
(£410 million), to complete in 2024 subject to M&A activity.

In doing so, we act in compliance with the relevant local and 
international laws and disclosure requirements, and we conduct an 
open and transparent relationship with the relevant tax authorities 
that fully complies with the Group’s Code of Business Conduct and 
Business Integrity Policy.

Treasury

The Group manages its liquidity, foreign currency exposure and 
interest rate risk in accordance with the policies set out below.

The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, 
receivables and payables that are used to finance the Group’s 
operations. The Group also uses derivatives, principally interest rate 
swaps, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to 
manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s 
operations. The Group does not trade in financial instruments. 
The Group’s treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact  
of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to manage  
the Group’s financial risks. The Board approves any changes to 
the policies.

Foreign currency risk

The Group’s policy is to balance its principal projected cash flows by 
currency with actual or effective borrowings in the same currency. As 
currency cash flows are generated, they are used to service and repay 
debt in the same currency. Where necessary to implement this policy, 
forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps are taken out 
which, when applied to the actual currency borrowings, convert these 
to the required currency.

The borrowings in each currency can give rise to foreign exchange 
differences on translation into sterling. Where the borrowings are 
either less than, or equal to, the net investment in overseas 
operations, these exchange rate movements are treated as 
movements on reserves and recorded in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income rather than in the 
consolidated income statement.

Non-sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate of 
exchange for the year. Fluctuations in exchange rates have given, and 
will continue to give, rise to translation differences. The Group is only 
partially protected against the impact of such differences through the 
matching of cash flows to currency borrowings.

Interest rate risk

As set out above, the Group has effective borrowings in a number of 
currencies and its policy is to ensure that, in the short term, it is not 
materially exposed to fluctuations in interest rates in its principal 
currencies. The Group implements this policy either by borrowing 
fixed rate debt or by using interest rate swaps so that the interest rates 
on at least 80% of the Group’s projected debt are fixed for one year. 
For the second and third year, interest rates are fixed within ranges of 
30% to 70% and 0% to 40% of projected debt, respectively.

Tax

As a Group, we are committed to creating long-term shareholder value 
through the responsible, sustainable and efficient delivery of our key 
business objectives. This will enable us to grow the business and make 
significant investments in the Group and its operations.

We adopt an approach to tax that supports this strategy and also 
balances the various interests of our stakeholders, including 
shareholders, governments, employees and the communities in which 
we operate. Our aim is to pursue a principled and sustainable tax 
strategy that has strong commercial merit and is aligned with our 
business strategy. We believe this will enhance shareholder value 
whilst protecting our reputation.

After many years of operation, the Group has numerous legacy 
subsidiaries across the world. Whilst some of these entities are 
incorporated in low-tax territories, Compass does not seek to  
avoid tax through the use of tax havens. Details of the Group’s  
related undertakings are listed in note 36 to the consolidated 
financial statements.

In an increasingly complex international corporate tax environment, 
a degree of tax risk and uncertainty is, however, inevitable. Tax risk 
can arise from unclear regulations and differences in interpretation 
but, most significantly, where tax authorities apply diverging 
standards in assessing intra-group cross-border transactions. 
This is the situation for many multinational organisations. We 
manage and control these risks in a proactive manner and, in 
doing so, exercise our judgement and seek appropriate advice 
from relevant professional firms. Tax risks are assessed as part of 
the Group’s formal governance process and are reviewed by the 
Board and the Audit Committee on a regular basis.

Risks and uncertainties

The Board takes a proactive approach to risk management aimed 
at protecting the Group’s employees, clients and consumers and 
safeguarding the interests of the Company and its shareholders in a 
constantly changing environment.

The principal risks and uncertainties facing the business, and the 
activities the Group undertakes to mitigate these, are set out on 
pages 26 to 30.

Related party transactions

Details of transactions with related parties are set out in note 32 to the 
consolidated financial statements. These transactions have not had, 
and are not expected to have, a material effect on the financial 
performance or position of the Group.

Going concern

The factors considered by the directors in assessing the ability of the 
Group and Parent Company to continue as a going concern are 
discussed on page 151.

The Group has access to considerable financial resources, together 
with longer-term contracts with a number of clients and suppliers 
across different geographic areas and industries. As a consequence, 
the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully.

Based on the assessment discussed on page 151, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and Parent Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 
the period to 31 March 2025. For this reason, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Operating margin increased by 60bps to 7.8% in spite of inflation 
headwinds driven by management focus on productivity, cost 
mitigation and appropriate pricing, in addition to ongoing 
scale benefits.

The region invested in several bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our 
capabilities, including the acquisition of Parks Coffee in the first half 
of the year, a provider of workplace refreshments in the US. 

Statutory

Statutory revenue increased by 23.1% to £21,073 million reflecting 
the strong organic revenue growth and favourable exchange translation.

Statutory operating profit was £1,581 million (2022: £1,183 million), 
with the difference from underlying operating profit being acquisition-
related charges of £72 million (2022: £57 million).

The region invested in bolt-on acquisitions, most notably to drive 
additional procurement efficiencies in the UK and to expand our 
footprint in the Education sector in Ireland. Since the year-end, we 
have agreed to acquire Hofmann Menü-Manufaktur GmbH, a German 
producer of high-quality cook and freeze meals, to add new capability 
and distribution networks. As part of the Group’s ongoing strategic 
portfolio review, we exited five businesses in Central and Eastern 
Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Estonia) to 
focus resources and investment on core operations.

Statutory

Statutory revenue increased by 19.5% to £6,804 million, with the 
difference from underlying revenue being the presentation of the 
share of results of our joint ventures operating in the Middle East. 

Statutory operating profit was £240 million (2022: £267 million),  
with the difference from underlying operating profit mainly reflecting 
charges related to the Group’s ongoing strategic portfolio review of 
£99 million (2022: £nil), including site closures and contract 
reorganisations and terminations in the UK, and acquisition-related 
charges of £46 million (2022: £30 million).

As part of the Group’s ongoing strategic portfolio review, we exited 
Azerbaijan and Indonesia during the year and, subsequent to the 
year-end, our operations in Argentina and Angola.

Statutory

Statutory revenue increased by 16.8% to £3,151 million. There is no 
difference between statutory and underlying revenue.

Statutory operating profit was £168 million (2022: £137 million), 
with the difference from underlying operating profit being  
acquisition-related charges of £7 million (2022: £4 million).

North America

Underlying

Operating profit increased by 28.0% on a constant-currency basis, 
to £1,653 million, driven by strong organic revenue growth and 
continued margin progression. 

Organic revenue growth was 17.4%, with new business wins benefiting 
from significant levels of first-time outsourcing, strong retention rates 
at 96.9%, appropriate levels of pricing and like-for-like volume growth 
underpinned by the scaling of digital capabilities.

Growth was broad-based across all sectors. Business & Industry 
benefited from double-digit net new business growth and favourable 
like-for-like volume growth as employees continued to return to the 
office. Sports & Leisure benefited from high participation rates and per 
capita spend, but also a strong calendar of events, including basketball, 
hockey, baseball, music and convention centres. Our Education and 
Healthcare & Senior Living businesses also delivered strong growth 
from net new business, like-for-like volume growth and pricing.

Europe

Underlying

Operating profit was £392 million, growth of 31.5% on a constant-
currency basis, driven by high levels of revenue growth and strong 
margin progression, supported by our investment in growth initiatives 
and core processes across the region.

Organic revenue growth of 21.6% was driven by net new business 
growth, strong volume growth and pricing. Client retention rates 
improved by a further 70bps to 96.0%.

Double-digit organic revenue growth rates were achieved across all 
sectors and, most notably, in Business & Industry, Education and 
Sports & Leisure, which all benefited from high levels of net new 
business, like-for-like volume growth and pricing. Growth was strong in 
all major markets, most notably in the UK, Germany and Türkiye, 
which all made a significant contribution to the region.

Margin progression of 60bps, which resulted in an operating margin  
of 5.6%, was achieved by controlling costs to maximise operating 
leverage and by continuing to work closely with clients to mitigate the 
sustained level of inflationary pressures within the region. 

Rest of World

Underlying

Operating profit increased to £175 million, which represents growth of 
30.6% on a constant-currency basis.

Organic revenue growth was 21.8% reflecting high net new business 
growth, strong levels of like-for-like volume growth and pricing. 
Client retention rates improved by 90bps to 95.4%.

Organic revenue growth was broad-based across all sectors. Growth 
was particularly pleasing in our Business & Industry sector across 
most markets, notably in India and Japan, as office attendance levels 
increased, and in our more defensive Defence, Offshore & Remote 
sector, especially in Australia and Chile, where like-for-like volume 
growth and net new business levels were high.

Operating margin increased by 40bps to 5.6% driven by strong 
management focus on operational challenges in the region, 
including the sustained levels of inflation and labour shortages 
in certain markets.

Risk management

Identifying and  
managing risk

The Board takes a proactive approach to risk management aimed 
at protecting the Group’s employees, clients and consumers and 
safeguarding the interests of the Company and its shareholders 
in a constantly changing environment.

Risk management is an essential element of business governance. 
The Group has risk management policies, processes and procedures 
in place to ensure that risks are properly identified, evaluated and 
managed at the appropriate level.

The identification of risks and opportunities, the development of 
action plans to manage those risks and maximise the opportunities, 
and the continual monitoring of progress against agreed key 
performance indicators (KPIs) are integral parts of the business 
process and core activities throughout the Group.

In compliance with provision 28 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2018 (the Code), the Board has conducted a robust assessment 
of the Company’s emerging and principal risks. The following pages 
set out the Board’s approach to assessing and mitigating risk, the 
principal risks of the Company, and the procedures in place to identify 
emerging risks.

Risk management framework

The Board has overall responsibility for risk management. This 
includes establishing policies and procedures to manage risk, 
overseeing the internal control framework, reviewing the nature and 
extent of the principal risks, setting risk appetite and embedding a 
culture of risk management throughout the business.

The Board has approved a Risk Management Policy. The Group 
operates a formal risk management process in accordance with this 
policy, under which the Group’s principal risks (set out on pages 26 
to 30) are assessed and prioritised biannually. In accordance with the 
FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial Business Reporting 2014 and in the Code, this process has 
been in place for the financial year under review. These systems are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
the Group’s strategic objectives, safeguard the Group’s assets against 
material loss, fairly report the Group’s performance and position, and 
ensure compliance with relevant legislation, regulation and best 
practice including that related to social, environmental and ethical 
matters. These systems provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.

The Board delegates aspects of risk management, with the Executive 
Committee responsible for the day-to-day management of significant 
risk, and the Audit Committee responsible for the oversight of 
Compass’ risk management systems and internal financial controls. 
The Group Director of Risk and Internal Audit maintains the risk 
management framework including the Risk Management Policy. 
The Audit Committee annually reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s approach to risk management and any changes to the 
Risk Management Policy, and recommends the principal risks and 
uncertainties disclosures made in the Annual Report and Accounts 
to the Board for approval. The Audit Committee’s report is on 
pages 82 to 88.

Risks and the corresponding controls and mitigations are reviewed 
by country and regional leadership teams on an ongoing basis. 
Risk updates are integral to periodic management reviews and are 
regularly reviewed by the Regional Governance Committees (RGCs) 
and the Executive Committee. A critical component of the risk review 
process is the dynamic identification of emerging and developing risks 
at a country, regional and Group level. This bottom-up and top-down 
approach provides a comprehensive assessment of the key risks 
facing the Group. The findings of the risk reviews, including the 
principal risks and any developing trends, are reported to and 
considered by the Board twice a year.

Risks are considered at gross and net levels. This allows the impact 
of each risk and likelihood of its occurrence both before and after 
controls and mitigations to be assessed. Risk management plans are 
developed for all significant risks. They include a clear description of 
the nature of the risk, quantification of the potential impact and 
likelihood of occurrence, the owners for each risk, and details of the 
controls and mitigations in place, proportionate to the risk, and in line 
with the Company’s business. The identification and assessment of 
climate-related risks and opportunities are incorporated within the risk 
management process. All country operating units are mandated to 
consider climate-related risks and opportunities. These are assessed 
in terms of percentage profit before interest and tax (PBIT) impact in 
accordance with the criteria set out in the Board-approved Risk 
Management Policy. All country and Group-level risks are assigned 
risk owners and, together with the mitigations, are recorded in the 
central risk reporting system.

Group companies also submit biannual risk and internal control 
assurance letters to the Group CFO on internal control and risk 
management issues, with comments on the control environment 
within their operations. The Chair of the Audit Committee reports to 
the Board on any matters arising from the Committee’s review of 
how the risk management and internal control processes have 
been applied.

The Audit Committee keeps under review the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Company’s and Group’s internal financial 
controls and risk management systems. These are discussed in 
further detail in the Audit Committee report on pages 82 to 88.

Risk appetite

The Board interprets risk appetite as the level of risk that the Company 
is willing to take to meet its strategic objectives. The Board’s attitude 
to and appetite for risk are communicated to the Group’s businesses 
through the strategy planning process and the internal risk 
governance and control frameworks. In determining its risk appetite, 
the Board recognises that a prudent and robust approach to risk 
mitigation must be carefully balanced with a degree of flexibility 
so that the entrepreneurial spirit that has greatly contributed to 
the Group’s success is not inhibited.

In assessing risk appetite, the Board reviews the three-year business 
plan and associated strategic risks. Risk appetite for specific financial 
risks such as funding and liquidity, credit, counter-party, foreign 
exchange and interest rate risk are set out in the Board approved 
treasury policies. Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, 
such as those contained in the Companies Act, health and safety and 
other risk-specific legislation, is mandatory.

New and emerging risks

The Board has established processes for identifying emerging risks, 
and horizon scanning for risks that may arise over the medium to 
long term. Emerging and potential changes to the Group’s risk profile 
are identified through the Group’s risk management framework and 
through direct feedback from management, including in regard to 
changing operating conditions, and market and consumer trends. 

The democratisation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has given 
widespread access to powerful online AI services for content creation. 
This opportunity presents several risks including breach of data 
confidentiality and data privacy. In response, to mitigate these risks, 
Compass has implemented principle-based rules that apply globally, 
and we are currently developing a framework for the responsible use 
of AI in all our markets.

The escalating tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing Russia-
Ukraine conflict have elevated geopolitical risks and while we do not 
operate directly in those countries currently affected, we do have 
interests elsewhere in Europe and the Middle East. We continue to 
monitor these situations closely with the safety and security of the 
Group’s employees front of mind.

Our principal risks

The principal risks and uncertainties facing the business at the date 
of this Report, and any changes to the status of these risks since last 
year, are set out on pages 26 to 30. These have been subject to robust 
assessment and review.

They do not, however, comprise all the risks that the Group may 
face and are not listed in any order of priority. Additional risks and 
uncertainties not presently known to management, or which are 
considered to be remote or are deemed to be less material at the 
date of this Report, may also have an adverse effect on the Group.

Other principal risks

The Group faces a number of operational risks on an ongoing basis, 
such as litigation and financial risks, as well as some wider risks, for 
example, environmental, information security, cyber and reputational.

All risks disclosed in previous years can be found in the annual 
reports available on our website, www.compass-group.com. 

These risks remain important to the business and are kept under 
regular review. However, the disclosures on pages 26 to 30 focus 
on risks currently considered to be more significant to the Group.

Climate change and sustainability

Mitigation

Climate change

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance/Purpose

The impact of climate change on the environment may lead to 
issues around food sourcing and supply chain continuity in some 
of the Group’s markets. Issues in these areas could affect the 
availability of some food products, and potentially may lead to 
food cost inflation.

Social and ethical standards

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance/Purpose

Compass relies on its people to deliver great service to its clients 
and consumers and recognises that the welfare of employees is 
the foundation of its culture and business. Compass remains 
vigilant in upholding high standards of business ethics with 
regard to human rights and social equality.

Health and safety

Health and safety

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance/Purpose

Compass feeds millions of consumers every day and its companies 
employ hundreds of thousands of people around the world.  
For that reason, setting the highest standards for food hygiene and 
safety is paramount.

Health and safety breaches could cause serious business 
interruption and could result in criminal and civil prosecution, 
increased costs and potential damage to the Company’s reputation.

The Group continues to focus on evaluating its exposure to climate 
change and seeks to identify potential future issues early so that 
sourcing and operations can be adjusted, and menus adapted 
appropriately. Work continues with clients and suppliers to propose, 
execute and measure solutions to support their efforts and those of 
Compass in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Compass 
has targeted climate net zero GHG emissions by 2050 alongside 
validated science-based targets to reduce emissions by 2030 
(from a 2019 base year) in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. 

To enhance its ability to counter risks to its businesses and supply 
chains from modern slavery, Compass has focused on the areas 
where its human rights strategy can have the greatest impact. 
This has been done through the Human Rights Working Group, 
the engagement of external specialist advisers, the Group’s modern 
slavery e-learning tools and ongoing work to strengthen and improve 
the Group’s human rights due diligence through supplier evaluation 
and labour agency reviews.

Management meetings throughout the Group feature a health and 
safety update as one of their first substantive agenda items.

Health and safety improvement KPIs are included in the annual 
bonus plans for each of the businesses’ management teams. The 
Group has policies, procedures and standards in place to ensure 
compliance with legal obligations and industry standards.

The safety and quality of the Group’s global supply chain are assured 
through compliance with a robust set of standards which are 
regularly reviewed, audited and upgraded as necessary to improve 
supply chain visibility and product integrity.

Further mitigations in place include our Global Operational Safety 
Standards, Global Supply Chain Integrity Standards and a Global 
Allergen Management Plan.

Pandemic 

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance/Purpose

The Group’s operations were significantly disrupted due to the 
global COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures. 
Compass has recovered well and learned from the pandemic, and 
as a result this risk has declined. Further outbreaks of the virus, or 
another pandemic, could cause further business risk.

People

Recruitment

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance

Failure to attract and recruit people with the right skills at all levels 
could limit the success of the Group.

The Group faces resourcing challenges in some of its businesses in 
some key positions due to labour shortages and a lack of industry 
experience amongst candidates, appropriately qualified people, 
and the seasonal nature of some of Compass’ businesses.

Retention and motivation

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance

Retaining and motivating the best people with the right skills,  
at all levels of the organisation, is key to the long-term success  
of the Group.

Changes to economic conditions may increase the risk of attrition 
at all levels of the organisation.

Potential business closures resulting from further COVID-19 or 
other pandemic-related lockdowns or other social distancing 
controls could significantly impact the Group’s workforce in 
affected regions.

Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

  27

Mitigation

Operations and working practices have been adjusted to retain  
the skills and experience of colleagues and provide flexibility in the 
event of another pandemic which leads to a resumption of 
containment measures.

To protect the Group’s employees, clients and consumers, 
enhanced health and safety protocols and personal protective 
equipment requirements and guidelines, hygiene requirements and 
site layout solutions developed in consultation with expert advisers 
and with our clients, have been adopted.

Careful management of the Group’s cost base and robust measures 
to protect the Group’s liquidity position have ensured that we remain 
resilient and well placed to take advantage of appropriate 
opportunities as they arise.

Robust incident management and business continuity plans are in 
place and are monitored for effectiveness and regularly reviewed to 
ensure they reflect evolving best practice. 

The Group aims to mitigate this risk by efficient and time-critical 
resource management, mobilisation of existing experienced 
employees within the organisation, improved use of technology such 
as apps and social media, targeted recruitment, and training and 
development programmes.

The Group has established tools, training, development, 
performance management and reward programmes to help retain, 
develop, motivate and support its people.

The Group has a number of well-established initiatives which help to 
monitor levels of engagement and to respond to the needs of 
employees. Specifically, Compass has increased its local focus and 
employee support on mental health awareness, stress management 
and resilience to better equip its people in times of uncertainty 
and change.

To protect its workforce, Compass applies measures available  
to it to retain as many of its skilled workforce as possible, 
including redeployment.

Risk and description

Clients and consumers

Sales and retention

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance

Mitigation

Compass has strategies based on quality, value and innovation that 
strengthen its long-term relationships with its clients and consumers.

The Group’s business model is structured so that it is not reliant on one 
particular sector or group of clients.

The Group’s businesses rely on securing and retaining a diverse 
range of clients.

The potential loss of material client contracts in an increasingly 
competitive market is a risk to Compass’ businesses.

Technology is used to support the delivery of efficiencies and to 
contribute to growth through, for example, cashierless and cashless 
payment systems and the use of artificial intelligence. This is beneficial 
to clients and consumers and positively impacts retention and new 
business wins.

Service delivery, contractual compliance and retention

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance

The Group’s operating companies contract with a large number of 
clients. Failure to comply with the terms of these contracts, 
including proper delivery of services, could lead to the loss of 
business and/or claims.

Competition and disruption

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: Performance

The Group operates in a highly competitive marketplace. The 
levels of concentration and outsource penetration vary by country 
and by sector. Some markets are relatively concentrated with two 
or three key players. Others are highly fragmented and offer 
significant opportunities for consolidation and penetration of the 
self-operated market.

Ongoing structural changes in working and education 
environments may reduce the number of people in offices and 
educational establishments.

The emergence of new industry participants and traditional 
competition using disruptive technology could adversely affect the 
Group’s businesses. 

Economic and political environment

Geopolitical

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance/Purpose

The escalating tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing 
Russia-Ukraine conflict have elevated geopolitical risks, 
heightened national security threats to countries in those regions 
and disrupted the global energy market, which have contributed to 
cost inflation, and economic and cyber-security risks. 

Compass continues to focus on financial security and safety. In today’s 
environment, these are key strengths for clients.

Contracts may be renegotiated. There is continued focus on retention 
and new sales and the use of technology and innovative client solutions.

Processes are in place to ensure that the services delivered to clients 
are of an appropriate standard and comply with the required 
contract terms and conditions.

Compass aims to minimise this risk and to respond to new market 
and consumer food services trends by continuing to promote its 
differentiated propositions and by focusing on its strengths, such as 
flexibility in its cost base, quality, value of service and innovation.

Harnessing knowledge and experience and continuing to invest in 
technology helps to counter any potential risk and to capitalise on 
the opportunities created.

Compass continues to evolve its offer to increase participation rates 
and service sites of different sizes.

The businesses are able to adapt to changes in the service provision 
environment and where possible take advantage of changes in the 
market. By leveraging its expertise and technology Compass is able 
to differentiate its food services offer. For example, investments 
in SmartQ and EAT Club have given Compass platforms that allow 
it to pivot food operations according to changing client and 
consumer demands.

As a Group, Compass is monitoring the situation closely with 
the safety and security of the Group’s employees front of mind. 

Whilst we do not operate in Israel or the Palestinian territories,  
we do have interests elsewhere in the Middle East. Last year, 
Compass permanently exited the Russian market and moved 
away from all known Russian suppliers.

The Group continues to manage inflation risks by sharing best 
practice across the Group to drive greater efficiencies through  
menu management, supplier rationalisation, labour scheduling,  
and productivity through the increased use of technology.  
Cost indexation in our contracts also gives Compass the  
contractual right to review pricing with clients.

Economy

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance/Purpose

Sectors of Compass’ business could be susceptible to adverse 
changes in economic conditions and employment levels.

Continued worsening of economic conditions has increased the 
risk to the businesses in some jurisdictions.

Cost inflation

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance

At Compass, our objective is always to deliver the right level of 
service in the most efficient way. An increase in the cost of labour, 
for example, minimum wages in the US and UK, or the cost of food, 
could constitute a risk to our ability to do this.

Political instability

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance/Purpose

Compass is a global business operating in countries and regions with 
diverse economic and political conditions. Operations and earnings 
may be adversely affected by political or economic instability.

Compliance and fraud

Compliance and fraud

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance/Purpose

Ineffective compliance management with increasingly complex 
laws and regulations, or evidence of fraud, bribery and corruption, 
anti-competitive behaviour or other serious misconduct, could 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s reputation or on 
its performance and/or lead to a reduction in the Company’s share 
price and/or a loss of business. It could also lead to criminal 
proceedings, sanctions or other litigation being brought against the 
Company, its directors or executive management.

Companies face increased risk of fraud, bribery and corruption, 
anti-competitive behaviour and other serious misconduct both 
internally and externally, due to financial and/or performance 
pressures and significant changes to ways of working.

As part of Compass’ strategy, the Group is focused on productivity 
and purchasing initiatives which help to manage the cost base. 
During adverse conditions, if necessary actions can be taken to 
reduce labour costs and action plans have been implemented to 
protect profitability and liquidity.

As part of the MAP framework, and by sharing best practice across 
the Group, Compass seeks to manage inflation by continuing to drive 
greater efficiencies through menu management, supplier 
rationalisation, labour scheduling and productivity, and through the 
increased use of technology. Cost indexation in our contracts also 
gives Compass the contractual right to review pricing with clients.

Cost action programmes and the continued oversight of supply chain 
costs are also mitigating the risks in this area.

The Group remains alert to future changes presented by emerging 
markets or fledgling administrations and tries to anticipate and 
contribute to important changes in public policy.

Where possible, Compass seeks to absorb price increases through 
operational efficiencies. Cost indexation in our contracts also gives 
Compass the contractual right to review pricing with clients.

Recruitment and retention strategies are also in place to mitigate 
any impact on labour supply.

Compass remains vigilant to changes in political stability in local 
jurisdictions and retains the flexibility to take appropriate mitigating 
action as necessary.

The Group’s zero-tolerance-based Code of Business Conduct 
(CBC) and Business Integrity Policy (BIP), govern all aspects of its 
relationships with its stakeholders. Compass operates a continuous 
improvement process as part of the Group’s Ethics and Integrity 
programme to enhance and strengthen its culture of integrity, 
sharing insights and emerging trends between regional and country 
management teams.

The Group undertakes a robust risk management assessment that 
helps identify major risks and ensures the internal control framework 
remains effective through regular monitoring, testing and review. 
Regulatory and compliance risks are included in this process to 
enable visibility and planning to address them.

A strong culture of integrity is promoted through Compass’ Ethics 
and Integrity programme and its independently operated Speak Up, 
We’re Listening helpline and web platform. All alleged breaches of 
the CBC and the BIP, including any allegations of fraud, bribery and 
corruption, anti-competitive behaviour and other serious misconduct, 
are followed up, investigated and dealt with appropriately.

Regulation and compliance risk is also considered as part of the 
annual business planning process.

Our Ethics and Integrity e-learning platform provides increased 
engagement on key regulatory and ethics and integrity topics for 
Group employees and clear communication of standards and 
expectations. Internal Audit regularly reviews internal controls and 
analyses financial transactions to mitigate the risk of error or fraud.

International tax

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: Performance

The international corporate tax environment remains complex and 
the sustained increase in audit activity from tax authorities means 
that the potential for tax uncertainties and disputes remains high. 
The need to raise public finances is likely to cause governments to 
consider increases in tax rates and other potentially adverse 
changes in tax legislation, and to renew focus on compliance for 
large corporates.

Information systems, technology and cyber

2023: 

 2022: 

Strategic pillar link: People/Performance

The digital world creates increasing risk for global businesses 
including, but not limited to, technology failures, loss of 
confidential data, data privacy breaches and damage to brand 
reputation through, for example, the increased threat of cyber-
attacks, and use and instantaneous nature of social media.

Disruption caused by the failure of key software applications, 
security controls, or underlying infrastructure, or disruption caused 
by cyber-attacks could impact day-to-day operations and 
management decision-making, or result in a regulatory fine or 
other sanction and/or third party claims.

The incidence of sophisticated phishing and malware attacks 
(including ransomware) on businesses is rising with an increase in 
the number of companies suffering operational disruption, 
unauthorised access to and/or loss of data, including confidential, 
commercial, and personal identifiable data.

A combination of increased geopolitical, economic instability and 
accessibility of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) enabled 
tools and techniques have contributed to a significant increase in 
the risk of phishing and malware attacks including ransomware 
across all industries. The democratisation of generative AI has 
given widespread access to powerful online AI services for content 
creation. This opportunity presents several risks including to data 
privacy and confidentiality.

Mitigation

Compass seeks to plan and manage its tax affairs efficiently in the 
jurisdictions in which the Group’s businesses operate. Compass acts 
in compliance with relevant laws and disclosure requirements.

Compass manages and controls these risks in a proactive manner 
and in doing so exercises judgement and seeks appropriate advice 
from reputable professional firms. Tax risks are assessed as part of 
the Group’s formal governance process and are reviewed by the 
Board and the Audit Committee on a regular basis.

The Group proactively manages its tax arrangements in accordance 
with various government-led initiatives and ensures compliance is 
achieved by putting robust processes and controls in place, 
including third-party support and review.

Compass continually assesses its cyber risk, and monitors and 
manages the maturity of its enterprise infrastructure, platforms and 
security controls to ensure that it can effectively prevent, detect and 
respond to current or future cyber-attacks.

Appropriate crisis management procedures are in place to manage 
issues in the event of a cyber incident occurring. Our response 
protocols are supported by using industry-standard tooling, 
experienced IT and security professionals, and external partners to 
mitigate potential impacts. Assurance is provided by regular 
compliance monitoring of our key information technology control 
framework, which is designed to prevent and defend against cyber 
threats and other risks.

The Group relies on a variety of digital and technology platforms to 
manage and deliver services and communicate with its people, 
clients, consumers and suppliers. Compass’ decentralised model 
and infrastructure help to mitigate propagation of attacks across 
the Group’s technology estate.

Compass continues to be focused on the need to maximise the 
effectiveness of its information systems and technology as a 
business enabler. As such, the Group continues to invest in 
technology and specialist resources in order to further strengthen 
its platforms, cyber-security defences and controls to prevent and 
detect cyber threats and respond to attacks in order to mitigate the 
risk of operational disruption, technology failure, unauthorised 
access to and/or loss of data.

The Group has implemented configuration changes designed 
to block phishing emails, increased awareness campaigns, 
and provided cyber training to help employees identify these 
kind of attacks.

In response to the potential risks posed by AI, Compass has 
implemented principle-based rules that apply globally, and we are 
currently developing a framework for the responsible use of AI in all 
our markets.

Information systems, technology and cyber-security controls and 
risks are assessed as part of the Group’s formal governance 
processes and are reviewed by the Audit Committee on a 
regular basis.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

Viability statement

In accordance with provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2018, the directors have assessed the Group’s viability, 
considering its current trading performance, financial position, 
financing, strategic plan and principal risks.

The Group’s long-term (A/A2) and short-term (A-1/P-1) credit 
ratings and well-established presence in the debt capital markets 
provide the directors with confidence that the Group could 
refinance the maturing debt and facilities as required.

Business prospects

The Board has considered the long-term prospects of the Group 
based on its business model, strategy and markets as set out on 
pages 2 to 11. Compass is a global leader in food services and the 
geographical and sector diversification of the Group’s operations 
helps to minimise the risk of serious business interruption or 
catastrophic damage to its reputation. The Group’s business model 
is structured so that it is not reliant on one group of clients or sector. 
The Group’s largest client constitutes 2% of underlying revenue, 
with the top 10 clients accounting for 9%.

Assessment

The directors have determined that a three-year period to 
30 September 2026 is an appropriate period over which to provide the 
Group‘s viability statement on the basis that it is the period reviewed 
by the Board in its strategic planning process and is aligned to the 
typical length of the Group’s contracts (three to five years). The 
directors believe that this presents the Board and readers of the 
Annual Report with a reasonable degree of confidence over this 
longer-term outlook.

The Board’s assessment of the Group’s viability comprises the 
following business processes:

 – Risk management process: The Group operates a formal risk 

management process under which the Group’s principal risks are 
assessed and prioritised biannually. Risks and corresponding 
controls and mitigations are reviewed by country and regional 
leadership teams on an ongoing basis. The findings of the risk 
reviews, including the principal risks and any developing trends, 
are reported to the Board twice a year. In making its viability 
assessment, the Board carried out a robust evaluation of the 
emerging and principal risks facing the Group (see pages 26  
to 30), including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity.

 – Strategic planning process: The Board considers annually a 

three-year, bottom-up strategic plan and a more detailed budget 
which is prepared for the following year. Current-year business 
performance is reforecast during the year. The plan is reviewed 
and approved by the Board, with involvement throughout from the 
Group CEO, Group CFO and the Executive team. The Board’s role 
is to consider the appropriateness of key assumptions, taking 
into account the external environment and business strategy. 
The most recent three-year plan was approved by the Board 
in November 2023.

 – Headroom and covenant analysis: At 30 September 2023, the 

Group had £2.0 billion of undrawn committed bank facilities, which 
mature in August 2026, and £0.7 billion of cash net of overdrafts. 
Term debt maturities in the three-year period total £1.8 billion, of 
which £0.3 billion was pre-financed with bond issues in September 
2022. Based on the forecast cash flows in the strategic plan, the 
remainder of the maturing debt is expected to be refinanced during 
the three-year period to 30 September 2026 to maintain the 
desired level of headroom. The £2.0 billion of committed bank 
facilities are expected to be refinanced during 2025.  

A reverse stress test has been undertaken to identify the 
circumstances that would cause the Group to breach the 
headroom against its committed facilities or the financial 
covenants on its USPP debt. The reverse stress test, which 
removes discretionary M&A expenditure and share buybacks 
as mitigating actions, shows that underlying operating profit1 
would have to reduce by more than 80% of the strategic plan 
level throughout the three-year assessment period before the 
leverage covenant is reached. The refinancing requirement is 
not accelerated in the reverse stress test as a mitigating action 
given the strong liquidity position of the Group.

The principal risks that would have the most significant impact 
on the Group’s business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity are further outbreaks of COVID-19 or another pandemic 
and associated containment measures, geopolitical tensions, 
economic conditions and food and labour cost inflation and 
these, together with the other principal risks identified on pages 
26 to 30, have been considered as part of the viability assessment. 
Specific scenarios based on the principal risks have not been 
modelled on the basis that the level of headroom to absorb the 
occurrence of such risks is substantial and there is a range of 
other actions available that could be implemented to mitigate 
the potential impact.

Substantial mitigating actions were identified and implemented 
as part of the Group’s COVID-19 pandemic response in 2020, 
including reducing capital expenditure, resizing the cost base, 
renegotiating client contracts, pausing M&A activity and 
shareholder returns, raising equity, negotiating covenant 
waivers and securing additional committed funding. These 
actions illustrate the flexibility the Group has to mitigate the 
impact of adverse events.

In the event that the financial covenants were to come under 
pressure, mitigating actions include repaying the loan notes from 
available liquidity, or refinancing, in advance of their maturity or 
negotiating covenant waivers.

Conclusion

Based on the results of this analysis, the Board has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period to 
30 September 2026.

Social Promise, Compass Group UK & Ireland

Compass Group UK&I’s Social Promise sets out its aspiration to positively impact one million lives by 
2030 through job creation, education, training and community and charitable engagement. 
Underpinning its Social Promise is a commitment to addressing barriers to progression, particularly in 
relation to gender, race and among those from less-advantaged or under-represented backgrounds.

During the year, Compass Group UK&I worked with Social Value Portal to quantify the social value 
created by its business, which was measured at over £590 million. It also launched a socio-economic 
survey to provide a workforce data baseline for measuring the impact of its social mobility programmes.

In March, the business published its first combined Gender and Ethnic Minority Pay Gap Report, which 
revealed a median ethnicity pay gap of -7.9%3, indicating greater representation for ethnic minority 
employees in higher-paid roles and locations, and a median gender pay gap of 12.6%3 (lower than the 
UK national average of 14.9%).

Most recently, Compass Group UK&I was recognised as a Living Wage Champion at the Living Wage 
Foundation annual awards for its work advocating with over 300 clients to pay the Real Living Wage 
(RLW), with an extra 20,000 colleagues being paid the RLW or above since October 2021.

Putting our people first 

At Compass, we know that our success is largely down to the skills 
and ingenuity of our chefs and front line teams. They lead the way in 
providing sustainable and safe food at scale, promoting healthier 
choices and creating great experiences for the people we serve. 
We feel uniquely positioned to create lifetime opportunities for our 
people and positively impact the communities in which we operate. 

Culture 

Our caring, winning culture makes us a better business. Openness, 
trust and accountability are fundamental to the way we work, and we 
are committed to ensuring that our people are treated fairly and with 
respect, have opportunities to grow and develop, and work in positive, 
supportive teams.

Providing opportunities for all means we value having a diverse and 
inclusive workforce at all levels and we are determined to support 
our people to break through traditional gender, ethnicity and 
socio-economic barriers that might exist in society. 

Our businesses support people throughout their careers, both in the 
good times and when life experiences can be challenging. Tailored 
support at local level aims to help people struggling with issues around 
mental health, wellbeing and the cost of living. 

Advancement

Our businesses work to ensure that people who want to pursue a 
career in the food and hospitality industry can succeed with Compass. 

Compass encourages new joiners to make use of innovative tools such 
as digital onboarding applications and training programmes. A more 
accessible and flexible learning portfolio makes it easier for our people 
to pursue their longer-term ambitions.

This year, more than 1,500 colleagues have signed up for the UK&I’s 
landmark training and development scheme, Compass Career 
Pathways, with over 50% of those who have completed the 
programme having moved or been promoted into a new role.

Reaching disadvantaged groups 

Examples of how Compass is reaching disadvantaged groups are 
as follows.

Compass Group UK&I launched a Social Partner career hub as part of 
its Mission to a Million Social Promise. The hub supports candidates 
who face barriers to entering the job market, including ex-offenders, 
people leaving care, the long-term unemployed and people with 
disabilities. In a new tailored recruitment process, the hub works with 
partner organisations to match candidates with job opportunities and 
internships within the business. Training in relation to autism has been 
provided to unit managers to understand the challenges candidates 
face and deliver a supportive, inclusive and personalised hiring process.

Ex-military personnel bring unique skill sets and insights to the 
business. Compass Group UK&I has an estimated 1,000 employees 
who are part of the Armed Forces community and has reiterated its 
support for the Armed Forces by re-signing the Armed Forces 
Covenant. The business holds the Gold Employer Recognition Scheme 
award and has expanded the pledges to include a policy supporting 
the redeployment of spouses of serving military personnel. In the US, 
Compass has a well-developed careers programme for military 
veterans, working with Hiring our Heroes and supported by VetNet, 
the company’s veteran employee network. In 2022, Compass 
Australia became a part of the Australian Prime Minister’s Veteran 
Employment Program, and provides military veterans and those 
transitioning from defence with extra support into new career 
pathways by providing a structured support and mentoring 
programme as well as training for leaders and managers. It also 
supports families of serving military personnel into sustainable and 
ongoing employment that fits in with deployment needs.

The Compass Group Foundation

The Compass Group Foundation (the Foundation)1 is an 
independent charity, launched in January 2023 and provides 
grants to non-profit organisations in the communities in which 
Compass’ businesses operate.

Funding is provided to increase access to job opportunities for 
disadvantaged groups, through training and experience in the 
food service and hospitality sector, to support equitable market 
access for smallholder farmers and entrepreneurs in the food 
supply chain, and by way of emergency response for urgent 
humanitarian support. 

The Foundation leverages the Group networks and employee 
volunteering, to make a difference for the community. In the 
last year, the Foundation supported 14 initiatives across 
eight countries.

One such organisation supported is Sai Swayam Society in 
India. Funding from the Foundation has enabled 240 young 
people from the speech and hearing-impaired community to 
attend training, delivered through sign language, and focused 
on hospitality, IT, life and soft skills, and helping to secure jobs. 

In Spain, the Foundation provided funding to Fundación 
Integra, supporting women who have been victims of domestic 
violence, to work towards a Kitchen Assistant certification 
through Compass Spain’s Woman’s Academy, with Compass 
volunteers providing training and tutoring to the women as they 
progress with the qualification.

In the UK, the Foundation has supported Compass’ key charity 
partner, FoodCycle, to train volunteers who help to tackle food 
poverty, loneliness and food waste. Employees from Compass 
UK&I volunteered to support the training and upskilling of the 
FoodCycle volunteer teams.

In February 2023, the Foundation made a donation to support 
people affected by the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria.

Our aim is for Compass to reflect the communities 
in which we operate and to give all employees 
equal opportunities to progress their careers. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) is a living 
imperative within the businesses, and everyone, 
from front line workers to the Group’s leadership, 
has a role to play in creating a supportive and 
caring environment for all.

Compass Group US is a long-time partner of Navigate, working with 
young people from underrepresented communities to become the 
future of the hospitality and food service workforce. This year, over 
50 Navigate internship programme graduates worked with the 
business. In addition, the business created partnerships with 
Historically Black Colleges & Universities to educate students on 
careers. The US team is active at members’ careers fairs for talent 
recruitment and has created a scholarship fund for black students at 
Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina.

As one of the country’s largest employers of Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander people, Compass Australia has an important role to 
play in reconciliation and closing the considerable opportunity gap 
between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-
Indigenous Australians. The business provides sustained career 
development through its accredited training and cultural awareness 
programmes and is a proud partner of the Clontarf Foundation, 
providing support, life skills and graduate employment prospects 
to young Aboriginal men. 

Compass Norway, in cooperation with the Norwegian Labour and 
Welfare Administration, has worked to support individuals struggling 
to find employment, by offering the opportunity to achieve a certificate 
of apprenticeship and Norwegian language skills.

Growing careers 

From entry level to leadership, Compass invests in its people to help 
them achieve their career ambitions and shape the expertise and 
passion that drives the businesses.

Around the world, Compass businesses run programmes that identify 
and nurture a diverse cohort of leaders from within their existing teams. 

In Asia, the Compass Japan Academy introduced a six-month long 
programme for 300 future managers and Compass Group India 
launched a new immersive Leadership Lab to support the career 
growth of new leaders. The Indian business also provided 40,000 
employees with additional training through a new digital app to 
support learning journeys and opened two new skills centres to enable 
in-person tuition and the development of key capabilities.

As part of their career development, employees in the US completed 
more than one million training sessions in the business’s Learning 
Management System.

Human rights activity

As a Group, we are committed to upholding human rights, always 
treating people fairly, with dignity and respect, and we expect our 
businesses’ suppliers to uphold these same high standards 
throughout the value chain. 

We recognise the importance and responsibility of respecting 
the human rights of all our employees within our own operations, 
those workers throughout our businesses’ supply chains and the 
communities in which our businesses operate. 

We approach human rights in the same way as we conduct our 
business activities: ethically and with integrity, as set out in our 
Code of Business Conduct (CBC) and Global Supplier Code of 
Conduct (SCOC), demonstrating our commitments and Compass’ 
Values in our actions and behaviours.

We are also guided by our Human Rights Policy (reviewed in 
September 2023), in which we set out our belief that everyone 
is entitled to basic rights and freedoms, whoever they are, and 
wherever they live.

In the past year, we have continued to make progress to increase 
awareness and deepen the knowledge and understanding of the 
principal human rights risks across the diverse and complex 
environments our businesses operate in. We have also taken the 
opportunity to improve and enhance the associated processes, 
procedures, systems, training and polices aimed at improving 
our performance in this area. 

From reinforcing and further expanding existing successful 
practices and tools (such as, the award-winning Ethical 
Recruitment process in our business in the Middle East, the 
Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) framework and Supplier 
Ethical Data Exchange (Sedex) implementation), to developing 
new bespoke Human Rights training such as Striving For a More 
Equitable World and launching our Third-Party Integrity Due 
Diligence process, our businesses have focused on those activities 
where they can make the greatest positive impact.

In the coming year, we will continue to build on our progress to 
date, concentrating our efforts and investment where we can make 
the biggest difference, and continuing to promote best practice 
across the Group’s businesses and their supply chains.

For more on our approach to human rights, including our 
Human Rights Policy and Modern Slavery Act Statement go to:  
www.compass-group.com/en/sustainability/people/human-rights-
and-ethical-trade

Apprenticeships are a hugely popular route to a successful career in 
Compass, alongside the more traditional graduate routes. The UK&I’s 
unique Forward with Marcus Wareing programme runs alongside a 
Level 4 Senior Culinary Chef or Level 5 Operations Departmental 
Manager apprenticeship standard, and partners with the Michelin-
starred chef, focusing on sustainability, diversity and leadership.

Respect

Our aim is for Compass to reflect the communities in which we operate 
and to give all employees equal opportunities to progress their 
careers. Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) is a living imperative 
within our businesses, and everyone, from front line workers to the 
Group’s leadership, has a role to play in creating a supportive and 
caring environment for all. 

In the UK&I, Compass has added Ability, an employee network 
supporting people with disabilities, to its four established networks: 
Women in Food, Within (promoting ethnic, religious and cultural 
diversity), Pride in Food (for members of the LGBTQ+ community and 
allies) and You Matter (supporting mental health and wellbeing). 
Activities recognising and celebrating awareness events such as 
Pride Month, Mental Health Awareness Week, Learning Disability 
Week and International Women’s Day run throughout the year. 

Strength in diversity

Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Policy sets out our approach to 
diversity, equity and inclusion. It applies to all Compass employees, 
including directors and officers and all our majority-owned businesses, 
including subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our aim is to ensure that all 
employees and job applicants are given equal opportunity and that our 
organisation is representative of the communities in which we operate; 
that each employee is respected and valued and able to give their best 
as a result. 

Having people from diverse backgrounds in Compass is a huge 
strength for our businesses. For example, Black History Month was 
re-imagined as Black Future Month focusing on black inclusion and 
was celebrated with a series of events across the UK business 
including support from Non-Executive Director Arlene Isaacs-Lowe, 
who held roundtables with colleagues from the UK, US, Türkiye and 
UAE businesses.

At Compass Group USA, over 17,000 people completed DE&I training, 
and their Be the Difference conference in July 2023 was attended by 
more than 2,000 colleagues where they discussed empowering front 
line talent, exploring neurodiversity and the importance of allyship. 

In Belgium, Compass was awarded a diversity accreditation from the 
Brussels Employment Minister, as an employer which recognises, 
respects and values differences in the workplace.

In Australia, Compass was ranked number one in the Indigenous 
Employment Index in 2022 and has introduced an Indigenous training 
programme leading to an accredited Cert III in hospitality, with a 97% 
success rate for completion and employment. 

With its embedded commitment to DE&I, Compass Canada has 
launched Stronger Together Compass, focusing on mental health and 
wellness through its Diversity and Inclusion Action Councils, to provide 
colleagues with a safe space for conversation, where they can access 
resources and support one another. 

In India, the business launched a new digital training module in the 
fight against sexual harassment with over 6,000 employees 
completing the training.

Reinforcing its commitment to inclusivity in all talent areas, in 
February 2023, Compass UK&I became a patron of the Multicultural 
Apprenticeship Alliance, which partnered with Chartwells to launch 
the first Junior Chef Academy in Wales.

Celebrating women chefs

For the last four years, Compass Group USA’s Women in Culinary 
(WiC) programme has addressed inequalities and opportunity gaps 
within the hospitality industry by supporting women chefs with 
dedicated training, leadership development programmes and 
advancement opportunities. WiC is driving cultural change as well as 
career growth, igniting executive allyship and fostering kind kitchens. 
This year’s WiC showcase event was held in Dallas and encompassed 
International Women’s Day. The event gave a platform to exceptional 
female chefs from across Compass Group US businesses, displaying 
and celebrating their amazing talents.

Engagement 

Nurturing our people throughout their career is important to us. 
We support the health and wellbeing of our people with programmes 
and initiatives designed to help them stay healthy, happy and 
secure because we care about the physical and mental wellbeing 
of our colleagues.

For the last four years, Compass Group USA’s Women 
in Culinary programme has addressed inequalities and 
opportunity gaps within the hospitality industry by 
supporting women chefs for dedicated training, 
leadership development programmes and 
advancement opportunities.

Compass Group USA has launched Health is Wealth, a programme 
focused on mental, physical, financial and nutritional health. More 
information on the Health is Wealth programme can be found on 
page 106. In the UK&I, Compass provides free, easily accessible 
digital healthcare services to employees, including an annual health 
check, digital GP, second medical opinion, mental health therapists 
and nutritional consultations.

In the UAE, Compass has established the People Happiness Forum, 
giving everyone in the business a right to have their voice heard, with a 
platform to share their opinions. The ideas from the forum helped the 
business to win Gold for best company to work with, best recruitment 
strategy and best career development programme in the Plan3Media, 
Employee Happiness Summit Awards for UAE-based companies. 

We recognise that household pressures can impact the wellbeing of 
our people. Compass Group USA and Compass UK&I help their people 
take better control of their financial commitments by enabling them to 
access their pay in advance of their normal payday, when they need it, 
as well as supporting healthy savings habits. Compass UK&I provides 
around 200,000 free meals for colleagues every week and enhanced 
its Helping Hands hardship fund, providing emergency support grants 
to employees. Whilst Compass India’s We Care fund also provides an 
emergency backstop for employees when they need help.

Compass in the community 

As well as supporting our people directly, our businesses create 
positive social impact by investing in, and contributing to, the local 
communities in which they operate.

In the US, Compass’ Foodworks business has launched its IGNITE 
programme, offering grants to minority and women-owned business 
enterprises throughout the country. Foodworks helps these 
businesses purchase new equipment, expand operations and 
achieve necessary certifications. 

Chartwells Higher Education in the US has launched an innovative 
Teaching Kitchens platform, with onsite culinary experts and 
registered dieticians to promote culinary and nutritional literacy. 
These events seek to foster culinary curiosity and encourage a 
sense of adventure. The Teaching Kitchens initiative helps improve 
productivity, creativity, morale and engagement with client 
wellness initiatives.

Compass’ businesses advocate at local, national, and international 
level to promote diversity, equity and inclusion across their operations, 
as well as through their business partners and suppliers. Compass 
Australia, is recognised as a leader in Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander engagement through positive impact partnerships, respect 
and recognition through advocacy of The Voice to Parliament, and 
co-designing training and employment pathways for Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander people.

Priorities for the year ahead

Talent development and career opportunities remain key and are 
important to those who work in our businesses. We will continue to 
build out the Compass Academy concept and enhance career 
pathways in our businesses, with a particular focus on culinary and 
leadership skills. 

Employee engagement remains important and local strategies will 
seek to enhance the employee experience whilst also extending care 
programmes for employees during challenging times. 

Funding of local initiatives by The Compass Group Foundation will 
enable greater community impact across our businesses and increase 
our reach and impact on the social agenda.

Global employee engagement  
survey results 

Listening to colleagues through employee engagement surveys, 
townhalls, community meetings, social platforms and maintaining 
close relationships with formal employee representative groups 
and unions, are some of the ways employees can have their say on 
topics that matter most to them and helps them contribute to our 
strategy and success. 

This year’s global engagement survey heard the voices of 140,000 
colleagues across 19 countries, with a 63% response rate (up from 
54% last year) indicating enhanced engagement overall. 

Overall engagement scores held steady at 4.0 despite significantly 
higher participation levels from countries which have traditionally 
seen lower engagement. Eight out of 10 respondents agreed that 
they were treated fairly and with respect, felt part of a caring and 
positive team and were confident in the leadership of the business.

Whilst there remains work to do on personal growth, we were 
pleased to see an overall improvement of 5% (to 70%) in respect of 
career prospects and opportunities. 

We were also pleased that overall engagement levels remained 
consistent despite the continued disruptive impact of external 
factors on our people’s lives and a decline in life satisfaction in 
general. We know that what matters most to our people is to feel 
valued and to be able to give their best. To ensure all our people 
feel part of our caring, winning culture, we must deliver on our 
commitments of Respect, Teamwork and Growth for everyone and 
continue in our mission to provide opportunities for all.

Our Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement, 
Ireena Vittal, hosted six roundtable sessions in the year with 
employees from 12 countries. These sessions provided insight into 
employee sentiment on topics ranging from culture and diversity to 
artificial intelligence, inflation, wellbeing and reward.

Purpose

Progress on our journey to address Scope 3 emissions

We have taken the next step on our journey to reach climate net zero by 2050 by partnering 
with leading climate management platform Planet FWD. It was a big step, enabling us to 
improve our methodology for measuring emissions and enhancing the quality of our data for 
the supply chain (Scope 3) which generates most of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Our total Scope 3 emissions for 2022 were calculated using data from our top four markets 
– the US, UK, France and Australia representing 78% of our global revenues – using a hybrid 
volume and spend approach, and extrapolated to our smaller markets. We particularly focused 
on increasing data quality for purchased goods, the most significant source of emissions. The 
project to transition from spend to volume took six months to complete which has necessitated 
the use of 2022 data for reporting this year. This improvement in data quality has resulted in 
more granular estimates of food-related emissions and lower emissions estimates for 2022.

There is more to do, but we are making great progress and tackling Scope 3 emissions will 
remain one of our top sustainability priorities.

Environmental leadership

Food waste

Reducing food waste is one of the greatest environmental challenges 
facing our sector and therefore one where we have the greatest 
potential to make a significant difference. Our culinary teams and 
front line staff are instrumental in tackling this challenge, employing 
a range of diverse food waste reduction technologies across their 
businesses. This year, we made food waste reduction our top priority. 
Our target was to adopt food waste tracking technology in 6,000 
locations and, with every region united in support, we achieved 
7,943 locations, proudly surpassing our 2023 target – which is 
linked to an element of the annual bonus plan of executive directors 
and senior management.

In 2022, we launched Waste Not 2.0 – our proprietary, tablet-based, 
online tracking tool for chefs – and have since rolled it out across 12 
countries in nine languages. Waste Not 2.0 enables kitchen teams to 
identify opportunities to minimise food waste beyond the usual trim, 
bones, core and peel waste. Using the tool’s analytics, managers can 
evaluate data, quantify, and report on the carbon footprint of kitchen 
waste, leveraging this information to reduce or avoid future wastage.

Our ability to demonstrate progress in reducing our 
carbon impact and food waste is helping us attract 
new clients, who rely on us as a trusted partner to 
help them achieve their sustainability goals.

Purpose

Our Planet Promise

Our Planet Promise encompasses our values as an ethical, sustainable 
and inclusive business, together with our ambition to have a positive 
impact on the world. As well as being the right thing to do, this mission 
is also key to our growth aspirations and our long-term success.

Our ability to demonstrate progress in reducing our carbon impact and 
food waste is helping us attract new clients, who rely on us as a trusted 
partner to help them achieve their sustainability goals. Together with 
Compass, clients and consumers in every market can navigate 
towards a less wasteful, healthier, plant-forward lifestyle.

In September, we hosted our inaugural Sustainability Deep Dive; 
a virtual event providing institutional investors, analysts and other key 
stakeholders with an opportunity to enhance their understanding of 
the Group’s sustainability strategy, climate net zero progress, and 
operational innovations towards a more sustainable future for all.

Our actions are guided by the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (UN SDGs), especially those where we can have 
the greatest impact: carbon reduction, food waste, animal welfare, 
a reduction in high-emission products, and care for the health and 
wellbeing of our people and consumers.

In a global market, it is inevitable that some regions and countries will 
move faster than others towards our pledge of climate net zero by 
2050. Compass UK&I is leading the industry and has committed to 
achieving climate net zero by 2030. The UK&I are working with 
external partners to support their strategy, such as leading 
University of Oxford expert, Professor Sir Charles Godfray FRS, who 
is supporting them to shape and deliver their climate ambitions. 

Data transparency is embedded in our philosophy and our Task Force 
on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report (see pages 
45 to 54) includes disclosure of our climate-related risks and 
opportunities for 2023. 

Investing in innovation

We are investing in technology to ensure decision making is supported 
by data-driven insights across all areas of our sustainability strategy. 
Our businesses are providing clients with dashboards to visualise 
progress across the ESG metrics that are important to them with 
data provided by tools such as Waste Not 2.0, our proprietary food 
waste tracking technology, and via Planet FWD, a leading climate 
management platform. We continue to make investments to support 
our own ambitious goals, including enhancing our management of 
supply chain risks using the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange 
(Sedex) platform.

In September 2022, the Group issued fixed-rate sustainable bonds  
of €500m (£434m) and £250m maturing in 2030 and 2032, 
respectively. The proceeds of the bonds have to be allocated to 
expenditure on Eligible Sustainable Projects in line with the Compass 
Group Sustainable Financing Framework during the three years 
before, and two years after, the date of issue.

enhanced analytics data
to enable Waste Not 2.0 to report the 
water and carbon impact of the food 
waste being generated at site level 

Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

  41

As a global leader in food service, Compass is uniquely positioned to 
raise awareness and make a positive impact on the reduction of food 
waste throughout the sector. Compass USA launched Stop Food 
Waste Day (SFWD) in 2017, and the event is now the largest annual 
global day of action in the fight against food waste. SFWD not only 
draws attention to the problem but also engages and educates 
colleagues in the sector by sharing practical, creative and impactful 
ways to change behaviour and stop food waste. It also brings together 
consumers, businesses, not-for-profit organisations and government 
entities and encourages them to tackle the problem on a global scale.

This year, SFWD reached people in over 70 different countries, as well 
as being celebrated by units in all of our operating markets. It included 
themed menus, consumer pledges, recipe videos, and the launch of 
the second Stop Food Waste Day online cookbook, which received 
impressive engagement, as evidenced by more than 16,000 reads 
and 68,000 impressions. The campaign resonated widely, reaching 
over 93 million people through a variety of media, and achieved 26 
million views on X (formerly known as Twitter) alone; whilst Compass 
Group USA generated further engagement by hosting a SWFD live 
session featuring renowned food waste experts and leaders.

Chefs across the Group are leading transformative sustainability 
efforts within the food industry from the bottom-up, and this year we 
held our first Global Culinary Forum, named Chefs Creating Change, 
which tackled the pivotal issue of food waste, and provided a platform 
for front line teams to come together, deepen their understanding of 
food waste reduction, and exchange expertise in areas such as 
procurement, inventory management, menu creation and the 
application of technology. This ground-breaking event, conducted 
across four time zones, engaged approximately 3,000 chefs in the 
largest ever gathering of Compass culinary experts worldwide.

Menu reformulation

Creating climate-friendly and healthy menus that appeal to consumers 
is key to driving forward our sustainability agenda. Our culinary 
experts, registered dieticians, operators and marketing teams across 
the Group work together to ensure they deliver what their clients and 
consumers desire. Drawing upon our exceptional culinary expertise, 
we stand at the forefront of the industry, capable of delivering 
delicious meals that harmoniously blend flavour and health benefits. 
As the regulatory landscape evolves, we continue to provide food that 
encourages healthier eating for our clients. 

Our recent Global Eating at Work survey revealed that 49% of our 
younger consumers are expressing a heightened demand for 
plant-based options. Our approach replaces high-impact proteins 
such as beef and lamb with chicken and sustainable fish. We 
incorporate minimally processed plant-based foods without 
compromising on flavour, use less red meat, and blend animal protein 
with vegetables. Additionally, we position climate-friendly dishes 
prominently on menus to normalise their consumption without 
explicitly labelling them as vegetarian or vegan.

We are proud to be a member of the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and by co-chairing the Positive 
Consumption action area we are donating our time to develop a 
behaviour change toolkit for the participating food service members. 
The project is driving food systems transformation by developing 
solutions that support healthy people on a healthy planet.

Our chefs are leveraging behavioural change strategies using nudging 
techniques to steer consumers towards healthier options. This gives 
us an invaluable opportunity to foster a broader acceptance of 
nutritious, sustainably-sourced and plant-forward, nutritious dishes.

Our behavioural change strategies include:

 – Choice architecture: strategically positioning health-focused menu 

options in prominent locations, ensuring they catch the eye of 
consumers first

 – Information: providing comprehensive ingredient and nutritional 

information, coupled with practical advice for making better dietary 
decisions. Our goal is to empower guests with the knowledge they 
need to make choices that align with their health objectives

 – Incentives: motivating consumers towards healthier choices, and 
offering incentives such as extra loyalty reward points for selecting 
menu items that promote wellbeing

 – Emotional appeals: reinforcing positive choices by communicating 
monthly updates on the increased consumption of plant-based 
proteins or reduced red meat. This helps foster a collective goal of 
healthier eating

 – Social influence: leveraging the impact of social behaviour, tracking 
and communicating instances where consumers appreciate and 
choose new health-conscious options. This showcases their 
popularity and desirability, influencing individual selections

Our culinary experts strategically blend various levers for enhanced 
impact. For example, by combining choice architecture with financial 
incentives in a US manufacturing plant, the business was able to shift 
total purchases of healthy options from less than 30% to more than 
45%, and nudged beverage selection to 92% ‘better for you’ options.

Supplier initiatives

Close collaboration with suppliers is essential on our journey to climate 
net zero, because we know this goal cannot be achieved in isolation. 
We are actively leveraging our scale as a significant buyer of food in 
our ongoing drive towards decarbonisation, and see great potential for 
progress in working towards this shared goal with our partners.

For example, since January 2023, Compass UK&I has mandated that 
all new contracts require suppliers to set Science-Based Targets 
(SBTs) within 12 months of a contractual start date. This is 
supplemented with relevant KPIs related to sourcing, packaging and 
water consumption. By integrating multiple aspects of sustainability 
into their tendering process, our UK&I business has emphasised its 
dedication to sustainable procurement while meeting rapidly evolving 
industry requirements.

In May, the first Future Forward meeting was held in the US by our US 
businesses’ procurement arm, Foodbuy. This enabled Compass 
Group USA and their Foodbuy leaders to collaborate with some of their 
supplier partners on the future of sustainability within the food supply 
chain. Presentations were made by major suppliers setting out 
strategies to reduce GHG emissions from the farm level right through 
to the packaging and distribution of the finished product. Several 
Foodbuy member representatives attended, offering valuable insights 
from an operational standpoint.

During the year, over 450 suppliers, clients and colleagues attended 
the Foodbuy Conference 2023 at ExCeL London, a full-day event with 
a strong focus on sustainability, culminating in a gala awards dinner. 
The conference offered attendees an exclusive insight into the 
journey Foodbuy UK is on as a business, and what it has planned 
for the year ahead.

In the US, 300 people attended the Foodbuy US summit in Nashville, 
Tennessee, including the Compass US and Foodbuy leadership team 
and many of their major suppliers. There was a strong emphasis on 
sustainability throughout the presentations, which included an 
address from our Global Director of Sustainability.

Carbon reduction

Most of Compass Group’s GHG emissions are Scope 3, for which we 
are indirectly responsible. Our work with Planet FWD, a leading carbon 
management consultancy specialising in the food and agriculture 
industry, on measuring our Scope 3 emissions for 2022 (see page 38) 
is giving us valuable information which better enables us to work 
with suppliers to reduce the emissions of the Group’s products 
and services.

42 

Strategic report

Purpose continued

Our purchased goods emissions (Scope 3, category 1) decreased 
significantly against our 2019 baseline, as we evolved our approach 
from spend-based assessments to volume-based assessments. This 
is an important step which allows us to identify and take action on 
emissions reductions with greater accuracy than with a spend-based 
approach. Improving data accuracy to report Scope 3 emissions was a 
six month process, resulting in 2022 emissions reported in this year. 
However, our 2019 assessment had underestimated energy usage in 
client kitchens, which have subsequently increased in 2022, offsetting 
emissions reductions achieved in purchased goods, resulting in an 
overall emissions decrease of 12%.

The Group has targeted a 28% reduction in our absolute Scope 3 GHG 
emissions from all purchased food and drink by 2030, from a base 
year of 2019 - a goal approved by the SBTi. We will deliver this by 
focusing on food waste reduction, training our teams, reformulating 
our menus and working closely with our suppliers to explore new 
sustainable business practices. Moving to a volume-based approach 
and further developing our understanding of granular estimates of 
food-related emissions will help us achieve our target, with a reduction 
in emissions coming from product mix and sourcing opportunities. 
We are also working to align with the new Forest, Land and Agriculture 
(FLAG) guidance under the SBTi in 2024.

The next phase of our journey with Planet FWD is to utilise its 
industry-leading technology to manage our data when reporting 
emissions across our largest markets, to enable greater collaboration 
with clients in support of carbon-reduction initiatives. We are also 
investing in technology to influence consumer behaviour at the point 
of purchase, through carbon labelling with market-leading providers 
such as Foodsteps and HowGood. Carbon labelling scores food on 
whether it has a higher or lower environmental impact, based on the 
total GHG emissions generated from the extraction of raw materials to 
end of life.

Methodology

Compass Group PLC is required to report its global and UK energy use 
and carbon emissions in accordance with the Companies (Directors’ 
Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) 
Regulations 2018. The data reported in these tables represent emissions 
and energy use for which Compass Group PLC is responsible and is 
incorporated by reference in the Directors’ report on pages 56 to 130. 
To calculate our Group emissions, we have used the main 
requirements of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard along with the 
UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2023.

We monitor the energy usage and GHG emissions of our owned and 
operated sites across 28 countries (2022: 29), which represent 98% 
of the Group’s underlying revenue (2022: 98%). tCO2e per £ million 

turnover is calculated by dividing our total gross emissions (location 
based) by underlying revenue2 for the countries monitored.

Our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions have been externally verified by a 
third-party, and we will continue to verify this data in the coming years.

See more at www.compass-group.com/en/sustainability/ 
performance-and-reports.html

Our absolute emissions have increased year-on-year as Compass 
continued to successfully win new business across all regions, and, 
by the end of the year, revenues grew significantly. However, we are 
still making good progress in delivering our commitments and have 
already reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 10% compared with 
a 2019 baseline. When normalised by revenue we have seen a 12% 
year-on-year reduction in our GHG emissions ratio. Our UK emissions 
have fallen as a result of a robust set of actions to deliver carbon 
reduction initiatives, including the implementation of renewable 
electricity and energy efficiency solutions across our direct operations. 

Energy efficiency

Across Europe, we continue to make good progress, led by Compass 
UK&I, which is continuing to implement its 100% electric vehicle 
policy. This year, Compass Spain has initiated projects including the 
installation of solar panels at their head office site and is also 
transitioning its fleet to electric vehicles.

In the US, SCS Global Services have certified Canteen’s largest 
Californian branch as carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
marking a major step towards Canteen’s commitment to achieving 
climate net zero by 2030. The branch team achieved this goal by 
completing a comprehensive GHG inventory of their operations, 
identifying emission hotspots and reduction targets, introducing 
electric delivery trucks to reduce emissions, improving energy 
efficiency, reducing overall waste, and investing in credible carbon 
mitigation projects to offset the remainder of its emissions.

Reusable solutions

Compass is contributing towards building a more circular economy, in 
which materials can be reused or recirculated to keep them in use as 
long as possible and to minimise waste. In Europe, for example, our 
businesses are reducing the use of unnecessary single-use plastic to 
a level below that required by the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive. 
Reducing unnecessary single-use plastics at scale can help drive 
behavioural change in employees and clients, which we hope they 
will carry into other areas of their work and home lives.

Reducing single-use materials, specifically unnecessary plastic, is an 
industry-wide challenge that requires collaboration across the value 
chain. In response to this challenge, Compass USA co-founded the 
Single-Use Materials Decelerator (SUM’d), a non-profit, cross-sector 
group of NGOs and technical experts working to reduce reliance on 
single-use materials in the food industry. Together, they built the 
Understanding Packaging Scorecard, a simple, free tool to assess 
the sustainability impact of common food-service packages. 

To learn more, read the SUM’d case study at  
www.upscorecard.org/compass-case-study/

Current sustainable plastics initiatives include:

 – the launch of Google’s Single-Use Plastics Challenge in partnership 

with Canteen in the US. The challenge invites food companies 
which offer packaging that is free of single-use plastic to test their 
solutions in Google’s US cafes and micro kitchens. Challenge 
finalists will have the opportunity to pitch to Google and Canteen to 
scale across Google’s US offices

 – the deployment of reusable cutlery within Compass Saudi Arabia’s 
healthcare business has successfully eliminated approximately 
460,000 packets of single-use cutlery annually

 – the installation of 180 water fountains in more than 80 business 
units across Compass Spain, offering a sustainable alternative to 
single-use plastic bottles of water. This is already saving 3.9 million 
containers a year and avoiding 87.7 tonnes CO2e

 – operating a zero-waste soccer stadium in partnership with Levy 
Restaurants in the US, eliminating single-use consumer plastics
 – the introduction of a returnable, reusable solution to disposable 
packaging, CauliBox, which launched with a Compass UK&I 
Restaurant Associate site. Since October 2021, more than 33,000 
CauliBoxes have been used, and the total emissions saved is now 
approaching 8,000kg CO2e. Customers manage their CauliBox via 
an app, which monitors when they borrow and return a container 
and allows them to build up CauliCoin rewards with bespoke 
promotional codes. The initiative has helped the restaurant 
switch the salad bar to reusables only, further driving positive 
behavioural change

 – a sustainable cup solution for events, introduced by Levy in the UK. 
A 10 pence micro deposit is linked to a charity partner for donations. 
The cup retention rate during the 2022-2023 sports season was a 
remarkable 95.6%, resulting in a CO2e reduction of 7,400kg

 – switching to Ozzi 100% reusable Tupperware across Chartwells in 
the US, a major step in Compass USA’s initiative to significantly 
increase the adoption of reusable containers. Since the last 
financial year they have so far changed 97% of their containers, 
marking an almost complete switch to reusables

Positive procurement

Procurement teams are focused on several initiatives to make a 
positive impact on the planet and the communities that our 
businesses are part of. Sourcing local products, building an inclusive 
and diverse supplier base, supporting regenerative agriculture, 
demanding high animal welfare standards, protecting human rights 
and promoting ethical trade, are key strategic imperatives which drive 
the bottom line whilst enhancing our brands. These initiatives together 
with our animal welfare and palm oil commitments also drive impact 
beyond our business.

Purpose continued

Animal welfare

We are committed to upholding the Five Freedoms of animal welfare: 
freedom from hunger and thirst; from pain, injury and disease; from 
fear and distress; from discomfort; and freedom to express normal 
behaviour. Our businesses track animal welfare in every country we 
operate in, and work with their supply partners to make progress and 
address challenges. As a founding member of the Global Coalition for 
Animal Welfare (GCAW), we are working pre-competitively with other 
leading international food companies. Together, we collectively 
address systemic barriers to change, share best practices and make 
progress on key animal welfare issues at a faster pace than would 
otherwise be possible. In 2023, GCAW’s focus has been on improving 
welfare for laying hens, broiler chickens and pigs. Compass’ global 
footprint means our businesses face unique regional and local 
challenges. To better understand and overcome these we engage 
closely with several global, regional, and country-focused NGOs. 
These partnerships have proved valuable in helping drive 
welfare standards. 

Diverse, equitable and inclusive supplier base

We are working collaboratively with clients, suppliers and other third 
parties to continue building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive 
supplier base. In the year under review, we started to collect more 
data from our operating companies to help us identify opportunities 
to increase our impact. We have partnered with: Minority Supplier 
Development UK, which champion ethnic-minority-owned businesses 
in the UK; WeConnect, which amplifies the presence of female 
business owners and helps them compete in the global marketplace, 
and; in the US, with Disability:In, the leading non-profit resource for 
business disability inclusion. All three organisations are helping us to 
further identify and support diverse suppliers. In the US the Foodbuy 
Diverse Supplier Accelerator Program, now in its third year, was 
created to offer a broad range of services and resources to assist the 
growth of diverse suppliers. This initiative focuses on 10 new women 
and minority-owned businesses each year, providing them with 
mentors, education sessions, and industry connection opportunities. 

Sustainable and ethical supply chain

Led by the Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Committee, 
over the past year we have continued to strengthen our approach 
to identifying and mitigating business integrity, human rights, and 
environmental risks in our supply chains. Given the size and 
complexity of the Group’s businesses and their supply chains, a 
risk-based approach is taken and we continue to invest in education, 
awareness, technology, partnerships, and training to ensure due 
diligence processes continue to evolve. 

The Group’s Global Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC), launched in 
2022, is an essential part of the contractual requirements for all 
suppliers. It sets out the principles, expectations and behaviours we 
require our supply chain partners to adhere to in areas of business 
integrity and ethical principles, human rights and labour standards, 
health and safety, and sustainability. 

Sedex has now been adopted by 14 countries (including all top 10 
markets by revenue), providing data on ethical practices for supplier 
sites in 54 countries. We have also introduced a new Third-Party 
Integrity Due Diligence process, piloted in 10 countries. We have 
continued our partnerships with Earthworm Foundation and 
Slave-Free Alliance, whilst our US business continues to support 
the Coalition of Immokalee Workers’ Fair Food Program. Learnings 
gained through these partnerships have been shared internally and 
with suppliers to expand understanding and increase our impact. 
Our Human Rights Working Group has been a powerful forum for 
sharing best practice throughout our regions. See page 35 for 
more information.

Community impact

We want to take care of the communities where our businesses 
are based in ways that make a real difference to each individual 
community. Locally-made investments have substantially benefited 
many local food producers and small-scale ventures that have 
partnered with Compass because they share our values. Our 
businesses use their skills and resources to provide donations of food 
where it is most needed, support charity projects that can change 
lives, and advocate for social enterprises that seek to make lasting 
change for the better.

Food donations

Donating good-quality food, that would otherwise go to waste to those 
in need is not only sustainable, it is the right thing to do. Compass 
businesses work with food recovery partners in all our markets to 
make sure good food reaches people in food poverty. They donate 
where they can have the greatest impact, from supporting local 
community food banks and food pantries to participating in child meal 
programmes. During the year, Compass businesses donated over 
1.6 million meals to their local communities. 

Food Fleet is a dynamic mobile food provider and management 
company in our North America business, in Hawaii. During the year, 
Food Fleet worked closely with the Wave Foundation and We Do 
Better Relief alongside suppliers, vendors and chefs to deliver 
essential assistance to the Maui community, which was severely 
affected by wildfires on the island.

Social enterprises

One of our US businesses, Wolfgang Puck Catering, actively 
collaborates with a range of small-scale ventures and food producers 
that work to foster positive social change. One such enterprise is 
Scott Family Farms, a third-generation family business, which aims 
to mentor black farmers and reshape farming for black communities. 
Wolfgang Puck Catering also collaborates with Homeboy Industries 
in East Los Angeles, the world’s largest gang intervention and 
rehabilitation programme, providing resources to help rebuild the 
lives of former gang members.

Another US community venture, Foodworks, has introduced its 
IGNITE programme; a community initiative, which provides grants to 
minority and women-owned businesses across the US. Foodworks 
offers small business coaching, quality assurance training, marketing 
assistance and extensive exposure to partners nationwide to facilitate 
the rapid expansion of local restaurants.

The Compass Group Foundation

In the UK, The Compass Group Foundation supports the charity 
FoodCycle, which runs a network of community kitchens, using 
surplus produce which would otherwise go to waste. 

In Australia, Compass Group has partnered with Foodbuy Australia as 
well as Bridging the Gap Foundation (founded by Menzies School of 
Health and Science Research), which has been granted seed funding 
by the Foundation to pilot a Nutritional Hunger Program (NHP).

The NHP aims to end nutritional hunger in remote Indigenous 
communities by co-designing a programme with local Indigenous 
community leaders to find solutions to get high-quality, nutritious 
food to Indigenous communities at reasonable prices. Training and 
education will also be provided to various community groups and 
members, including store owners, in areas of food production, 
sanitisation, cooking, inventory management and healthy choices 
for better health outcomes. See page 33 for more information 
about the Foundation.

Task Force on 
Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD)

We set out below our climate-related financial disclosures, 
which are consistent with the four pillars and 11 recommended 
disclosures of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, 
including the TCFD all-sector guidance, and in compliance with the 
requirements of LR 9.8.6R.(8) (UK Listing Rules).

This disclosure also complies with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 as amended by the Companies (Strategic 
Report) (Climate-related Financial Disclosure) Regulations 2022.

Executive summary

Without coordinated action, climate change poses a significant risk 
to our planet, people and economies. For the global food system, on 
which we all rely, rising global temperatures, water stress and extreme 
weather events can disrupt supply chains, reduce crop yields and 
damage community livelihoods. However, for those who drive 
innovation and take a leadership position on sustainability, there are 
also significant opportunities.

As a Group, we are proud of the work we are doing in partnership with 
our clients to support our shared climate goals. Sustainability is 
intrinsic to the way we conduct business and our long-term success, 
while also being deeply ingrained in our culture, from our chefs to our 
executive leadership.

We have many tried-and-tested operational levers at our disposal to help 
mitigate supply chain disruptions resulting from climate change, through 
our procurement scale, sourcing flexibility, menu management and 
culinary and digital innovation. There is no single solution to this global 
challenge, and we are making many incremental changes across 
thousands of our units and throughout our businesses’ supply chains.

To tackle climate change, it is vital that we measure, track and understand 
how climate change impacts our operations, our clients and our strategy. 
The purpose of this TCFD statement is to provide investors and wider 
stakeholders with a better understanding of our exposure and strategic 
resilience to climate-related risks, and to enable us to identify climate-
related opportunities that are material to the Group. We consider all risks 
and opportunities evaluated in this statement to be industry-wide, applying 
to each of our sectors, our competitors and other key stakeholders.

Our analysis comprises three climate scenarios (1.5°C, 2.5°C and 4°C) 
for which we have considered physical risks, transition risks and related 
opportunities. This year, our third year of disclosure, we have materially 
expanded the scope of our scenario analysis in four key areas:

 – in addition to risks, climate-related opportunities have also been 

examined this year

 – the Geographic Scope has increased from the US in 2022 to now cover 
four of our largest markets (the US, UK, Australia and France), which 
together represent over three-quarters of the Group’s underlying revenue

 – the Product Scope has expanded from six in 2022 to seven of our 
most significant product categories (adding beverages this year), 
which together represent over 60% of our total MAP 3 food spend in 
the four in-scope markets

Sustainability is intrinsic to the way we conduct 
business and our long-term success, while also 
being deeply ingrained in our culture, from our 
chefs to our executive leadership.

46 

Strategic report

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures continued

 – we have considered three time horizons in our scenario analysis this year 

 – The Board has overall responsibility for oversight of the 

(short, medium and long-term), enabling greater depth of analysis 
compared to 2022 where only the medium-term was considered

We also included a broader range of internal and external 
stakeholders in our scenario analysis, including external climate 
resilience experts. This enhanced engagement identified four specific 
risks as the most relevant physical climate-related risks, and these 
were the focus of our quantitative scenario analysis.

Based on our modelling this year, the most significant financial impact, 
whilst still moderate, arises from chronic water stress in the US and 
Australia in 2050, with beef and dairy production likely to be most 
impacted by climate change. These findings are consistent with our 
strategy to build competitive sourcing programmes in alternative food 
categories such as meatless proteins, and to nudge consumers towards 
diets that are more planet-friendly. Consequently, we are confident in 
our ability to mitigate the impact of this risk.

Last year we modelled transition risks, which identified carbon taxation 
in the US (in a low-carbon scenario) as the most significant potential 
impact. We believe this conclusion continues to be relevant this year 
and we remain confident in our ability to manage the financial risk 
under this scenario, with the net impact expected to be immaterial. 

We are dedicating significant resources to acquiring and 
implementing cutting-edge technologies to enhance our sustainability 
services for clients and to maximise the opportunities that we 
anticipate will arise from the climate transition. This includes strategic 
investment in our monitoring and measurement capabilities, which 
enable our businesses to offer in-depth and tailored roadmaps for 
their clients, while positioning the Group as a trusted partner in 
helping them achieve their own sustainability goals.

Furthermore, we recognise the important role we can play – through 
direct engagement and close collaboration with our businesses’ 
supply chain partners – in creating a low-carbon supply chain that is 
fit for the future. In 2023, this was a focus area during the Future 
Forward day that we hosted with key suppliers to our businesses in the 
US. In the UK, it is now a requirement for all suppliers to set their own 
science-based targets, in line with Compass’ own commitments. This 
is also extensively discussed in the supplier conferences that our 
various markets host each year.

Despite significantly expanding our analysis this year, we recognise 
that scenario analysis is limited by the availability of data on the 
long-term impacts of climate change, and our disclosures will need to 
evolve as data availability improves. We are committed to working with 
experts to continue to review the scope of our analysis and evolve our 
process in future years. 

The analysis shown in this disclosure was completed in 2023, with the 
exception of the quantitative scenario analysis on carbon taxation, 
which was completed in 2022. The qualitative and quantitative 
scenario analysis will be repeated at a minimum every three years in 
line with the relevant regulations. 

Governance

Oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities

Compass has well-established governance structures designed to 
effectively oversee the management of its principal risks, including 
climate change risks and opportunities. Principal risks are reviewed 
biannually by the Board. Climate change is a principal risk and it was 
embedded into our risk management processes in 2021 (see page 26).

Climate-related risks and opportunities are overseen and managed at 
the highest levels of the Company through the following governance 
structures and processes:

management of climate-related risks and opportunities, which it 
exercises through the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Committee and 
the Audit Committee

 – The Corporate Responsibility Committee meets at least three times 
a year and comprises all the Non-Executive Directors of the Board, 
together with the Chair of the Board, Group Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO) and Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO). It receives reports at 
every meeting from the Group Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), the 
Global Director of Sustainability and other senior managers to 
ensure that progress is being made towards meeting the Group’s 
specific CR KPIs and ongoing CR commitments, including 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and food waste reduction targets

 – The Audit Committee meets at least three times a year and 

comprises all the independent Non-Executive Directors of the Board. 
In line with the governance process used for financial management, 
it considers the potential impact of climate change on the financial 
statements, including the output of the Group’s scenario analysis, the 
costs to achieve the Group’s climate net zero commitments, and their 
impact on the financial statements and related disclosures

 – Executive sponsorship is shared jointly between the Group CEO and 
Group CCO, who have the highest management-level responsibility 
to form, review and communicate the Company’s climate-related 
global strategy, policies and standards. This includes setting and 
reviewing progress towards targeted KPIs, assessing climate-related 
risks and managing and monitoring associated opportunities

 – They are supported at an operational level by the Global Director of 
Sustainability, who leads the Group Sustainability function. This 
function provides support to the Group’s regions and countries to 
ensure sustainability strategies are implemented and climate-
related risks and corresponding controls and mitigations are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis

 – At Executive Committee level, the Regional Managing Directors 
(RMDs) are responsible for managing climate-related risks and 
opportunities for their respective regions. At a country level, the 
country Managing Directors are responsible for managing 
climate-related risks and opportunities in their respective countries

Strategy

Climate-related risks and opportunities and their impact on 
the operations of the Group

Our specialist internal teams partnered with external climate 
resilience experts to conduct qualitative and quantitative risk 
assessments and scenario analysis to identify climate-related risks 
and opportunities.

In 2022, we published the results of our scenario analysis, which 
showed that Compass is well placed to respond to transition risks and 
market pressures through our dynamic operational and strategic 
levers. This year, we expanded our assessment to align with the latest 
guidance from the 2021 TCFD Annex. We also conducted a deeper 
analysis to understand our exposure to physical climate-related risks 
and opportunities across four key geographies (details of which can be 
found in the Scope section on page 48).

At Compass, we are aware that some of our markets are already 
experiencing the physical impacts of climate change. We want to 
ensure that our strategy is resilient and set up to deliver on our Planet 
Promise of a sustainable future for all. This commitment encompasses 
the Company’s values as an ethical, sustainable and inclusive 
business, and is key to our growth aspirations. 

We are committed to reaching climate net zero by 2050, supported 
by our Sustainable Financing Framework, and we have plans in place 
to mitigate and adapt to climate-related risks and a future climate 
transition. We are also making strategic investments which will 
enable the Group and its businesses to capitalise on climate-related 
opportunities, including investing in state-of-the-art technology to help 
our clients realise their sustainability goals effectively and efficiently. 

Scenario analysis

In 2022, we analysed two low-emission scenarios and one high-
emission scenario to understand the physical and transition risks and 
opportunities of climate change. This year, to understand the physical 
risks and opportunities in greater depth, we have chosen 2.5°C and 
4°C scenarios to model chronic and acute physical risks and 
opportunities. A separate 1.5°C scenario allows us to focus on the 
impact of transition risks and opportunities. 

These three climate scenarios, which are explained in more detail 
in the table below, were chosen by our specialist internal team, 
which includes representatives from the Sustainability, Finance, 
Commercial and Procurement functions, in consultation with our 
expert external partners.

(SSP 2/ RCP 4.5 
combination)

Scenario C –

4°C by 2100

(SSP 5/ RCP 8.5 
combination)

The world takes rapid and drastic action to limit global warming 
and meet the ambition of the 2015 Paris Agreement:

 – coordinated action across public and private sectors
 – low-carbon technologies take over from fossil fuels
 – shift in consumer demand and preferences towards 

low-carbon products and services

The world follows a path in which social, economic and 
technological trends do not shift markedly from 
historical patterns:

 – development and income growth proceeds unevenly
 – middle-of-the-road emissions with inconsistent 

technological process

 – global and national institutions work towards, but make 

slow progress in, achieving the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals

The world continues to use fossil fuels as the engine of 
economic growth, resulting in worst-case levels of 
global warming:

 – severe and frequent extreme weather, with chronic 

changes to seasonal weather patterns

 – extensive business disruption, severely damaging 

economic growth

 – protectionist government policies to build resilience to 

climate change

A < 2°C scenario is required 
by TCFD. This scenario allows 
Compass to explore transition 
risks in key markets, consider 
changes in consumer and 
client preferences and 
understand competitor and 
stakeholder pressures. 

This scenario allows 
Compass to prepare for a 
disorderly transition away 
from fossil fuels. Under this 
2.5°C scenario, Compass 
examines both physical  
and transition risks 
and opportunities.

Increase in sourcing 
costs due to carbon 
pricing on agricultural 
(farm to farm gate) 
and freight emissions.

Increase in sourcing 
costs due to carbon 
pricing on agricultural 
(farm to farm gate) 
and freight emissions, 
and production losses 
leading to higher 
procurement costs.

This scenario allows 
Compass to assess the 
impact of acute and chronic 
physical climate-related 
risks and opportunities on 
the business, supply chain, 
supplier network, 
and stakeholders.

Loss in production 
leads to higher 
procurement costs 
due to the costs 
involved in switching 
sourcing. No carbon, 
plastic or food tax 
is assumed.

Scope and assumptions

Time horizon

We consider three time horizons – three years (short-term), four to 10 
years (medium-term) and greater than 10 years (long-term) – to be 
the relevant time horizons for our scenario analysis, with the 
assumption that climate-related issues often manifest themselves 
over the medium to long-term.

 – Short-term – three years is the period reviewed by the Board in its 
annual strategic planning process and is aligned to the typical 
length of the contracts in the Group’s businesses (three to five 
years). It is also consistent with the time period of the Group’s 
viability statement (see page 31).

 – Medium-term – this time horizon allows for the outcomes of 

scenario analysis to influence the development of our strategic 
objectives.

 – Long-term – analysis over this time horizon is more uncertain due 

to the limited availability of data on the long-term impacts of climate 
change, the severity of which will be contingent on the actions 
taken over the short and medium-term.

Geographic and Product Scopes

To understand the impacts of physical and transition risks and 
opportunities in greater depth, the scope of the scenario analysis 
was expanded this year to include consideration of four countries 
(2022: 1) and seven product categories (2022: 6). Our business 
model in all sectors is very similar, hence we do not believe there 
would be any material differences in the outcomes if we considered 
different sectors in this exercise.

The Geographic Scope of the expanded scenario analysis was 
determined on the basis of both materiality (with the US, UK, Australia 
and France representing 78% of the Group’s underlying revenue in 
2023) and reach (with each of our reporting regions – North America, 
Europe and Rest of World – represented in the analysis). The balance 
of our underlying revenue comprises multiple countries, with no 
individual country representing more than 4% of the Group’s total 
underlying revenue in the year.

The product focus for the scenario analysis was protein (beef, pork, 
poultry and dairy), produce (fruit and vegetables) and in addition, this 
year, beverages. Together, these products represent more than 60% 
of the total MAP 3 food spend in 2023 in the four in-scope countries.

Qualitative scenario analysis

Building on the work conducted in 2022, a long-list of climate-related 
risks and opportunities was identified using the climate scenarios 
mentioned above. Their impacts on the business were discussed with 
business leaders and management across the markets in scope for 
the assessment. Workshops with our specialist internal teams, market 
representatives, Group senior management and external climate 
resilience experts were held to qualitatively assess each climate-
related risk and opportunity to determine the possible operational and 
financial impacts. Participants included representatives from the 
Sustainability, Finance, Commercial and Procurement functions. The 
likelihood and impact of the risks were ranked to determine a list of 
relevant transition and physical climate-related risks and opportunities.

The process of understanding our risk exposure and impact has been 
incremental. This year’s in-depth analysis of physical risks has 
provided Compass with granular insight into how the impact of 
climate-related risks and opportunities varies across specific 
geographies in each time horizon.

The table on pages 49 and 50 summarises the climate-related risks 
and opportunities identified during the qualitative scenario analysis 
and, for each one, shows the potential impact, geographical exposure 
and time horizon during which the impact is expected to materialise. 
Climate-related risks and opportunities are continuously reviewed 
together with other business risks as part of our biannual Major Risk 
Assessment (MRA) process. Climate-related risks and opportunities 
are assessed based on their potential impact on profit before interest 
and tax (PBIT) in accordance with the criteria set out in the Board-
approved Risk Management Policy (see page 26).

The table also highlights for each risk the combination of strategic 
business model levers and operational measures available to the 
Group to mitigate the impact of the risks and to seize the opportunities 
identified. Many of these levers and operational measures are ones we 
regularly deploy and, based on our experience, will allow us to mitigate 
the impacts to levels deemed minor or negligible.

The chronic risks were only modelled for the US and Australia on the 
basis that only these countries are expected to experience temperature 
increases at levels that will impact livestock and milk production.

Last year, in addition to physical risks, we also modelled transition 
risks relating to taxation. As we consider that the conclusions of that 
analysis remain relevant this year, they have not been re-modelled. 

The food products selected for the quantitative scenario analysis 
remain consistent with last year, with protein (beef, dairy, poultry 
and pork) and produce (fruit and vegetables) continuing to be the 
focus of our modelling.

The table below shows the results of this year’s quantitative scenario 
analysis in respect of physical risks, together with last year’s 
low-carbon transition scenario. We are confident that our strategic 
business model levers and operational measures will allow us to 
mitigate the impacts to levels deemed minor or negligible.

Quantitative scenario analysis

Each of the risks and opportunities identified during the qualitative 
scenario analysis was considered for quantification based on the level 
of risk identified, its likelihood and the additional insight that would be 
gained from quantification.

We continue to enhance our risk management and climate change 
decision-making processes and, consistent with the qualitative 
scenario analysis, have extended our modelling to short, medium and 
long-term timeframes (2025, 2030 and 2050) and four countries (US, 
UK, Australia and France). Last year, only one timeframe (2030) and 
one country (US) were considered.

This year, we have focused our analysis on the four most relevant 
physical climate risks identified during the qualitative scenario 
analysis: acute drought and heat events, and chronic water stress 
and temperature increases. These have been modelled under 
the three climate scenarios, A, B and C, explained on page 47, 
across the relevant markets and each of the short, medium and 
long-term timeframes.

4  The four specific risks identified by the Group as the most relevant physical climate-related risks.

Key assumptions

 – it is assumed that the price elasticity of food products is 100%, 
i.e. when the yield decreases by 1, the price increases by 1
 – it is assumed that the price elasticity of poultry and pork feed 
is 50%, i.e. when the price of feed increases by 1, the price of 
poultry and pork increases by 0.5

 – the output of the analysis is an estimated cost increase assuming 
no volume changes from 2022 levels and no changes in business 
activities. The results refer to this scope only and, as such, cannot 
be extrapolated

 – the analysis does not include the mitigation or adaptation measures 

that would be undertaken by the Group’s businesses and their 
suppliers to offset the estimated cost increases

52 

Strategic report

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures continued

Consistent with last year, no potential financial impacts in 2030 of 
2.5% or more of total spend on in-scope food categories before 
business levers were identified in respect of the physical climate 
risks modelled.

This year’s modelling of physical risks shows that the most significant 
potential impact is from chronic water stress in the US and Australia in 
2050 under all three climate scenarios, with an estimated annual cost 
increase in the range of 2.5% to 5.0% of the total spend on in-scope 
food categories across the US, UK, Australia and France. The analysis 
shows that beef and dairy production is likely to be most impacted by 
climate change, with costs increasing in the long-term. However, our 
existing strategy, informed by a focus on potential climate impacts, is 
building competitive sourcing programmes in alternative food 
categories including meatless proteins and dairy alternatives, such 
that the impact of this risk can be successfully mitigated by the Group. 

The most significant potential impact identified during our quantitative 
scenario analysis last year was from the transition risk of carbon 
taxes on animal protein in the US in 2030 under low-carbon climate 
Scenario A, with an estimated annual cost increase in a range of 
5.0% to 7.5%. Whilst we concluded that the application of the 
business levers at hand in our operational model would substantially 
reduce the financial impact, the analysis showed that carbon tax on 
our Scope 3 GHG emissions is a key risk to mitigate and, therefore, 
it is the focus of our current efforts, which are highlighted in the 
Metrics and targets section below.

Future roadmap on scenario analysis

We will continue to evolve our scenario analysis for future TCFD 
disclosures. In 2024, we expect to quantify an opportunity while 
continuing to expand our analysis into more geographies and 
product categories.

The resilience of the Group strategy

Compass Group’s sustainability leadership, climate net zero roadmap 
and well-established plant-forward strategy make us more resilient 
and adaptable than many of our peers to the impacts of climate 
change, most notably evolving client and consumer demands and 
the projected climate impacts on animal protein production costs 
and availability.

The Group benefits from a wide range of strategic and operational 
processes already in place that can be flexed to address changing 
market dynamics, supply disruption and other impacts of climate 
change. These processes include a combination of operational 
mitigation measures and strategic business model levers, captured in 
the table on page 49 and 50. The main levers available to Compass 
are flexible menu arrangements with clients, food waste management 
to optimise resource efficiency, and continued strategic diversification 
of suppliers and sourcing regions. Compass already widely deploys 
these levers as part of our normal business practices, and we are 
confident they will continue to provide a competitive advantage during 
any climate transition.

Beyond these business levers, we are also evolving our approach to 
carbon. Most of Compass Group’s GHG emissions are Scope 3. 
Collaboration with our suppliers is essential as we recognise that we 
cannot impact those emissions on our own. We are working with 
partners like Planet FWD (see page 38), and we are moving to a 
volume-based data approach, to build a more granular understanding 
of food-related emissions.

Working with our suppliers on reducing their carbon emissions, 
combined with menu engineering and reducing food waste, form 
the three key levers to our carbon reduction strategy.

We believe our business model will be resilient in all three climate 
change scenarios that were considered during the process. 

Risk management

Processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks

Climate change has been assessed as a principal risk by the Board 
since 2021, recognising the potential impacts it can have on our 
businesses in the medium and long-term. Climate change risks and 
opportunities are considered as part of our MRA process: a structured 
biannual bottom-up and top-down risk review completed by all 
countries, which is the cornerstone of our risk management framework.

The process for identifying climate-related risks and opportunities is 
consistent with last year and continues to involve both country 
leadership teams and central functions, including Finance, Risk 
Management, Legal and Sustainability. Risks are identified and 
assessed within each country and region, and the Group risks are 
assessed biannually by the Board.

In accordance with our risk management framework, we assess the 
materiality of key risks and opportunities, including climate-related 
risks and opportunities, and deem them to have a substantive 
financial or strategic impact if there is a one-off or recurring annual 
profit impact of more than 4% of our PBIT. More information about our 
risk management framework can be found on pages 24 and 25.

Processes for managing climate-related risks

As noted on pages 26 to 30, the Group’s principal risks (which include 
climate-related risks) are all considered as part of the Group’s 
strategic planning process and viability statement assessment. 
In addition, we note on page 151 how climate risk has been 
considered in the basis of preparation of the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements.

Climate risks and mitigations are monitored throughout the year by 
the Executive Committee, as part of the biannual MRA process, and 
separately by a cross-functional steering group. RMDs are responsible 
for managing climate change risks and opportunities for their 
respective regions while responsibility at the country level sits with 
the country Managing Directors.

The development of action plans to manage the climate-related risks 
and maximise the opportunities, and the continual monitoring of 
progress against agreed KPIs, are integral parts of both business 
process and core activities throughout the Group. These KPIs consist 
mainly of the metrics described in the Metrics and targets section 
below, and are in line with our strategy and the conclusions of our 
scenario analysis.

Metrics and targets

Focus on food waste and GHG emissions in line with 
strategy and results of quantitative scenario analysis

In line with our commitment to the Paris Agreement and our 
sustainability strategy, which includes climate action, we have 
established climate-related metrics and targets for the short, 
medium and long-term, at both a Group and operating country level. 
We have committed to:

 – reaching climate net zero GHG emissions across our global 

operations and value chain by 2050. The climate net zero goal 
includes interim 2030 targets validated by the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi) 

 – reducing absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 46% 
by 2030 from a 2019 base year, in line with an ambition to limit 
future warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels 

 – reducing our absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from all purchased 

food and drink by 28% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, aligned with 
a trajectory to limit global warming to well below 2°C compared to 
pre-industrial levels

We have also committed to achieving carbon neutrality worldwide in 
our Group operations by 2030 (Scopes 1 and 2). To achieve this, we 
will compensate and later neutralise remaining Scope 1 and 2 direct 
GHG emissions through high-quality carbon removal projects. As a 
critical step towards lower GHG emissions, we have also committed to 
reducing food waste by 50% by 2030. To support the business to meet 
these targets the Group launched a Sustainable Financing Framework 
in July 2022 to issue sustainable debt. Under this framework, in 
September 2022 we successfully issued two sustainable bonds, 
raising proceeds of €500 million and £250 million respectively, which 
will be used to progress the Group’s sustainability initiatives and the 
delivery of its global climate net zero target. As of September 2023, we 
have allocated 50% of the proceeds raised on sustainable initiatives, 
including operating expenditures on certified ethically traded coffee 
and tea and certified sustainable fish and seafood.

Report on the Group’s website www.compass-group.com/en/investors/

Food waste

With a third of all food produced globally wasted every year, reducing 
food waste – both within our own operations and by working with 
suppliers to reduce food waste at source – is a core strategic priority for 
the Group and our businesses. By sending less food waste to landfill and 
ensuring good food is not wasted, we are helping to mitigate climate 
change, relieving pressure on natural resources. This strategy will also 
continue to enhance purchasing and product management efficiencies 
throughout our operations globally, supporting the mitigation of the 
physical and transition risks identified in our scenario analysis.

We are on track to achieve a 50% reduction in food waste by 2030, 
which we see as our most immediate contribution to reducing GHG 
emissions. This year, we have more than doubled our food waste 
measurement capability by deploying our range of food waste 
management systems in nearly 8,000 sites across all regions, 
with data assurance provided by an independent third party. Our 
investment in technology helped deliver a 28% reduction in food 
waste in 20221. The continued global rollout will see food waste 
technology made available in relevant sites across all Compass 
markets, improving tracking and accountability of kitchen waste 
worldwide while also delivering significant reductions in the Group’s 
Scope 3 GHG emissions and clients’ carbon footprints. See page 39 
for further details on our progress on food waste this year.

Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions

We report our energy usage and Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
annually (see page 42). In 2023, we monitored the energy usage and 
GHG emissions of our owned and operated sites across 28 countries 
(2022: 29) which represent 98% of the Group’s underlying revenue2 
(2022: 98%). This year, we have again calculated our Scope 2 GHG 
emissions using market-based methodology to recognise the 
purchasing of low-carbon energy. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions normalised by revenue are disclosed on page 42.

Scope 3 GHG emissions

Of our emissions, 98% sit under Scope 3 and are related to the 
products we purchase. Although these emissions are not entirely 
within our control, we can influence changes through menu choices, 
reducing food waste or by working with suppliers to contribute to 
reductions. We have improved our methodology and we now measure 
emissions on a volume basis rather than by spend, which is a more 
accurate reflection of our Scope 3 GHG emissions. Our most recent 
data show an approximate 30% reduction in our Scope 3 purchased 
goods emissions compared to our 2019 baseline.

1.  Reported reduction based on information available at the date of publication. 
Progress on food waste reduction in 2023 will be disclosed in the Group’s 
annual Sustainability Report in January 2024.

2.  Alternative Performance Measure (APM) (see pages 206 to 213). The Group’s 
APMs are defined in note 34 (non-GAAP measures) and reconciled to GAAP 
measures in notes 2 (segmental analysis) and 34 to the consolidated financial 
statements.

This year, we have more than doubled our food 
waste measurement capability by deploying our 
range of food waste management systems in 
nearly 8,000 sites across all regions, with data 
assurance provided by an independent third party. 
Our investment in technology helped deliver a 28% 
reduction in foot waste in 20221.

Calculated with average data methodology using activity data for 94% of food spend in the USA, 95% in Australia, 
and a significant portion in the UK. All other purchased goods and services were calculated using spend data and 
environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) emissions factors. These emissions factors include upstream 
transportation for purchased goods and services, unless upstream transportation is separately purchased by 
Compass Group.
Spend-based method was used on capital goods to calculate the emissions using EEIO emissions factors.
Primary data for Scope 1 and 2 emissions was used to calculate the upstream portion of these activities (US Life Cycle 
Inventory (LCI) data for most countries). France was calculated using energy usage per meal and fuel usage for 
transportation emissions.
Upstream transportation emissions are included in emissions for category 3.1 (Purchased goods and services) 
unless purchased separately. Transportation represented in category 3.4 was calculated using spend data and 
EEIO emissions factors. France was extrapolated based on data from freight providers.
Waste studies for each country were used to approximate food waste based on purchased food. France was 
calculated based on estimated waste per meal.
Air travel was calculated based on total miles travelled, taking into account country-specific domestic versus 
international flights, to determine average emissions load. In countries with primary data available, ground travel was 
also calculated based on total miles travelled by mode of transportation, using each country’s government-published 
emissions factors. In other countries, ground travel emissions were estimated based on total spend for travel.
Employee commuting was calculated using total number of employees commuting, commuting days in a year, 
assumed commute distances, assumed vehicle types, and emissions factors from each country’s government-
published emissions factors.
Compass Group does not lease upstream assets. Energy usage in client kitchens was previously included in this 
category but is now included in category 3.11 (Use of sold products).
Compass Group’s use of sold products primarily comprises energy usage in client kitchens. Energy use calculations 
were estimated using factors based on electrical and natural gas usage in commercial kitchens by revenue. 
Differences in food costs and consumer prices across countries were normalised using food indices from FAOSTAT. 
Energy usage in client kitchens was previously represented in category 3.8 (Upstream leased assets).
Estimates were made for both end-of-life food waste and packaging waste. Food waste rates are country-specific. 
All packaging is assumed to end up as waste, and the quantity of packaging is estimated according to average 
packaging mass:product ratios based on submitted food weights. These emissions were previously treated as 
category 3.5 (Waste generated in operations).
Calculations were based on revenue data and EEIO emissions factors for relevant sectors. For partially-owned 
investments, revenue is allocated to Compass by percentage of ownership or period of ownership, and only this 
portion is used for emissions estimates. This category was previously not relevant.

Building a low-carbon supply chain can only be achieved through 
close collaboration with our supply chain partners. In the UK&I this 
year, we have mandated that all suppliers establish science-based 
targets, while in the US we hosted roundtable discussions with our key 
suppliers to explore their carbon reduction strategies. 

technology which will allow us to further reduce food waste, more 
accurately refine our menu and production planning, and enhance 
procurement efficiency. The target for this KPI was met in 2023, with 
the 2024 annual bonus KPI focusing on driving usage of the 
technology (see page 120).

Calculations of Scope 3 emissions going forward

Work on other metric categories

In order to monitor our progress in reaching our 2030 science-based 
targets, we will continue to measure and disclose our relevant Scope 3 
emissions annually.

Internal carbon pricing

We recognise the importance of having an effective internal carbon 
pricing system in place, as well as the effects of a possible increase in 
the price of carbon offsets going forward. We therefore continue to 
assess how to introduce an internal carbon pricing method as a matter 
of priority whilst we evolve our data reporting systems to be able to 
capture data at a product level, which would be a critical enabler.

Remuneration

To further strengthen our targets and commitments, the 
Remuneration Committee introduced a new ESG KPI for the 2023 
annual bonus plan for executive directors and senior management, 
to support our sustainability priorities (see pages 116 to 117). This 
focuses on reducing food waste across our operations, targeting an 
annual increase in the number of sites recording food waste using 
industry-leading technology. This has been effective in focusing our 
leadership to accelerate the deployment of food waste management 

We recognise the importance of measurement and follow-up to drive 
change and have considered the seven metric categories in the 
TCFD recommendations. In addition to the metrics mentioned 
above, we will continue to explore how to measure transition risks, 
physical risks, climate-related opportunities and capital deployment 
to the extent relevant.

Conclusion

We are encouraged by the findings of the expanded scenario analysis 
this year, which support and reaffirm our sustainability strategy and 
the mitigating actions we are already taking across our global 
operations. Though additional climate-related risks have been 
identified, we are confident in our ability to manage these risks whilst 
maximising the available opportunities. Consequently, we expect the 
net impact to be immaterial to the Group.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to collaborate with partners 
in our ecosystem to decarbonise while continuing to work with 
external experts to broaden the scope of our efforts in this area and 
further improve our TCFD disclosures year-on-year.

Ian Meakins
Chair of the Board

Dear Shareholder

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Compass Group PLC’s 
annual Corporate Governance and Directors’ Report for the financial 
year ended 30 September 2023. Throughout this and other parts of 
the Annual Report, we have sought to provide shareholders and other 
stakeholders with an insight into how our governance framework has 
supported our performance during the year.

Board changes, succession planning and talent pipeline

This year, as part of the ongoing succession planning process, the 
Nomination Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the 
composition of the Board, together with the succession plans for the 
Board and the Executive Committee and key roles in the Group’s 
North America business. The review considered the tenure of the 
Board’s non-executive directors and the skills and experience that will 
be needed in the future as directors retire, having served their term in 
office, and as the food services industry continues to evolve.

In May, the Nomination Committee recommended the appointment of 
Leanne Wood as a non-executive director to the Board. Leanne will 
stand for election at the forthcoming AGM in February 2024. More 
details of the appointment process and Leanne’s induction are on 
page 94. The Committee also considered changes to the roles and 
responsibilities of some non-executive directors, and recommended 
these to the Board. 

Following Gary Green’s decision to retire and step down from the 
Board, as announced in September 2023, the Committee considered 
the appointment of his successor and also the appointment of a new 
Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO). I am pleased to report that our 
detailed succession planning processes ensured there was an 
exceptional pipeline of internal talent available, and this has enabled 
us to fill these two key Board positions with internal candidates. 
Carol Arrowsmith will retire from the Board at the conclusion of the 
2024 AGM having served more than nine years on the Board. More 
details of all of these changes can be found in the Nomination 
Committee report on pages 94 and 95.

In the coming year, the Committee will continue to focus on 
succession planning for the Board and Executive Committee, ensuring 
there is a strong and diverse pipeline of future senior leaders.

Diversity, equity and inclusion

Across the Group, we continue to ensure the workforce is 
representative of the communities that Compass serves, and 
we are making promising headway. Information on the initiatives 
being implemented to drive positive change can be found in People on 
pages 32 to 37 and also on our website, www.compass-group.com.

At Board level, changes made in recent years reflect our aim for better 
gender balance and diversity in its broadest sense, and we will 
continue to advance this agenda. As set out on page 65, we have 
made good progress. At the date of this Report, 38% of directors are 
women versus 33% last year. In July, Anne-Françoise Nesmes 
succeeded John Bryant as Senior Independent Director, and three 
members of the Board are from a minority ethnic background. In the 
coming year, we hope to meet the target of having at least 40% of 
Board membership represented by women.

Audit tender process

This year was KPMG’s 10th year as the Company’s external auditor 
and, during the year, the Audit Committee conducted a competitive 
tender process for the role of external statutory auditor. Following the 
conclusion of the tender process, the Audit Committee recommended 
to the Board that the incumbent, KPMG LLP, be reappointed as the 
Company’s external auditor. More detail about the audit tender process 
can be found in the Audit Committee report on pages 87 and 88.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters

Throughout the year, the Board was kept up to date on the progress 
and effectiveness of the Group’s ESG strategies. With regard to 
environmental matters, the Board and the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee have reviewed the Group’s progress toward its climate net 
zero commitment, and closely monitored the developing sustainability 
disclosure landscape and reporting frameworks. On social matters, we 
reviewed plans to create lifetime career opportunities and to further 
improve the experience of employees in the Group, including 
initiatives designed to give back to and create value for the 
communities in which Compass operates. As part of the Group’s 
continuing drive to improve its safety culture, the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee approved a move from the Lost Time Injury 
Frequency Rate (LTIFR) workplace health and safety performance 
measure, to the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) 
performance measure for 2024, reflecting the continuing maturity 
of Compass’ safety culture.

More detail on these matters can be found on in the Strategic report 
on pages 1 to 55 and on our website, www.compass-group.com.

Governance reforms

The Board and its committees continue to monitor developments in 
governance, particularly the proposed changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2018 and the proposed audit reforms.

Change in presentation currency

The Board approved a change in the Group’s presentation currency 
from sterling to US dollars to take effect from 1 October 2023. More 
information can be found on pages 81 and 84.

Stakeholders

Board effectiveness

The Board values engagement with stakeholders. As set out on 
page 74, for practical reasons, most stakeholder engagement takes 
place between the Company’s subsidiaries and their stakeholders at 
an operational level. Direct engagement between members of the 
Board and stakeholders is principally with employees and investors. 
However, the Board ensures that there are effective mechanisms in 
place to support the continuous flow of information between the 
Board, senior management and the wider organisation to enable the 
Board to understand the views of all our stakeholders.

This year, we conducted an internal evaluation of the Board and its 
committees. The results of the evaluation concluded that the Board 
and its committees continue to operate effectively, and I am confident 
that we have an appropriate balance of capability, skills, experience 
and diversity on the Board to continue to do so. However, we are not 
complacent, and we have identified a number of priorities for the 
Board and its committees for the year ahead to help us continue to 
build on the progress we have made to date, and to contribute to the 
ongoing success of the Group.

Details of how the Board has oversight of stakeholders’ interests, 
together with examples of how decisions taken by the Board  
have impacted stakeholders during the year, can be found on 
pages 74 to 79 and 81.

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018

Compliance statement

Board leadership and company purpose

It is the Board’s view that for the financial year ended 
30 September 2023, the Company was compliant with the 
principles and provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2018 (the Code) with the following exception. During the first 
three months of the financial year, the Company did not comply 
with provision 38 (alignment of executive director pension 
contribution rates with those available to the workforce).  
The Company has been compliant with provision 38 since 
31 December 2022, when existing pension benefits for executive 
directors were aligned to the maximum rate available to the

1.  The information above is stated as at 30 September 2023.
2.  The FCA’s Listing Rules now set board diversity targets for listed companies that (i) at least 40% of the Board are women, (ii) at least one of the roles of CEO, CFO, 
Chair and SID is held by a woman and (iii) at least one director is from a minority ethnic background. Compass has met the targets for (ii) and (iii) but does not yet 
meet the target of 40% of the Board being women. During the year, the Company undertook a search for two new non-executive directors and took steps to ensure 
that a diverse pool of candidates was identified. As a result of the search, the Company offered roles to two female candidates but only one of those candidates 
accepted. The Company is continuing its search in the coming year and hopes to meet all the FCA’s targets by the end of 2024.

3.  Gary Green will step down as an executive director on 30 November 2023. Petros Parras will be appointed as an executive director from 1 December 2023. These 

changes will not affect the Board’s gender identity/sex or ethnic background percentages shown above.

Responsibilities of the Board

Leadership

Sustainability

The Board leads the Group’s governance structure. It provides 
stewardship of the Company to safeguard its long-term sustainable 
success, creating value for shareholders and enabling the Company 
and its subsidiaries to contribute to the communities and wider 
societies in which they operate. The Board is responsible for setting 
the tone from the top by demonstrating leadership.

Purpose, values and culture

The Group’s corporate culture is integral to its success. It defines 
Compass, what the Company stands for, and how it does business. 
Compass’ reputation has been built on a solid foundation of ethical 
values, underpinned by a well-defined and effective system of 
governance. This culture has assisted in the creation and protection 
of the long-term value of the Company and supports its strategy to 
deliver sustainable growth.

The Board defines the purpose of the Company and the values that 
guide it. A common set of expected behaviours based on Compass’ 
corporate values, and an effective system of governance, are 
described in the Code of Business Conduct (CBC). These have 
shaped and embedded a strong ethical and governance culture 
across the Group.

The Group CEO and other members of the executive management 
team actively promote ethical standards to ensure they are 
maintained, and good governance is put into practice.

Key functions such as Legal, Finance, People, Ethics and Integrity 
and Internal Audit also promote and embed high standards of ethical 
behaviour and corporate governance across the Group.

The Board, supported by its committees, monitors the alignment of 
the Group’s culture with its purpose, values and strategy through 
a variety of mechanisms, cultural indicators and reporting lines, 
including those summarised below.

Cultural indicators

 – Lost Time Incident Frequency Rate (LTIFR)
 – Food Safety Incident Rate (FSIR)

pulse surveys

Workforce engagement

The Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement 
(DNED) provides a communication channel between the Group’s 
workforce and the Board to ensure that the employee voice is 
represented in the boardroom. As part of a structured programme 
of engagement, the DNED, Ireena Vittal, held six roundtable meetings 
in the year with a diverse set of employees representing different 
sectors, countries and cultures. In addition, non-executive director, 
Arlene Isaacs-Lowe held two further employee roundtable meetings. 
The outcomes of the discussions were reported back to the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee. Read more about these workforce 
engagement sessions on pages 75 and 91.

Governance and risk

The Board is responsible for oversight of risk and for setting risk 
appetite. It ensures that the necessary resources are in place for the 
Company to meet its objectives to measure its performance. A robust 
governance and risk management framework is in place to ensure that 
each business is being operated and managed appropriately, and that 
prudent and effective controls are in place to identify emerging and 
principal risks and to manage and mitigate those risks. Read more 
about risk management on pages 24 to 30.

Group strategy

The Board’s approval, effective oversight and monitoring of the 
implementation of strategy are vital to the long-term sustainable 
success of the Group. The Board considers and approves the 
Group’s strategic aims over the short, medium and long-term. 
The implementation of strategy is monitored and evaluated on an 
ongoing basis. Food service remains at the core of Compass’ strategy. 
The market for food service continues to provide significant structural 
growth opportunities. To ensure Compass remains well placed to 
capture future market opportunities, the business continues to create 
innovative, bespoke offerings tailored to the needs of clients and 
consumers. More details of Compass’ business model and strategy 
can be found on pages 1 to 55.

Engagement with stakeholders

The Board ensures that the Company continues to operate in the 
best interests of its shareholders as a whole. In exercising its duty to 
promote the success of the Company, the Board also has regard to 
other stakeholders, the environment, the reputation of the Company 
and the need to act fairly between its members. How the Company 
engages with its stakeholders and how the Board has oversight of 
stakeholder engagement is described on pages 74 to 79. The 
Company’s Section 172 Statement can be found on page 80.

Management delegation and oversight

The Board delegates the delivery of strategy and day-to-day 
operational management of the Group to the Executive Committee, 
which is led by the Group CEO.

Responsibilities of the Board continued

Roles in the boardroom

The Board comprises executive and non-executive directors, which ensures that no individual or small group of individuals dominates the Board’s 
decision-making. All non-executive directors, except the Chair of the Board, are considered independent. The Chair was considered to be 
independent on appointment. The roles and responsibilities of Board members are detailed below and demonstrate a clear division between the 
roles and responsibilities of the Board and executive management. The role descriptions of the Chair of the Board, Group CEO and SID are

Board meetings

Board meetings are held through a combination of physical and virtual attendance. Each year, the Board aims to hold one or two meetings 
overseas. This year, the Board visited the Group’s business in the US. 

Overseas visits provide an opportunity to assess local management performance and potential, gain further insight into how the business works on 
a day-to-day basis and to speak face-to-face with local management to better understand the challenges they face and listen to their views.

By visiting operations, directors meet with a diverse group of colleagues including regional, country and senior management and high-potential 
employees on a more informal basis, which supports the succession planning process. The format of visits often comprises an overview of the 
country’s macroeconomic environment and social trends, the challenges and opportunities facing the business combined with a review of the 
competitive landscape, and a detailed review of the relevant sectors in which the business operates, including its people and its three-year plan.

In addition to health and safety, and routine financial and operating reports and updates, the Board spends time reviewing Group strategy and 
performance against the strategic plan.

Meetings between the Chair of the Board and non-executive directors, both with and without the presence of the Group CEO, are scheduled in the 
Board’s annual programme.

During the year, the non-executive directors held regular meetings without the presence of the executives, typically following each Board meeting. 
These meetings provide the non-executive directors with a forum in which to share experiences and discuss wider business topics. In addition, the 
non-executive directors attended a dinner without the executive directors present.

At every meeting, the Board is briefed on aspects of the Group’s 
strategic pillars: People, Performance and Purpose.

People

Performance

People are Compass’ greatest asset. During the year, the Board and 
the Nomination Committee continued their focus on developing the 
Board’s blend of skills and experience. The Board also continued its 
employee engagement efforts through a variety of means including 
roundtable meetings and site visits.

In March, the Board visited the Group’s US business. During the visit, 
the Board attended the annual Envision Summit at the University of 
Miami. The Envision Group provides expertise and functional support 
to all operating sectors in the US, with a focus on growth, innovation 
and performance underpinned by sustainability.

At the summit, the Board and other delegates listened to 
presentations from business leaders, and toured stands showcasing 
frictionless technologies and brands which are being deployed by 
Compass to deliver quality food and hospitality experiences and a 
positive impact for the food system. Afterwards, the Board met with 
the senior North America leadership team and other delegates on an 
informal basis and listened to their perspectives.

In May, Leanne Wood joined the Board, building on the work already 
undertaken to broaden the diversity and capabilities of the Board. 
Leanne is the current Chief Human Resources Officer of Vodafone 
Group Plc and has extensive HR, strategic and operational 
experience. The Board fully supports management’s ambition to 
create a diverse workforce and to increase female representation at 
senior levels in the organisation. 

The role of the DNED is to provide an effective communication 
channel between the Group’s workforce and the Board to ensure that 
the employee voice is represented in the boardroom. Ireena Vittal has 
been the DNED since 2019. This year, the Board approved the 
Nomination Committee’s recommendation that Ireena’s tenure in this 
role be extended until the conclusion of her term in office as a 
non-executive director. Details of the employee roundtables held by 
Ireena during the year together with the meetings held by her Board 
colleague, Arlene Isaacs-Lowe, can be found on page 75.

During the year, a number of the non-executive directors separately 
visited some of the businesses’ operations in Australia, Portugal, 
Switzerland and the US. During the visits, the directors met with local 
management and toured client sites in the Business & Industry and 
Education sectors. These visits gave the non-executive directors the 
opportunity to engage with clients to understand what is important to 
them and why they choose to work with Compass. Time was also spent 
talking to front line employees and consumers and listening to their 
feedback. One director took the opportunity to assist the local team 
with operational tasks and to join a safety moment before service 
commenced for the day. These visits provided the directors with a 
first-hand experience of the Group’s businesses, the challenges and 
opportunities facing them, and the views of stakeholders.

Regular reports from management, feedback from activities 
undertaken by Ireena Vittal and her Board colleagues and other 
initiatives have helped inform the Board’s discussions and decision-
making during the year. More information on our People initiatives can 
be found on pages 32 to 37.

Throughout the year, the Board monitored the Group’s performance 
against the strategic framework and priorities, including M&A, global 
trends, and risks and opportunities. To assist it, the Board received 
regular reports from the Group CEO and the Group CFO, and 
presentations from each of the Group’s Regional Managing Directors 
on regional performance. It also received updates from key functional 
heads, e.g. Legal, Tax, Treasury, Information Systems and Technology, 
and People on matters that could have an impact on the Group’s 
financial or operational performance.

In March, the Board reviewed the strategic plans for the Group. The 
Group’s strategic priorities continued to be focused on organic growth 
across all sectors and geographies supplemented through disciplined 
M&A. The Board reviewed the addressable food services market 
analysed by region and sector together with the continued structural 
growth opportunities available to the Group, which were expected to 
deliver future revenue growth. The Board also reviewed the three 
strategic pillars underpinning the growth ambitions, namely People, 
Performance, and Purpose. 

The Board receives reports from the Group CEO at every meeting on 
progress against the Group’s strategy. In addition, the Board receives 
annual business updates from the regional management teams 
setting out progress against their regional strategic objectives. 

At each meeting, the Board receives a report from the Group CFO 
setting out the financial performance of the regions and the Group in 
the latest period and for the year to date. The Board considers the key 
financial performance metrics, including revenue, organic revenue 
growth, operating profit and margin, operating cashflow and cashflow 
conversion. It also regularly reviews the financial outlook of the Group. 
Additionally, the Group CFO’s report provides the Board with updates 
on tax and treasury matters, cyber-security arrangements and 
technology developments.

In September, the Board reviewed the Group’s preliminary budget for 
the financial year ending 2024 and the three-year plan for 2024-2026. 
The Board reviewed the key financial metrics against the backdrop of 
an uncertain economic climate and elevated levels of inflation. The 
budget and the three-year plan were both approved in principle 
subject to final approval being given in November 2023.

Twice a year, the Board reviews the material financial and non-
financial risks facing the Group’s businesses, including new and 
emerging risks, and agrees the Group’s principal risks at the half and 
full-year. It also considers the identification of risks and opportunities, 
the development of action plans to manage risks and maximise 
opportunities, and the continual monitoring of progress against agreed 
key performance indicators. The Board agreed that due to the 
escalating tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine 
conflict, the trend for geopolitical risk should be elevated to reflect the 
year-on-year increase in risk. The Group’s principal risks, and how 
these are managed, are set out on pages 24 to 30.

72 

Governance

Board activities continued

The Board has also established processes for identifying emerging 
risks and horizon scanning for risks that may arise over the medium to 
long-term. The Board has identified artificial intelligence (AI) as an 
emerging risk as the democratisation of generative AI has given 
widespread access to powerful online AI services for content creation. 

During the year, the Board conducted a post-investment review which 
sampled around 20 client contracts. The review considered the 
profiles of the contracts, including: annual revenues, capital 
expenditure and investment returns by sector and region, post-tax 
returns and contract ROCE, the performance of new and retained 
contracts versus the original business case, and proactive contract life 
cycle management designed to safeguard returns. The detailed 
post-investment review concluded that the Group’s disciplined 
approach was creating shareholder value. 

Following a recommendation from the Audit Committee, the Board 
approved a change in the Group’s presentation currency from sterling 
to US dollars with effect from 1 October 2023. This will provide 
investors and other stakeholders with greater transparency over the 
Group’s performance and will mitigate foreign exchange volatility on 
earnings, given that approximately three-quarters of the Group’s 
underlying operating profit originates in US dollars. 

The Board also received a presentation from chefs and culinary 
innovators from the Group’s Global Culinary Forum. The Forum was 
created to bring together key culinary talent to collaborate and 
exchange ideas and share best practices by tapping into the rich seam 
of knowledge and unique insights from those at the forefront of the 
Group’s businesses. The Board was keen to understand the progress 
being made by the Forum, which is helping to drive better commercial 
and sustainability outcomes. More information on our strategy and 
business model can be found on pages 1 to 55.

Purpose

At every meeting, the Board is briefed by the Group CEO on Purpose 
including up-to-date performance data on the Group’s workplace 
health and safety and food safety metrics against the established 
limits set at the beginning of the year. It is also briefed on the progress 
being made on the Group’s sustainability agenda, including the new 
food waste metric which was introduced at the beginning of the year, 
and social initiatives. 

During the year, the Corporate Responsibility Committee monitored 
the adoption of food waste tracking technology in operations across 
the Group. Reducing food waste is one of the greatest environmental 
challenges facing our sector and therefore one where we have the 
greatest potential to make a significant difference. More information 
about our efforts to reduce food waste can be found on page 39.

In February, the Chair of the Board, together with the Group CEO, 
Group CFO, SID and Committee Chairs attended the 2023 AGM with 
the other directors participating online. The AGM is an important 
event in the Board’s calendar where directors have the opportunity to 
listen to the perspective of shareholders, answer their questions and 
to meet with them on a more informal basis. At the 2023 AGM, 
shareholders asked questions about a wide range of topics including 
Compass’ approach to the UK real living wage, job security, diversity, 
equity and inclusion, animal welfare and sustainability. In addition to 
the AGM, the Group CEO, Group CFO, other directors and senior 
managers also met regularly with investors as part of the Group’s 
investor engagement programme, details of which can be found on 
page 76. The Remuneration Committee Chair also engaged 
extensively with investors during the year, and details of that 
engagement can be found on pages 97, 98, 103 and 104.

In November 2022, the Board considered and approved the 
Company’s 2022 Modern Slavery Act (MSA) Statement which 
provides an update on the progress made in the last year to further 
develop Compass’ approach to mitigating the risks of modern slavery 
in the Group’s businesses and their supply chains.

The 2022 MSA Statement can be found on our website,  
www.compass-group.com.

The 2023 MSA Statement will be published on our website in 
December 2023. More information about the Group’s Purpose can be 
found on pages 38 to 44.

During the year, the directors participated in a training session 
delivered by the Group’s sustainability team, the external auditor and 
the Company’s external sustainability advisers, which focused on the 
evolving ESG landscape. The directors discussed the developing 
disclosure requirements under the EU Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive and the International Sustainability Standard 
Board’s first two sustainability reporting standards, together with 
recent TCFD developments. The training session also highlighted 
developments in the broader ESG landscape and the growing 
expectations of stakeholders.

Conflicts of interest

As part of their ongoing development, executive directors are 
permitted to take on one external non-executive role on a non-
competitor listed company board, subject to prior approval by the 
Board. Fees earned for the appointment may be retained by the 
director. The Board monitors the extent of directors’ other interests 
and the time commitment required to fulfil those interests to ensure 
that the effectiveness of the Board is not compromised.

Each director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a 
situation in which they have, or might have, a direct or indirect interest 
that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the 
Company. This duty is in addition to the obligation owed to the 
Company to disclose to the Board an interest in any transaction or 
arrangement being considered by the Company. The Company’s 
articles of association authorise the directors to approve such 
situations and to apply other provisions to allow conflicts of interest 
to be managed. The Board follows an established procedure when 
deciding whether to authorise an actual or potential conflict of 
interest. Only independent directors (i.e. those with no interest in 
the matter under consideration) can make the relevant decision. 
In making a decision, the directors must act in good faith and in a 
way they consider most likely to promote the Company’s success. 
Further, the directors may, if appropriate, impose limits or conditions 
when granting authorisation.

The Board considered and authorised each director’s reported actual 
and potential conflicts of interest at its meeting in July 2023. It also 
considered any changes on an ad-hoc basis throughout the year. Any 
authorised conflicts are reviewed at least every 15 months.

Board administration

Information and support

All directors have access to the advice of the Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, who ensures that satisfactory Board 
procedures are followed, and good corporate governance 
and compliance processes and practices are adhered to. Together 
with the Group CEO and the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, the Chair of the Board ensures that the Board is kept 
properly informed and is consulted on all matters reserved for it, that 
Board papers are of a high standard, and that information is 
distributed in a timely fashion to allow directors to be suitably 
prepared in advance of meetings.

The Board has established a procedure for directors, if deemed 
necessary, to seek independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties.

In accordance with the Company’s articles of association, directors 
have been granted an indemnity by the Company to the extent 
permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their 
office. The indemnity would not provide any coverage where a director 
is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company has 
also arranged appropriate insurance cover in respect of potential legal 
action against its directors and officers.

Board effectiveness, induction, training and development

A formal and rigorous evaluation of the Board, its committees, the 
Chair of the Board and individual directors is conducted every year. 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for overseeing the 
evaluation process. The Chair of the Board is responsible for acting on 
the evaluation’s results, recognising strengths and addressing any 
areas for improvement that have been identified. The details of this 
year’s internal evaluation process can be found on page 96.

The Chair of the Board addresses the developmental needs of the 
Board. All directors are required to refresh and update their skills, 
knowledge, expertise and familiarity with the Company on an ongoing 
basis, ensuring that the Board continues to operate effectively. 
A formal, comprehensive and tailored induction is provided to all 
directors following their appointment, including external training, visits 
to key locations within the Group, and meetings with members of the 
Executive Committee, other senior executives and functional heads. 
The induction also covers a review of the Group’s governance policies 
and structures, including details of the risks and operating issues 
facing the Group.

As part of ongoing training, the Board and its committees receive 
regular updates from expert advisers such as the Group’s auditors, 
external legal counsel, remuneration advisers and internal subject 
matter experts, and have access to external training courses where 
appropriate. The Chair of the Board, supported by the Nomination 
Committee, considers the training needs of directors as part of the 
annual evaluation process. Where a training need is identified by the 
Nomination Committee or a director, the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary facilitates this.

Governance

Stakeholder 
engagement

Compass is a geographically and culturally diverse business with 
operations in around 35 countries. As a result, it has a global and 
diverse community of stakeholders, each with their own interests in, 
and expectations of the Company.

As set out in the Strategic report, we have a decentralised structure 
enabling the development of strategies on a country-by-country and 
sector-by-sector basis for which country management are responsible 
and accountable. The Board’s role is therefore to provide a framework 
that gives the Group’s businesses the freedom and flexibility to make 
decisions, pursue opportunities, and manage risks.

Responsibility for the day-to-day operational management and 
implementation of Group strategy has been delegated to the 
Group Executive Committee, led by the Group CEO.

To enable the effective day-to-day running of the Group’s businesses, 
the country Managing Directors and local leadership teams are 
responsible for local strategy, execution, and compliance, in 
alignment with Group values, governance and standards. 
Depending on the region, an additional layer of regional and 
functional leadership is present. As a result, stakeholder engagement 
primarily takes place at a local operational level, and the Board relies 
on local management to keep it informed of the impact of the Group’s 
operations on its stakeholders.

During the year, the Board and the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee considered information from across the Group’s 
businesses and received presentations from management. This 
enabled the Board to consider the likely consequences of decisions 
over the long term and, where relevant, the impact on stakeholders 
and the environment. Examples of decisions made during the year, 
and the stakeholders impacted, are given on page 81.

A summary of how Compass engages with its stakeholders and 
how the Board is involved and kept informed of stakeholder 
engagement follows.

Clients

How the Board has oversight

The Board is kept informed of business performance by the 
Regional Managing Directors (RMDs), who provide an overview 
of operations at a regional, country and sector level. The RMDs 
are supported by their senior leadership and marketing teams, 
who provide further analysis of the client base. From these 
reports and those of the Group CEO and Group CCO, the 
Board forms a view of the interests of the clients of the 
businesses, ongoing client engagement activities, and 
what is important to clients.

opportunities to hear directly from employees in an open 
environment, which in turn enabled the Board to better understand 
the differing views of our people.

Participants valued the opportunity to share experiences and learn 
from each other. They particularly appreciated the open, intimate 
structure of the sessions and the freedom to explore a variety of 
topics that are important to them.

The feedback from these roundtables was combined with the 
output from the Group’s wider engagement activities and were 
reported to the Corporate Responsibility Committee. The main 
themes arising from the roundtables included:

front line colleagues

 – the challenges faced by operations and functions in recruiting 

 – employee forums and virtual panel discussions, such as the 
People Happiness Forum held by Compass Middle East

 – carbon literacy training for UK Foodbuy colleagues
 – consultation with UK employees who are members of Compass’ 
UK pension schemes and the UK Works Council (which includes 
representatives nominated by recognised trade unions) on the 
proposed merger of the UK defined benefit and defined 
contribution schemes

How the Board has oversight

The Group CEO, Group CFO, Group CPO and other senior 
executives hold townhalls and make presentations to update 
employees on the Group’s strategy and performance, and on key 
initiatives such as the Group’s climate net zero commitment. 
The townhalls include Q&A sessions for employees to ask 
questions about the Group’s performance and the challenges and 
opportunities facing the business. A proportion of the time is also 
allocated during the sessions to celebrate the achievements of 
front line and other colleagues, who are able to share their 
experiences of working at Compass. 

During the year, Ireena Vittal, the DNED, engaged directly with 
employees across the Group to understand their views and 
experiences of working at Compass, hearing what could be 
improved and taking feedback on our approach to remuneration. 

Six roundtable meetings were held with employees from a variety 
of sectors, businesses and geographies across the Group as part of 
a structured programme of engagement designed and supported 
by the Group CPO. These roundtables provided the DNED with 

and retaining talent

 – the importance of development opportunities for employees
 – the positive sentiment about how Compass considers the 

wellbeing of its employees and the importance of maintaining 
focus in this area 

 – the sharing of best practices across different markets and 
businesses, which has been hugely beneficial and should 
continue to be encouraged 

 – continuing to focus on the development of unit managers

Two further employee roundtables were held in the year hosted by 
non-executive director, Arlene Isaacs-Lowe. The first session was 
held virtually when Ms Isaacs-Lowe met with colleagues 
representing the UAE, North America, and Türkiye. The second 
roundtable meeting was held face-to-face when Ms Isaacs-Lowe 
met with Black Ambassadors from the Group’s UK&I business, in 
support of the UK&I’s Black Future Month, one of a series of 
initiatives held during the year to recognise and promote 
opportunities available to the diverse communities of talent across 
the Group. These sessions provided an opportunity for black and 
ethnic minority colleagues to share their personal experiences of 
working at Compass and their views on the actions being taken by 
management to give a voice to, and inspire talent from, black and 
ethnic minority communities. 

Feedback from employee roundtables, and output from the wider 
engagement activities, enable the Board to form a view of the 
interests of employees, what is important to them, and ongoing 
engagement activities. Some examples of how the Board has 
considered employees in its decision making are set out on page 81.

Shareholders

Why we engage

Compass’ philosophy is to engage in regular, open, and 
transparent dialogue with existing and prospective 
shareholders. Their views and opinions are shared with and 
valued by the Board, which reviews the feedback and, where 
considered appropriate, takes action to address any concerns.

How we engage

Compass engages with existing investors through one-to-one 
and group meetings, webcasts, presentations, conference calls 
and the Company’s AGM.

Areas of focus

 – financial performance
 – competitive positioning
 – strategy and outlook
 – ethical business practices and sound governance
 – leadership and succession planning
 – debt and liquidity
 – sustainability and ESG
 – executive remuneration

Engagement in the year

During the year, as part of its proactive engagement 
programme organised by the Group’s Investor Relations team, 
the Company held 341 meetings (virtually and in person), with 
representatives from 430 institutional investors through a mix of 
group and one-to-one appointments. Of these, 81 were

The Chair of the Board, the Remuneration Committee Chair and 
other members of the Group’s management such as the 
Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Group CPO, 
Group Reward Director and Group CCO, as appropriate, also 
engaged with investors on a wide range of matters including 
governance, people, remuneration and sustainability. The 
Company also held a virtual investor deep dive on sustainability, 
which was attended live by 86 institutional investors and  
sell-side analysts.

The 2023 AGM was held at Twickenham Rugby Football Union 
stadium. Shareholders were encouraged to submit questions in 
advance of the meeting. All questions and answers were posted 
on the Company’s website.

How the Board has oversight

The Chair of the Board ensures that the Board maintains an 
appropriate dialogue with shareholders. The Group CEO, 
Group CFO and Head of Investor Relations and Corporate 
Communications meet regularly with institutional investors to 
discuss strategic issues and to make presentations on the 
Company’s results. 

Committee Chairs are available to engage with major shareholders 
regarding their areas of responsibility. Non-executive directors 
develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders 
through regular updates from the Head of Investor Relations 
and Corporate Communications and from external advisers. 

The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary also acts as 
an important focal point for communications on corporate 
governance matters throughout the year, particularly around 
shareholder meetings. 

All shareholders are invited to attend the Company’s AGM, 
which provides a forum where they can put questions to the 
Board and meet with individual directors and senior 
executives after the AGM.

Governance

Stakeholder engagement continued

Communities

Why we engage

Compass engages with the communities in which it operates in 
order to: build trust by operating responsibly and sustainably; 
by addressing issues that are important to the communities; 
and by providing training opportunities, careers and support to 
local people, particularly those who are not in education, 
training or employment.

Compass aims to enrich the communities in which it operates 
and to minimise its impact on the environment. Our businesses 
operate in culturally diverse communities with differing 
characteristics and needs.

How we engage

Compass operates many local employment programmes to 
recruit and develop local people to work at its sites. This includes 
partnering with local charities and organisations to raise awareness 
and donating funds to help local causes. Surplus food is also 
donated to various organisations that pass it on to people in 
their communities who need it. Through The Compass Group 
Foundation (the Foundation), we engaged with charities and 
community organisations in the US, UK, Türkiye, India, Australia, 
and Spain to fund inclusive job and training opportunities for 
under-privileged groups, as well as to empower local and 
SME suppliers.

Areas of focus

 – fair employment and equal opportunities
 – local causes and issues

Engagement in the year

The Foundation provided grants to a number of charities around 
the world, with Compass employees (where possible) volunteering 
their skills and expertise to amplify the Foundation’s impact.

In India, the Foundation and the Indian business are partnering 
with the Sai Swayam Society to train young people with speech and 
hearing disabilities in hospitality, IT, life and soft skills, which has 
increased their confidence, self-esteem and, importantly, enabled 
them to secure positions in well-respected companies. Employees 
from Compass in India have visited the organisation’s facilities to 
support with training activities and identifying job opportunities. 

In Spain, the Foundation and our Spanish business are working 
with Fundación Integra to train women who have been victims of 
domestic violence, and to provide them with free access to a 
hospitality certification via Compass Group Spain’s Women’s 
Academy. Volunteers from Compass in Spain have provided 
training and tutoring to the women as they progress with the 
qualification.

In Türkiye, the Foundation and Compass’ Türkiye business 
engaged with the Down’s Syndrome Association (DSA) to train 
and place people with Down’s Syndrome in jobs in the food and 
hospitality sector and raise awareness of the contribution of 
people with Down’s Syndrome in the job market.

In the UK, the Foundation and our UK&I business are working with 
FoodCycle to recruit and train project leaders to undertake the 
running of community kitchens to support food security and tackle 
isolation. Compass UK&I chefs have been donating their time to 
upskill FoodCycle volunteers. In addition, the Foundation is 
working with the KERB social enterprise to provide opportunities 
for very early start food business owners, particularly those from 
less advantaged backgrounds, to access street food equipment 
and to trading at a market.

In the US, the Foundation and our US business are supporting the 
Carolina Farm Stewardship Association to provide advice and 
support to small farmers in food safety planning and certification, 
focusing on sustainable farming practices and climate resilience.

In Australia, Compass Group has partnered with Foodbuy Australia 
as well as Bridging the Gap Foundation (founded by Menzies 
School of Health and Science Research), which has been granted 
seed funding by The Compass Group Foundation to pilot a 
Nutritional Hunger Program (NHP).

The NHP aims to end nutritional hunger in remote Indigenous 
communities by co-designing a programme with local Indigenous 
community leaders to find solutions to get high-quality, nutritious 
food to Indigenous communities at reasonable prices. 

During the year, further engagement took place with several 
other charities, with more projects due to be funded by the 
Foundation in 2024. 

Beyond the Foundation, there are many instances of community 
engagement across the businesses, including:

 – DelightFul week in the USA – 300 college campuses performing 

a million acts of kindness 

 – SoldierOn, an Australian organisation dedicated to supporting 

veterans and their families including a focus on creating 
employment opportunities and investing in mental health
 – Mission to a Million – Compass Group UK&I’s commitment to 
provide support to one million people by 2030 through jobs, 
training, community engagement and development

How the Board has oversight

Community engagement is primarily achieved though liaison 
with local organisations and representatives and via initiatives that 
are sensitive to cultural differences. The Board is kept informed of 
such activity through the Corporate Responsibility Committee, 
which receives regular reports from the Group CCO and the 
Sustainability team, and through the presentations given to the 
Board by the regional and country management teams.

Governance

Statement on Section 172  
of the Companies Act 2006

Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires the directors to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of the members as a whole, 
having regard to the interests of stakeholders in their decision-making. In making decisions, the directors consider what is most likely to promote 
the success of the Company for its shareholders in the long term, as well as the interests of the Group’s other stakeholders. The directors 
understand the importance of taking into account the views of stakeholders and the impact of the Company’s activities on local communities, 
the environment, including climate change, and the Group’s reputation.

The table below sets out the areas of this Report which demonstrate how the directors have had regard to their Section 172 responsibilities.

Capital expenditure

During the year, the Board considered capital expenditure requests 
from the Group’s North America business in connection with the 
implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software to 
replace in-unit accounting systems which had reached the end of life. 

Before arriving at its decision, the Board considered the benefits and 
challenges of implementing the new ERP software, noting that it would 
help: simplify operational processes; create business efficiencies (e.g. 
automate contractual billings and payments; automate vendor invoice 
processing and workflow management, and reduce manual journal 
entries); and improve data accuracy and the overall control environment.

The Board noted that the ERP software had been piloted at two large 
and complex Education sites with the purpose of testing and validating 
the operation of ERP software in live units, validating the assumed 
risks of significant process changes, and to inform the requirements 
for scaled deployment. 

The Board approved the capital expenditure requirements on the 
basis that it would strengthen and improve operational and 
organisational processes, which was beneficial to the Group’s North 
America employees, clients and suppliers.

Consideration of 
stakeholder interests 
during the year

The examples below give an insight into how the Board had regard for 
the interests of its stakeholders in some of its decision-making 
processes during the year.

Key decisions

Shareholder returns

The Board recognises the importance of shareholder returns and, 
during the year, rewarded shareholders by recommending a final 
dividend of 22.1 pence per share for the financial year ended 2022, 
and approving an interim dividend of 15.0 pence per share for the 
financial year ended 2023. The Board also approved share buybacks 
of £1 billion (£250 million in H1 and £750 million in H2) in the year 
under review.

In its deliberations, the Board considered the Group’s strong financial 
performance in the financial year ended 2022 and in the first six 
months of the 2023 financial year, including its cash position and 
distributable reserves, together with its stated dividend policy and 
capital allocation model, as set out on pages 6 and 20. The Board also 
considered shareholders’ views and the impact of the dividend 
payments and share buybacks on the Group’s UK defined benefit 
pension scheme. The Board concluded that approval of the dividends 
and the share buybacks were in the best interests of the Company and 
its shareholders as a whole and that there was no material impact on 
the UK pension scheme in light of its current surplus.

Stakeholder impact:

Shareholders

People

Presentation currency

The Company announced with the half-year results in May 2023, that 
it would change its reporting currency from sterling to US dollars with 
effect from 1 October 2023.

In coming to that decision, the Board carefully considered the relative 
merits of such a change and the impact for shareholders. The Board 
concluded the change in presentation currency was in the interests  
of shareholders and other stakeholders and would provide them  
with greater transparency of the Group’s performance and reduce 
foreign exchange volatility on earnings given that approximately 
three-quarters of the Group’s underlying operating profit originates  
in US dollars.

Governance

Audit Committee 
report

Anne-Françoise Nesmes
Chair of the Audit Committee

Governance

Anne-Françoise Nesmes was appointed Chair of the Audit Committee 
in February 2021 and is the serving Chief Financial Officer of 
Smith+Nephew PLC. She is a chartered management accountant and 
is considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial 
experience and to be competent in auditing and accounting. 

Committee membership comprises the Chair of the Committee and 
all of the non-executive directors (other than the Chair of the Board). 
Each member of the Committee has appropriate financial and 
commercial experience in multinational and/or complex organisations, 
combined with a sound understanding of the Company’s business, 
and is therefore considered by the Board to be competent in the 
Company’s sector. The expertise and experience of the directors can 
be found in the biographies on pages 59 to 61. The Board considers 
each member of the Committee to be independent in accordance with 
the criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the 
Code) and capable of assessing the work of management, the 
assurances provided by the Internal Audit function and the external 
auditor, as well as the effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control systems.

Members of the Committee are appointed by the Board following 
recommendation by the Nomination Committee. The Committee 
meets at least three times a year. The quorum for a meeting is two 
members. The Committee held three meetings during the year. The 
meetings attendance table can be found on page 69. The Chair of the 
Committee reports to the Board on Committee activities and engages 
regularly with key individuals involved with the Company’s governance. 
The Chair also has regular contact with the external Senior Statutory 
Audit Partner and attends the AGM to respond to any shareholder 
questions that might be raised on the Committee’s activities.

Only members of the Committee have the right to attend Committee 
meetings. Other individuals such as the Chair of the Board, the Group 
CEO, Group CFO, Group Financial Controller, Director of Financial 
Planning & Analysis, Group Director of Risk and Internal Audit, Group 
Chief Information Officer (CIO), Group Head of Tax, Group Head of 
Ethics and Integrity (E&I) and external advisers, may be invited to 
attend all or part of any meetings, as and when appropriate. The 
Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, who acts as 
Secretary to the Committee, attends all meetings of the Committee. 
The external auditor also attends all meetings of the Committee. Other 
members of senior management are invited to present such reports as 
are required for the Committee to discharge its duties. At the end of 
every meeting, Committee members hold private discussions with the 
external auditor, without executive management and other invitees 
being present. Committee members also have discussions with the 
Group Director of Risk and Internal Audit without executive 
management and other invitees being present. 

The Committee is authorised to seek external legal and independent 
professional advice as it sees fit. The terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee are reviewed annually to ensure they continue to be fit for 
purpose. They were last reviewed in September 2023. The review 
concluded that the terms of reference of the Committee in their 
current form continue to reflect best practice. 

A copy of the terms of reference can be found on our website,  
www.compass-group.com. 

The Committee has an annual agenda which is aligned to the terms 
of reference and key events in the Company’s financial calendar. 
The agenda is flexible enough to include additional topics of 
particular importance to the Committee and to allow it to respond 
to emerging issues.

Committee activities during the year

The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the 
Company’s and the Group’s published financial statements and 
related disclosures; and for assessing any formal announcements 
relating to the Group’s financial reporting matters, as well as key 
accounting and audit judgements related to the preparation of the 
Company’s and the Group’s financial statements. The Committee’s 
other responsibilities include:

 – reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control systems, including the Group’s key internal 
controls over financial reporting and IT controls framework, and 
providing assurance to the Board

 – reviewing the going concern and viability statements
 – monitoring and reviewing the role, mandate and effectiveness of the 

Group’s Internal Audit function

 – managing the selection, appointment, independence, effectiveness 

and remuneration of the Group’s external auditor, including 
compliance with the Non-Audit Services Policy. In the year, this 
included primary responsibility for a formal statutory audit tender 
process

 – reviewing arrangements for the Group’s workforce/stakeholders to 

raise concerns in confidence about possible improprieties in 
financial reporting or other matters (via Speak Up, We’re Listening), 
and ensuring that they are investigated

 – advising the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities and 
considering whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and providing 
assurance to the Board

The key priorities of the Committee during the year under review are 
described in the pages that follow.

Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

Financial reporting and accounting matters

During the year, the Committee reviewed the interim and annual 
financial statements and considered the following:

 – whether the description of the performance of the Group in the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy

 – the clarity of disclosures and compliance with financial 

reporting standards and relevant financial and governance 
reporting requirements and guidelines, including Alternative 
Performance Measures

 – the accounting policies adopted in the Group’s financial statements, 
any proposed changes to them and the adequacy of their disclosure

 – the significant transactions, accounting matters, and key 

judgements and estimates used in preparing the 2023 Annual 

Report and Accounts and the interim financial statements and in 
particular management’s assumptions underpinning the going 
concern and viability statements

 – the Company’s disclosure in the Strategic Report on the Task 

Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting 
requirements, and related disclosures in the financial statements

 – non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs)
 – consideration of the potential implications of the UK BEIS White 

Paper: Restoring Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance 
and the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) consultation on the 
UK Corporate Governance Code

The Committee is responsible for considering the significant areas of 
complexity, management judgement and estimation in relation to the 
financial statements. Set out in the table below are the significant 
areas of accounting judgement or management estimation and a 
description of how the Committee concluded that such judgements 
and estimations were appropriate.

Areas of significant accounting  
judgement and estimation

Carrying value of goodwill

The Group undertakes a formal goodwill 
impairment exercise for its cash-generating 
units at least once a year in accordance 
with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, based 
on the most recent approved budget and 
financial plan.

Tax

The Group operates in multiple tax 
jurisdictions and is subject to the rules of 
their various taxation authorities. Due to the 
complexity and changing nature of tax rules 
and transfer pricing across multiple tax 
jurisdictions, a degree of judgement is 
required in determining levels of tax 
recognised in the financial statements.

Strategic portfolio review

The Group has continued its strategic 
portfolio review of non-core activities to 
allow the focus of its resources on its core 
operations, which in the year resulted in the 
exit from several countries, including Central 
and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Slovakia and Romania), and the 
sale of a business, site closures, and contract 
renegotiations and terminations in the UK.

Post-employment benefits

The Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes are assessed half-yearly in 
accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. 
The present value of the defined benefit 
liabilities is based on assumptions determined 
following independent actuarial advice.

Going concern and viability

The going concern and viability statements 
were reviewed in detail.

How each was addressed by the Committee

The Group tests at least annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in 
accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, based on the most recent budgets and plans 
that have been formally approved by management.

The recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill involves the use of assumptions, including 
operating cash flow forecasts, long-term growth rates and discount rates. The Committee 
reviewed the key assumptions used to assess the recoverability of goodwill, including the 
higher discount rates caused by the increases in market interest rates in the year, and 
concluded that these were appropriate. The Committee noted that the headroom in the UK 
cash-generating unit is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. The 
Committee reviewed the goodwill impairment assessment disclosures and concluded that 
these were appropriate.

The Committee oversaw the development and reporting of the Company’s and the Group’s 
direct tax strategy. It assessed the impact of changes in the approach of governments to tax 
and discussed with management the key judgements made. The Committee also reviewed 
disclosures on contingent tax liabilities. KPMG, the external auditor, reported on significant 
provisions to the Committee. Based on the above, the Committee was satisfied that the level 
of tax provisioning and tax disclosures for the Group remained appropriate. 

The Committee considered the accounting consequences of the ongoing strategic portfolio 
review. This included the derecognition of assets and recoverability of deferred consideration 
for exited business. In relation to the review of non-core activities in the UK, the Committee 
reviewed the key judgements made by management, including provisions for impairment 
made in respect of ongoing obligations for closed sites, and for the related contract 
negotiations and terminations. The external auditor reported on these matters to the 
Committee. The Committee was also satisfied with management’s disclosure of the charge 
outside underlying operating profit on the basis that it was a material, unusual item and did 
not arise in the ordinary course of trading.

The Committee considered management’s valuation of the liabilities of the Group’s post-
employment benefit schemes, which is sensitive to actuarial assumptions, including discount 
rates, inflation, pension and salary increases, and mortality and other demographic 
assumptions. The Committee considered the external auditor’s assessment of the 
reasonableness of the assumptions, together with a comparison of the assumptions to those 
made by other companies, and was satisfied that the assumptions made with respect to 
post-employment benefits were appropriate.

The assumptions and evidence supporting the going concern and viability statements were 
reviewed and challenged by the Committee. Financial models of scenarios prepared by 
management over the assessment periods were considered by the Committee, as well as the 
liquidity position of the Group, the principal risks, the level of headroom against committed 
facilities and compliance with financial covenants attached to issued debt. Having considered 
in detail the analysis undertaken and the assessment of the external auditor, the Committee 
was satisfied that the going concern and viability statements were appropriate.

Audit Committee report continued

Fair, balanced and understandable Annual Report 
and Accounts

The Code provides that the Board should provide a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s position and prospects 
in its Annual Report and Accounts. At the Board’s request, the 
Committee has reviewed the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts to 
determine whether it considers the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, meets this standard and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. The Committee has 
concluded that this requirement has been met.

Throughout the Annual Report and Accounts, performance during the 
year is presented against a mix of financial and non-financial KPIs, 
which the Board and executive management consider best reflect the 
Company’s strategic priorities. The Committee has considered these 
KPIs and is satisfied that the information that has been selected by 
the Board and executive management will help to convey an 
understanding of the performance and the culture of the business, 
and the drivers which contribute to its success, and will be of 
interest to stakeholders.

Presentation currency

During the year, the Committee was updated on the proposal to 
change the Group’s presentation currency from sterling to US dollars 
from 1 October 2023 so as to provide greater transparency of the 
Group’s performance and to reduce foreign exchange volatility. 
The Committee also noted the planned timeline for implementation 
and reviewed the approach and the implementation plan. 
Additionally, the Committee considered the external reaction to the 
change, including communications. Having considered these matters, 
the Committee recommended the change of presentation currency to 
the Board for approval.

Risk management and internal controls

The Committee is responsible for reviewing the Company’s internal 
financial controls and internal control and risk management systems. 
During the year, the Committee:

 – received and discussed regular reports summarising: the Group’s 
risk management activities; the identification of any changes to 
principal risks including the impact of macroeconomic and 
elevated geopolitical factors; and emerging risks such as the 
development of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the 
actions taken to mitigate these risks; the findings from internal 
audits, and the status of resultant actions agreed with management

 – reviewed and approved the internal audit plan for 2024 and 

monitored delivery of the 2023 plan

 – reviewed the resources, terms of reference and effectiveness of the 

Internal Audit and Risk Management function

 – reviewed arrangements for the Group’s workforce/stakeholders to 

raise concerns in confidence about possible improprieties in 
financial reporting or other matters (via Speak Up, We’re Listening), 
including arrangements for investigating such matters

 – received presentations from the Group Head of E&I in relation to 
business integrity risks and Speak Up, We’re Listening cases and 
investigations in relation to theft and fraud 

 – received regular reports from the Head of Group Tax on tax policies, 

uncertain tax positions, and tax audits and inquiries

 – received updates on the activities of the Regional 

Governance Committees

 – received updates in relation to cyber-security arrangements
 – considered the assurance provided over the implementation of new 
enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in the Group in the US 
and Europe

The Audit Committee reviews the integrity of any material 
financial statements made by the Company. It monitors and conducts 
a robust review of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
systems, accounting policies and practices and certain compliance 
controls (including key financial controls) as well as the Company’s 
statements on internal control, before they are agreed by the Board 
for inclusion in the Annual Report and Accounts.

Management have defined a set of key internal controls over 
financial reporting which must be complied with by all countries. 
During the year, these key internal controls over financial 
reporting have been updated by the Group Financial Control team 
to ensure compliance with best practice, regulations and standards. 
These updates were reviewed by the Committee. Compliance with 
the key internal controls over financial reporting is tested by Group 
Internal Audit annually for the Group’s top 10 countries and on a 
rotational basis for other countries, and the results are reported 
to the Committee.

In accordance with the guidance set out in the FRC’s Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting 2014, and in the Code itself, the Group has 
established a risk management framework. This has been in place 
for the full financial year and up to the date on which the financial 
statements were approved. The framework is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic 
objectives, to safeguard the Group’s assets against material loss, to 
fairly report the Group’s performance and position, and to ensure 
compliance with relevant legislation and regulation including that 
related to social, environmental and ethical matters. The framework 
provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Further details of the Group’s risk management 
framework and principal risks are set out on pages 24 to 30.

The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the risk 
management framework. As part of this process, Group companies 
submit biannual certificates of assurance to the Group CFO on 
internal control and risk management matters. The Group CFO 
summarises these submissions for the Audit Committee, and the 
Chair of the Audit Committee reports to the Board on any matters 
that have arisen from the Committee’s review of the way in which 
risk management and internal control processes have been applied. 
The Committee annually reviews and considers the effectiveness of 
Compass’ approach to risk management and any changes to the 
risk policy. The Committee and the Board remain satisfied that the 
Company’s risk management framework continues to operate 
effectively and provides the necessary flexibility without compromising 
the integrity of risk management and internal control systems.

Whistleblowing, anti-bribery and fraud

The Audit Committee receives updates on any allegations of theft or 
fraud in the businesses, with individual updates being given to the 
Committee, as needed, in more serious cases. The Group’s new 
Business Integrity Policy (BIP) and recently refreshed Code of 
Business Conduct (CBC) strictly prohibit any involvement in theft or 
fraudulent activities whatsoever. The BIP sets out the expectations for 
risk assessing, reporting and documenting any fraud, in accordance 
with local requirements, and the Speak and Listen Up Policy. It also 
sets out how allegations and incidents are to be followed up such as 
through investigations conducted by Internal Audit, E&I or Legal 
teams. Fraud and theft reports are consolidated at Group level, and 
feed into the regular updates presented to the Committee. 

The Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees the continued 
development of the Group’s overall E&I programme, the training of 
employees on key business integrity risk areas and the way in which 
management obtains assurance in this area, including the annual 
self-certification process via E&I’s pledge and declaration. More 
information on the CBC, and the Speak Up, We’re Listening 
programme is set out on pages 13 and 14.

The CBC is available on the Company’s website,  
www.compass-group.com/en/who-we-are/ethics-and-integrity

Information systems and cyber-security risk

Information systems and cyber-security risk continues to pose a threat 
to the Group and remains a principal risk. The Committee received 
reports from the Group CIO on progress made on the implementation 
of the IT controls framework, including enhanced security operations, 
threat intelligence, the Group’s response to the increased threat of 
ransomware, and the continued drive on cyber-risk awareness and 
training across the Group. 

In November 2022, the Committee reviewed IT systems back up and 
restoration, crisis management and phishing benchmark data, and 
the Group CIO briefed the Committee on the resilience of the Group’s 
technology estate. The briefing provided the Committee with a more 
detailed overview which included business continuity, the IT control 
framework, cyber insurance, public cloud resilience and the 
arrangements to protect information assets of the greatest value to the 
Group. The Committee reflected on the arrangements in place and the 
steps taken to further enhance the Group’s resilience capabilities, and 
its ability to respond to cyber-attacks and noted the priorities for 2023.

At its meeting in May 2023, the Committee considered examples of IT 
security incidents that had occurred in the Group’s businesses 
together with the preventative measures and subsequent actions 
taken to limit the impact on operations. The Committee was also 
briefed on the outcome of a proactive ethical hacking exercise that 
had been conducted in conjunction with its cyber-security providers 
and advisers in over half of the Group’s top 10 countries in order to 
identify potential weaknesses. The Committee was advised that the 
exercise had identified some operational weaknesses which had been 
addressed and the solutions validated by the Group’s independent 
external adviser to ensure that the remedial actions had been 
appropriately implemented. The Group’s proactive efforts to limit 
exposure to phishing attacks were also discussed, including the roll 
out of additional technology, implementation of regular phishing 
simulations to help educate colleagues, the annual Cyber Awareness 
Week, and ongoing weekly advocacy messages from ‘cyber 
champions’ across the Group’s businesses.

At each meeting during the year, the Committee received updates 
from management in relation to the implementation of the ERP 
systems in Europe and North America.

In Europe, an ERP system is being introduced as part of a business 
transformation programme designed to improve consistency, 
efficiency and the working lives of unit managers and colleagues 
through the implementation of common data, processes and systems 
across finance, operations and procurement. The Committee 
reviewed with management the governance structures around the 
programme, the quality assurance plan focused on key risks, and the 
outcomes of assurance audits timed to inform key decisions. The 
Committee also monitored the progress of the roll out of the system 
and considered the output of post-implementation project validation 
and migration reviews.

In North America, a similar programme is being implemented to 
introduce an ERP system to simplify processes, create efficiencies 
and help improve data accuracy. The Committee reviewed and 
challenged the proposed governance and assurance arrangements 
around the programme to ensure that both the programmes were 
closely aligned and that lessons learned from the implementation in 
Europe were used to benefit the North America programme. The 
Committee monitored the progress focusing on timeline, costs and 
benefits, together with programme controls and assurance.

Internal audit

The Internal Audit team is led by the Group Director of Risk and 
Internal Audit who reports functionally to the Chair of the Audit 
Committee and operationally to the Group CFO. The purpose, scope 
and authority of the Internal Audit function are set out in its terms of 
reference which are approved by the Committee. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit function, including 
resources, plans and performance as well as the degree to which 
the function is free from management or other restrictions. To help 
the Committee gain assurance that the Internal Audit function is 
independent, the Committee meets with the Group Director of Risk 
and Internal Audit at least once a year without the presence of 
management. The Committee met with the Group Director of Risk and 
Internal Audit on two occasions during the year under review without 
the presence of management.

During the year, the Committee monitored the performance of Internal 
Audit. The Committee reviewed and approved the Group’s annual 
internal audit plan. The plan is designed with reference to the Group’s 
principal risks. Further information on the principal risks is available 
on pages 26 to 30. The Committee receives regular updates on 
progress against the plan and Internal Audit’s findings, together 
with management actions taken to address recommendations. 
The Committee recognises that IT risks and technology complexity 
have increased significantly in recent years due to cyber-security 
threats, data privacy regulations, IT governance and AI, and has 
supported the expansion of the Internal Audit function with the 
addition of IT audit capability.

The Committee remains satisfied that the Internal Audit function 
has the necessary resources, objectivity, and competency to fulfil its 
mandate. It has also satisfied itself that the Internal Audit function 
has adequate standing and is free from management influence or 
other restrictions.

Audit Committee report continued

External audit

External auditor

The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Company’s policy on external 
audit and has oversight responsibility for monitoring the external 
auditor’s independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical, 
professional and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee is 
responsible for the re-tendering selection process and recommends 
the appointment, reappointment and removal of the Company’s 
external auditor, and considers the risks associated with its withdrawal 
from the market in its risk evaluation and planning.

The Audit Committee also reviews and sets the terms, areas of 
responsibility and scope of the audit as set out in the external auditor’s 
engagement letter including the overall work plan for the forthcoming 
year, together with the associated fee proposal and cost-effectiveness 
of the audit.

Effectiveness of the external audit process

During the year, the Committee considered the effectiveness of the 
external audit process, whether the agreed audit plan for the financial 
year ended 30 September 2022 had been fulfilled, and the reasons for 
any variation from the plan. 

The Committee is committed to ensuring that Compass receives a 
high-quality and effective external audit. The Committee assessed 
the effectiveness of the external audit process through a number of 
methods, commencing with the identification of appropriate risks 
by the external auditor. These were reviewed by the Committee 
in the detailed external audit plan for the financial year ended 
30 September 2023 at the start of the audit cycle. The work 
performed on these risks by the auditor was used to test 
management’s assumptions and estimates. The effectiveness of 
the audit process in addressing these matters was assessed through 
the reports presented to the Committee at the half and full-year. 

The Committee also considered how and to what extent the auditor 
had exercised professional scepticism. During the audit of the Annual 
Report and Accounts, the auditor challenged management as to 
whether the disclosures in the financial statements were consistent 
with the narrative disclosures in the Strategic Report in relation to the 
impact of certain risks and, specifically, how the potential impact of 
climate change on the financial statements had been assessed. 
The auditor also challenged management’s approach to goodwill 
impairment testing and the appropriateness of actuarial assumptions 
used to estimate post-retirement benefit obligations, as well as other 
sources of estimation uncertainty, such as uncertain tax positions and 
accounting consequences of the ongoing strategic portfolio review. 
Management and the auditors engaged constructively in relation to 
the challenges raised and an unmodified opinion was issued by the 
auditor, which is set out on pages 132 to 143.

The review also included a formal evaluation process covering several 
aspects of the external audit. A wide range of internal stakeholders 
including Audit Committee members, regional finance directors and 
Group functions (including Internal Audit, Legal, Finance and Tax) 
and local finance directors (excluding countries not in scope for the 
KPMG LLP audit) completed questionnaires.

A detailed report on KPMG’s audit quality and effectiveness was 
presented to the Committee at its meeting in May 2023. The findings 
were considered and opportunities for improvement were discussed 
with KPMG. In summary, the Committee concluded that the external 
audit process continued to be of a high quality and remained effective.

Independence of external auditor

Zulfikar Walji was the Senior Statutory Audit Partner for the year under 
review. To ensure the independence and objectivity of the Company’s 
external auditor and the integrity of the audit process, key members 
of the external audit team periodically rotate off the Company’s audit. 
Additionally, the recruitment of senior employees from the Company’s 
auditor is not permitted for a period of at least two years after they 
cease to be involved in the provision of services to the Company. 
The audit of the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts will be Mr Walji’s 
final audit for Compass Group PLC. Mr Walji will be succeeded by 
Mr Jonathan Downer as the Senior Statutory Audit Partner.

In assessing the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, 
the Committee takes into account the assurances and information 
provided by the external auditor at the planning stage of the audit, 
including a written disclosure of the relationships (including the 
provision of non-audit services) that could have an impact on the 
external auditor’s independence and objectivity, and the safeguards 
put in place to address such concerns. As part of this process, the 
Committee receives a statement from the external auditor advising 
that all partners and staff annually confirm their compliance with 
KPMG’s ethics and independence policies and procedures 
including, in particular, that they have no prohibited shareholdings, 
and their ethics and independence policies are fully consistent 
with the requirements of the FRC Ethical Standard. The Committee 
has concluded that KPMG was independent of the Group for 
the year under review.

Non-audit fees

The Company operates a policy on non-audit-related fees which 
it reviews annually and under which it discloses the ratio of audit 
to non-audit fees paid in each financial year. The Committee monitors 
the level of non-audit work which the external auditor can perform, to 
ensure that any provision of non-audit services falls within the scope 
of the agreed Non-Audit Work Policy and does not impair the external 
auditor’s objectivity or independence. The Group’s policy on non-audit 
services is aligned with the FRC’s 2019 Ethical Standard for auditing 
practices for what is permissible for public interest entities, and no 
services outside this are approved by the Committee. Engagements 
for non-audit services that are not prohibited are subject to formal 
approval by the Audit Committee based on the level of fees involved. 
Non-audit services that are pre-approved are either routine in nature 
(e.g. the half-year limited review) with a fee which is not significant in 
the context of the audit or are other audit-related services. Within the 
constraints of applicable UK rules, the external auditor could 
undertake certain non-audit work. The provision of non-audit services 
within such constraints and the agreed policy is assessed on a 
case-by-case basis to ensure that the adviser best placed to 
undertake the work is retained. In accordance with the Group’s 
policies, the Group CFO approves individual non-audit services with 
fees up to £50,000 and non-audit services with combined fees up to 
£100,000. Audit Committee approval is sought for non-audit services 
exceeding these limits. 

Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

Audit fees paid in the year 

The total fees paid to KPMG in the year ended 30 September 2023 
were £8.0 million, of which £0.3 million related to non-audit work 
(2022: £7.1 million of which £0.3 million related to non-audit work). 
Having considered the non-audit work undertaken by KPMG LLP 
during the year, it was agreed by the Committee that the tasks 
undertaken represent permitted non-audit services (as set out in 
Section 5 of the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard 2019). The principal 
non-audit services provided by KPMG related to the half-year review of 
the Group’s interim financial report, and comfort letters in respect of 
government support schemes and comfort letters for the annual 
extension of the Euro Medium Term Note programme. The Committee 
believes that KPMG, as external auditor, was best placed to undertake 
these non-audit services and that the level of fees for these services 
did not adversely impact its integrity, objectivity or independence. 
Further disclosure on the non-audit fees paid during the year can be 
found in note 3 on page 156.

Statutory audit tender process

In accordance with its terms of reference and regulatory 
requirements, the Audit Committee ensures that at least once every 
10 years the external audit services contract is put out to tender. 
The Committee is responsible for the selection and appointment of 
the external auditor. It initiates and conducts any competitive tender 
process undertaken by the Company for the provision of external audit 
services and considers and makes recommendations to the Board, to 
be put to shareholders for approval at the Company’s AGM. 

The Committee confirms that for the year under review the Company 
complied with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
KPMG LLP was initially appointed as the Company’s external auditor 
in March 2014, succeeding Deloitte LLP. KPMG’s audit for the year 
ended 30 September 2023 is therefore its 10th year, and as a result, 
Compass was required to complete a formal tender process for a new 
auditor in advance of the audit for the financial year ending 2024. 

Summary of the statutory audit tender process

Compass announced its intention to commence a formal audit tender 
process in its 2022 Annual Report and that the outcome would be 
announced in due course, with a recommendation to be made to 
shareholders at the 2024 AGM.

The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for the audit tender 
process. At its meeting in September 2022, the Committee agreed the 
stages of the process, timeline, and selection criteria. 

The Committee’s key objectives throughout the tender process, and 
in making its recommendation to the Board, was to ensure that 
Compass appointed an audit firm that would provide a high-quality, 
effective audit. 

To ensure an effective and efficient tender process, the Audit 
Committee established a Sub-Committee comprising the Audit 
Committee Chair, and two other Audit Committee members, 
John Bryant and Arlene Isaacs-Lowe (the Sub-Committee), to meet 
with the candidate firms to consider the tender submissions and to 
receive presentations from them. The Sub-Committee was supported 
by the Group CFO, the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, and the Group Financial Controller who was responsible for 
coordinating the audit tender process. The Committee was kept up to 
date throughout the tender process by the Chair of the Committee.

The timeline of the process, which started in October 2022 (well in 
advance of the last possible date to ensure a wider choice of audit 
firms and partners), is set out below. The process was managed in 
such a way as to allow adequate time to consider the merits of the 
proposals of the candidate firms and recommend the preferred firm to 
the Board for appointment in advance of the commencement of the 
audit for the financial year ending 30 September 2024.

At the outset, before the request for proposal (RFP) was issued, the 
Audit Committee considered the FRC’s requirement for mid-tier 
external audit firms to be invited to tender for FTSE 100 audits. After 
careful consideration, the Committee concluded that those firms did 
not have a genuine prospect of success in the tender because they did 
not have the global reach and depth of experience to achieve a 
high-quality audit for a group of the scale and complexity of Compass. 
The Committee therefore concluded that only the ‘Big Four’ firms had 
the global reach and depth of experience to provide the appropriate 
level of audit services to Compass. 

Of the ‘Big Four’, two firms did not participate in the tender process. 
The first of these was considered to be conflicted due to the services it 
provides in relation to cyber security and tax advice, and the second 
declined to participate. Invitations to submit tender proposals were 
therefore extended to the two remaining ‘Big Four’ firms, which 
included the incumbent.

Written responses to the RFP were assessed by the core team against 
the following criteria:

 – audit quality 
 – audit approach, scope, and methodology 
 – the lead engagement partner
 – the engagement team: specifically, experience of working 

effectively together; technical accounting knowledge and, where 
relevant, experience of transitioning an audit

 – sector and global plc experience and understanding
 – approach to resolving issues or matters of judgement
 – sustainability credentials
 – independence
 – audit innovation
 – global coordination and communication
 – fees

Outcome of statutory audit tender process

Committee evaluation

The priorities set by the Committee as a result of last year’s external 
evaluation process were:

 – continuing to focus on meeting management, including time 

management, and ensuring sufficient time is spent on 
Committee priorities

 – continuing training, particularly with regard to TCFD and 
sustainability reporting, together with other corporate 
reporting changes 

 – further developing year-end reporting to support the Committee’s 

review of the integrity of financial controls

 – continuing positive engagement with the external auditor

These themes, together with the Committee’s regular programme of 
work, shaped the Committee’s agenda and were included in the 
principal activities during the year under review.

2023 evaluation 

During the year, an internal evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
Committee was conducted as part of the wider evaluation of the 
Board and its committees. 

Details can be found on page 96. 

The evaluation concluded that the Committee continued to 
operate effectively. 

The Committee will continue to focus on the following areas: 

 – audit and governance reforms including assurance over  

non-financial reporting; and

 – ESG and climate net zero disclosures

These matters, together with the regular work of the Committee, 
will inform the Committee’s agenda for the coming year.

Anne-Françoise Nesmes
Chair of the Audit Committee

20 November 2023

As described above, the two firms provided a written response to the 
tender RFP and presented their proposals to the Sub-Committee at 
meetings also attended by the Group CFO, Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary and Group Financial Controller in April 2023.
This provided an opportunity to explore the areas within the selection 
criteria, and to assess the quality of the key members of the candidate 
audit teams. 

The Sub-Committee considered the tender submissions and 
presentations from the audit teams and the extent to which they met 
the selection criteria.

The Sub-Committee agreed both proposals would deliver a 
quality external audit. Overall, the Sub-Committee concluded the 
incumbent was its preferred candidate due to the strength of the 
wider team, and significant understanding and tailored approach 
to the audit of the Group.

The Sub-Committee recommended to the Audit Committee that 
KPMG LLP be reappointed for up to 10 years in accordance with 
relevant legislation and regulations. The Audit Committee supported 
the Sub-Committee’s recommendation. 

At its meeting on 4 May 2023, the Board approved the Committee’s 
proposal to reappoint KPMG LLP as statutory auditor of the Company 
for the financial year ending 30 September 2024, subject to 
shareholder approval. 

There are no contractual obligations that restrict the Committee’s 
choice of auditor, the recommendation is free from third-party 
influence and no auditor liability agreement has been entered into.

KPMG has expressed its willingness to continue as auditor of the 
Company. Separate resolutions proposing KPMG LLP’s appointment 
and the determination of its remuneration by the Audit Committee will 
be proposed at the 2024 AGM.

The Committee would like to thank both firms for their professionalism 
and the quality of their submissions. 

Corporate governance reform

During the year, the Committee received regular updates from 
management and the external auditor on developments in relation to 
the FRC’s consultation on a new UK Corporate Governance Code and 
other legislative changes. In particular, the Committee received 
briefing notes on the consultation in general, and the proposed 
introduction of an Audit and Assurance Policy under the draft 
Companies (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2023. 

The Committee considered management’s plans to respond to these 
evolving requirements, including updates to the key internal controls 
over financial reporting. 

Subsequently, the Committee noted that the UK Department of 
Business and Trade (DBT) has withdrawn the draft Companies 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) (Amendment) Regulations 
2023 and the FRC has withdrawn certain proposed changes to the 
Code, which were part of the package of measures to implement the 
UK Government’s audit and corporate governance reforms. The 
Committee will continue to monitor developments in this area.

non-executive directors, the Chair of the Board, the Group Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) and the Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO). 

Biographies of Committee members can be found on pages 58 to 61. 
Members of the Committee are appointed by the Board following 
recommendation by the Nomination Committee.

The Committee meets at least three times a year. The quorum for a 
meeting is two, one of which must be an independent non-executive 
director. The Committee held three meetings during the year. 
Meeting attendance can be found in the table on page 69.

The Chair of the Committee reports to the Board on Committee 
activities and attends the AGM to respond to any shareholder 
questions that might be raised on the Committee’s activities.

Only members of the Committee have the right to attend Committee 
meetings. Other individuals, such as the Group Chief Commercial 
Officer (CCO), the Group Chief People Officer (CPO), Group Head of 
Ethics and Integrity (E&I) and external advisers, may be invited to 
attend all or part of any meeting, as and when appropriate. The Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary, who acts as Secretary to the 
Committee, attends all meetings of the Committee. Other members of 
senior management are invited to present such reports as are required 
for the Committee to discharge its duties.

The Committee is authorised to seek external legal or independent 
professional advice as it sees fit. The terms of reference of the 
Committee are reviewed annually to ensure they continue to be 
fit for purpose. They were last reviewed in September 2023. 
The review concluded that the terms of reference continue to 
reflect best practice.

A copy of the terms of reference can be found on our website, 
www.compass-group.com.

The Committee is responsible for overseeing, monitoring and making 
recommendations to the Board on the development, implementation 
and effectiveness of the Group’s People, Corporate Responsibility, 
Health, Safety and Sustainability (including climate change), E&I, and 
Stakeholder Engagement strategies. Examples of the Committee’s 
activities across these key themes during the year are set out in the 
pages that follow.

Health and safety

The health and safety (H&S) of the Group’s employees and consumers 
is a top priority for Compass and the Committee receives regular H&S 
reports from the Group CCO to enable it to monitor performance.

The Group has two key performance indicators (KPIs) linked to the 
H&S of colleagues and consumers: the Lost Time Incident Frequency 
Rate (LTIFR) and the Food Safety Incident Rate (FSIR). The Committee 
sets limits for these KPIs at the beginning of the year and monitored 
performance over the course of the year to enable it to assess the 
effectiveness of the controls in place to mitigate the occurrence of 
LTIFR and FSIR incidents across the businesses. Performance 
outcomes are linked to the executive director and senior management 
annual bonus plan, and the results for the financial year ended 2023, 
which the Committee is pleased to report are within the limits set at 
the start of the year, can be found on page 7. 

As part of the Group’s drive to continuously improve its safety culture, 
in September, the Committee considered and approved a move 
from the LTIFR H&S workplace performance measure to the 
Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) H&S workplace 
performance measure for the financial year ending 2024, reflecting 
the continuing maturity of Compass’ safety culture. TRIFR is generally 
considered to be a more holistic measurement as it includes all 
injury types, and from 2024 it will be used in place of LTIFR as a 
performance measure in relation to the annual bonus plan for 
executive directors and other senior management. Further details on 
the ESG measures in the annual bonus plan can be found in the 
Remuneration Committee report on pages 116 to 117 and 120.

Governance

Corporate Responsibility Committee report continued

At each meeting the Committee considers a safety moment relating to 
topical aspects of health or safety, or lessons learned from a recent 
incident. Each briefing aims to provide the Committee with a fuller 
understanding of the H&S matters faced by the businesses and how 
the lessons learned from such incidents are applied to mitigate the 
risk of a recurrence. In the financial year ended 2023, safety moments 
included the use of geothermal energy for cooking and the launch of a 
new global safety portal designed to support safety communities 
across Compass.

In addition to the regular safety moments, in November 2022, 
the Committee reviewed a deep-dive on safety performance in the 
Group’s largest business in North America with the Vice President of 
Risk Management. The Committee was briefed on the outcome of the 
North America business LTIFR and FSIR performance for the financial 
year ended 2022, which was within the limits set at the beginning of 
the year. The Committee also reviewed how, over time and through  
a period of considerable growth, the North America business had 
developed its people and risk management systems to create a  
more active approach to safety which provides management with 
data-driven insights and real-time reporting. 

The Committee also considered the safety focus areas for 2023 
designed to build on the active safety culture in the business. These 
areas included the introduction of predictive analytics, training for 
colleagues to further develop competency and capability, safety 
innovation and the assessment and further advancement of the 
Group’s safety culture. The Committee acknowledged the contribution 
of North America’s management and colleagues which had resulted in 
an industry-leading safety performance for 2022 when benchmarked 
against recognised external metrics. 

The regional financial performance of the North America business can 
be found on page 22. H&S performance results for the region for 
2023, which are linked to the annual bonus for the Chief Operating 
Officer, North America, can be found on page 117.

Ethics and integrity

The Committee oversees the Group’s E&I strategy, programme, 
policies and activities, and receives regular presentations and reports 
from the Group Head of E&I.

At its meeting in November 2022, the Committee received an update 
on the Group’s E&I programme of activities, implementation strategy 
and the positive progress made during the financial year ended 2022, 
which was reflected in the cultural indicators and insights gathered 
from pulse surveys. The output from the surveys and other programme 
performance indicators provided the Committee with further 
assurance that, overall, the programme continues to strengthen, 
adopting a prioritised, risk-based approach. 

A summary of the E&I priorities and forward plan for 2023 was 
reviewed by the Committee, which included activities to further 
embed Group policies and processes, continued implementation of 
key integrity controls, improvements in the management of higher-risk 
third parties, enhanced monitoring and oversight procedures, and 
continued measurement of the Group’s culture of integrity, and the 
effectiveness of its Speak Up, We’re Listening programme. The 
Committee was also briefed on the self-assessment risk review 
undertaken across all countries in the Group using a tool provided by 
an independent external law firm, which validated the design and 
priorities of the E&I programme, and identified opportunities for 
improvement. Additionally, Internal Audit carried out an assurance 
review of the Speak Up, We’re Listening arrangements, and concluded 
that they continue to operate effectively and remain fit for purpose. 

At its meeting in May 2023, the Committee approved the new 
Compass Code of Business Conduct (CBC) and recommended it to 
the Board for approval. The CBC sets out the expected behaviours for 
everyone working with, for, or on behalf of Compass, including 
temporary and contract staff, regardless of location, role or level of 
seniority and is underpinned by Compass’ corporate values which 
continue to shape and further embed a strong governance and ethical 
culture across the Group.

During the year, the Group E&I team continued to embed its refreshed 
strategy and priorities, partnering with a network of regional and 
country E&I leaders, who promote and support awareness initiatives 
and training campaigns, and lead on local E&I programme activities; 
and in September this year, the Committee reviewed the progress 
made during the year to further embed the E&I programme through 
the use of a clear and comprehensive policy framework. The 
Committee also reviewed the priorities for the year ahead which 
included continuing to embed third-party integrity due diligence as 
part of local processes, improving management of high-risk third 
parties, enhancing monitoring and oversight procedures, and 
optimising existing compliance tools and technologies.

Sustainability

Employee engagement

During the year, the Committee continued its focus on sustainability 
and climate-related matters. 

In November 2022, the Committee received a presentation from the 
Group CCO setting out the two-year roadmap for the development of 
the Company’s disclosures under the TCFD requirements, taking into 
account the FRC’s thematic review of TCFD disclosures and 
climate-related disclosures in financial statements. The Committee 
also considered other reporting frameworks, including the EU 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the US SEC Climate 
Disclosure Rules, and the International Sustainability Standards Board 
sustainability disclosure standards. 

During the year, the Committee reviewed with management the 
Group’s sustainability strategy including the plans to reach climate 
net zero by 2050. The Committee reviewed the progress made 
during the year on reducing the Group’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
The Committee also considered the Group’s key activities to reduce 
Scope 3 emissions which centred around food waste reduction, 
re-engineering menus and collaboration with suppliers. The 
Committee also received an update on progress on the UK&I 
business’ commitment to reach climate net zero by 2030, and 
reviewed the roadmap in detail. More detail of Compass’ progress 
on its sustainability strategy and net zero commitments can be 
found in the Purpose report on pages 38 to 44.

In September 2023, the Committee reviewed the Company’s 
proposed TCFD disclosures to be included in the 2023 Annual 
Report and Accounts.

In addition, the Committee received a training session led by the 
Sustainability team, external advisers and the Company’s external 
auditor on the wider ESG landscape, including forthcoming 
sustainability disclosure requirements. Further information  
can be found on page 73. 

To better understand and mitigate the Group’s food waste footprint, 
the use of food waste tracking technology has been expanded across 
the Group’s operations to help towards Compass’ commitment to 
halve food waste in its operations by 2030. Aligned to this 
commitment, the Group introduced a non-financial food waste 
performance measure related to the number of sites across the 
Group’s businesses adopting the technology for the financial year 
ended 2023. Achievement of the food waste performance measure 
is linked to 5% of the annual bonus of executive directors and senior 
management. The Committee is pleased to report that excellent 
progress has been made during the year with 7,943 sites globally 
now employing food waste tracking technology to record food waste.

More details on the Group’s sustainability initiatives, including 
information regarding the Group’s Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions is set 
out on pages 38 to 54.

People

Overseeing the development, implementation and effectiveness of the 
Group’s people policies, strategies, processes and initiatives 
continues to be an important aspect of the Committee’s work, and to 
assist the Committee, it receives regular reports and presentations 
from the Group CPO.

In November 2022, the Committee reviewed the results of the global 
employee engagement surveys conducted in the financial year ended 
2022, in which colleagues were asked to rate their experience of 
working at Compass. The surveys covered a wide range of topics 
including feeling valued, motivation, respect, teamwork, health and 
wellbeing, culture, and confidence in the Group’s leaders. The 
Committee noted the increase in participation rates and that 
engagement scores had remained stable since 2019 despite the 
significant impact of COVID-19 on people’s sense of wellbeing. The 
results gathered from the surveys were used to identify areas of focus 
for 2023 including inclusion, career management, reward and 
recognition, and wellbeing. The Committee was also advised of several 
initiatives across the Group to help support colleagues, including the 
provision of free or subsidised food, raising financial awareness and 
providing tools to help employees manage their finances, access to 
emergency funds, employee counselling and health and wellbeing 
support, flexible working options, and access to overtime working.

In the year, the Committee was also updated on the highlights of the 
US Your Voice employee engagement survey, noting the high 
participation rates. The outcome of the survey indicated to the 
Committee that engagement remained strong among US colleagues 
and that the people strategy for the region was having a positive 
impact. The Committee concurred with management’s view that the 
outcome was positive overall when taken in the context of the large 
number of new colleagues recruited and inducted to support the 
re-opening of the business following the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the year, the Committee reviewed summaries of the roundtable 
meetings which the DNED, Ireena Vittal had held with employees from 
across the Group’s businesses. Mrs Vittal shared observations from 
her meetings, noting that common themes included hiring and 
retention, solving issues through technology and the desire among 
colleagues to share best practices. The roundtable meetings revealed 
that, in the main, employees remain very engaged and are proud to 
work for Compass. 

Two further employee roundtables were held in the year, hosted by 
non-executive director, Arlene Isaacs-Lowe, one of which was in 
support of the UK&I’s Black Future Month, one of a series of 
initiatives in the Group held during the year to recognise and 
promote opportunities available to the diverse communities of 
talent across the Group. 

The data and views of employees gathered from the employee 
engagement surveys and other engagement mechanisms, 
together with feedback from the roundtable meetings held by 
Mrs Vittal, and Ms Isaacs-Lowe, help to ensure the Board is aware of 
the views and concerns of the workforce so that these are taken into 
account in the Board’s discussions and decision-making processes. 
More details of the meetings held by Mrs Vittal and Ms Isaacs-Lowe 
can be found on page 75.

Talent management strategies

In September, the Committee received a presentation on the Group’s 
talent management strategies and how these supported the Group’s 
growth ambitions and were key to the future success of the 
businesses. The Committee focused on the core pillars of the 
approach, namely: strengthening succession pipelines; developing 
diverse future leaders; and improving talent mobility.

Human rights, modern slavery and supply chain visibility 
and integrity

During the year, the Committee considered the work being done to 
further develop Compass’ approach to mitigating the risks of modern 
slavery in the Group’s businesses and supply chains. Notable matters 
reviewed included:

 – renewing Compass’ partnership with the Slave-Free Alliance to help 
further improve due diligence processes, address salient human 
rights risks and provide support and advice regarding modern 
slavery and human trafficking

 – increasing employee awareness of human rights and modern 

slavery risks through the Group’s E&I programme training, which is 
being undertaken on a ‘risk to role’ basis to better detect, address 
and prevent modern slavery in the Group’s businesses and their 
supply chains

 – continuing to expand the cross-functional Human Rights Working 
Group to include representatives from all regions of the Group

 – hearing from the Group Director for Employment, Equity and Social 
Impact, responsible for collaboratively driving improvements in the 
Group’s human rights programme design and implementation 
globally, and receiving a presentation on the ongoing work to further 
the Group’s human rights agenda

 – working with Earthworm Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation, to 
map social and environmental risks within the fresh tomatoes and 
canned tuna supply chains in the UK and US

 – ongoing implementation of Compass’ Global Supplier Code of 
Conduct across the Group’s businesses setting out the ethical 
standards, principles, expectations, and behaviours expected from 
Compass’ supply chain partners

 – rolling out the Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) across 
additional countries to further extend due diligence and risk 
mapping processes

 – the formation of a new Group Supply Chain Risk Management 

(SCRM) Committee, whose remit is to further develop and embed a 
strategic framework and integrated approach to SCRM including 
mitigating human rights risks in the supply chain

The Committee reviews the Group’s Human Rights Policy every year to 
ensure that it remains fit for purpose and is aligned to the Group’s 
people, purpose and performance strategy. In 2023, the Committee 
considered proposed changes to the policy to improve its alignment 
with stakeholder feedback and expectations, as well as reinforcing the 
Group’s commitments to respecting human rights and its broader ESG 
ambitions. The Committee considered and subsequently 
recommended the revised Human Rights Policy to the Board for 
approval, which the Board approved.

The Committee also considered the Company’s Modern Slavery Act 
(MSA) statement for 2022 and concluded that the MSA statement 
reflected the progress made in the year and met the requirements  
of section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The Committee 
recommended the MSA statement to the Board for approval,  
and the Board approved the statement.

Copies of Compass’ 2022 Modern Slavery Act statement and the 
Company’s Human Rights Policy are available on our website,  
www.compass-group.com.

The 2023 MSA will be published on our website in December 2023.

Stakeholder engagement

During the year, the Committee considered the Group’s stakeholder 
engagement activities with clients, consumers, suppliers, 
communities and NGOs, including key areas of focus, noting that 
sustainability was a common theme among stakeholder groups. In 
addition to the areas of focus, the Committee reviewed the purpose 
and methods of engagement with stakeholders.

Information on the approach to stakeholder engagement, including 
how the Board is appraised of the views of the Company’s 
stakeholders, and how the matters set out in section 172 of the 
Companies Act 2006 have been considered in Board discussions and 
decision making, is set out on pages 74 to 81.

Engagement with the Group’s employees is described on page 75 and 
in more detail in the People report on pages 36 and 37.

Committee evaluation

The priorities identified by the Committee following last year’s external 
evaluation process were:

 – continuing to focus on the timing and structure of meetings to 
ensure appropriate focus on the wide range of issues in the 
Committee’s remit

 – continuing training and education for Committee members
 – monitoring the roadmap and performance against targets designed 
to help the Company achieve its climate net zero commitments

These themes, together with the Committee’s regular programme of 
work, shaped the Committee’s agenda and were included in the 
principal activities during the year.

2023 evaluation

The outcome of this year’s internal evaluation of the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee confirmed that the Committee continued to 
function effectively. 

No specific areas were identified that required significant improvement. 
However, recognising the increasing importance of ESG to 
stakeholders, it was agreed that in the coming year, the Committee 
would continue to focus on ESG matters including, in particular:

 – sustainability and climate reporting
 – H&S 
 – DE&I
 – supply chain risk

These matters, together with the regular work of the Committee will 
inform the Committee’s agenda for the coming year.

Governance

Board succession planning

Ian Meakins was appointed Chair of the Committee in December 2020. 
Membership comprises the Chair of the Committee and all the 
non-executive directors. Biographies of Committee members can be 
found on pages 58 to 61. Members of the Committee are appointed by 
the Board. The Board considers each member of the Committee 
(except the Chair of the Board who was independent on appointment) 
to be independent in accordance with the criteria set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the Code).

The Committee meets at least twice a year. The quorum for a meeting 
is three, of which the majority must be independent non-executive 
directors. The Committee held four meetings during the year. Meeting 
attendance can be found in the table on page 69. The Chair of the 
Board acts as Chair of the Committee, except when the Committee is 
dealing with the succession of the Chair of the Board. On these 
occasions, the meetings will usually be chaired by the Senior 
Independent Director (SID). The Chair of the Committee reports to 
the Board on Committee activities and attends the AGM to respond 
to any shareholder questions that might be raised on the 
Committee’s activities.

Only members of the Committee have the right to attend meetings. 
Other individuals, such as the Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 
the Group Chief People Officer (CPO) and external advisers may be 
invited to attend all or part of any meeting, as and when appropriate. 
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, who acts as 
secretary to the Committee, attends all meetings of the Committee.

The Committee is authorised to seek external legal or independent 
professional advice as it sees fit. The terms of reference of the 
Nomination Committee are reviewed annually to ensure that  
they continue to be fit for purpose. They were last reviewed in 
September 2023. The review concluded that the terms of reference 
continue to be fit for purpose. 

A copy of the terms of reference can be found on our website,  
www.compass-group.com.

Succession planning is a core element of the Committee’s work. 

When assessing succession plans for the Board, the Committee 
considers and evaluates the skills, knowledge and experience of its 
directors to ensure that the Board and its committees are well placed 
to discharge their duties, considering the need for diversity to reflect a 
broad range of backgrounds, experience and views. 

The tenure of independent non-executive directors is also reviewed 
regularly to facilitate future refreshing of the Board and to maintain an 
appropriate balance. From these reviews, the Committee determines 
the skills, experience, and attributes for new appointees to ensure the 
Board and its committees continue to operate effectively.

During the year, the Committee reviewed Board succession plans over 
the medium to long term. During this assessment, it considered, the 
structure, size and composition of the Board taking into account the 
requirements of the Code, and the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
(FCA) Listing Rules. A new non-executive director, Leanne Wood, was 
appointed during the year, and more detail is provided on page 94. 

Board appointment process

Procedures for appointing new directors are set out in the 
Committee’s terms of reference. The appointment process is led by 
the Chair of the Board, except where the appointment is for their 
successor, when it is usually led by the SID. 

When appointing a new Chair of the Board, the process includes an 
assessment of the time commitment expected, recognising the need 
for the Chair of the Board to be available in the event of a crisis.

Before an appointment of a director is made, the Nomination 
Committee agrees a candidate specification setting out the role and 
capabilities required. The Board promotes an environment which is 
supportive of individuals from diverse backgrounds, and in identifying 
suitable candidates, the Committee:

 – uses open advertising or the services of external advisers to 

Committee activities during the year

facilitate the search

The Nomination Committee is responsible for ensuring the 
composition and structure of the Board remains effective, balanced 
and aligned to the Company’s strategic priorities. In practice, this 
involves overseeing the nomination, induction, evaluation and orderly 
succession of directors. The Committee also ensures the Group’s 
governance facilitates the appointment and development of a diverse 
pipeline of effective talent that can deliver shareholder value over the 
long term. Examples of the Committee’s activities during the year, are 
set out in the pages that follow.

 – considers candidates from different genders and a wide range 

of backgrounds

 – considers candidates on merit and against objective criteria, 

bearing in mind the benefits of diversity on the Board

 – ensures that appointees have enough time to devote to the position, 

considering any other significant commitments

94 

Governance

Nomination Committee report continued

Depending on the strategic and succession plans of the Company, 
where appropriate, the Company will expand its search to consider 
individuals who may not have direct PLC experience, but who have 
experience of leading complex, global-scale organisations. The 
Committee believes that this broad approach ensures the best 
possible chance of attracting a diverse pool of candidates.

The Committee considers the selection and reappointment of 
directors carefully before making a recommendation to the Board. 
Non-executive directors and the Chair of the Board are generally 
appointed for an initial three-year term, which may be extended for a 
further two three-year terms. Reappointment is not automatic at the 
end of each term.

Appointment of new directors

Non-executive directors

During the year, the Committee launched a recruitment process to 
facilitate the appointment of two additional non-executive directors in 
support of the Board’s succession plans and the Group’s strategic aims. 
The Committee was also mindful of the FCA’s Listing Rule LR9.8.6(9)
(a)(i) which sets a target for listed companies of 40% female 
Board membership.

The selection process was led by the Chair of the Board who was 
assisted by the Group CPO and Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary. The Committee also used the services of an executive 
search firm to identify suitable candidates, Egon Zehnder (EZ). EZ is 
used from time to time by the Company for the recruitment of senior 
executives. It is independent of and has no other links with the 
Company or its directors.

Position specifications were prepared by EZ in conjunction with the 
Committee setting out the desired attributes, experience and personal 
style for the successful candidates, which enabled EZ to formulate its 
search strategy. To ensure the best possible chance of attracting a 
diverse pool of candidates the search considered individuals who did 
not have direct PLC experience, but who possessed experience of 
leading complex, global-scale organisations. Potential candidates 
were also required to demonstrate that they had sufficient time 
available to devote to the role.

In executing its search strategy for the two non-executive directors, 
and to ensure a diverse range of candidates, EZ identified a wide pool 
of potential candidates. From this, a long list was compiled and 
following further review, a number of individuals were profiled and 
considered by the Company. A short list was drawn up and seven 
candidates were interviewed by the Chair and CPO before progressing 
to the second selection stage of interviews with the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and Group CEO. Candidates, who 
were considered to best match the role requirements, were put 
forward to meet with the SID and other members of the Board. After 
detailed discussions and careful consideration, the Nomination 
Committee concluded and recommended to the Board that 
Leanne Wood be appointed to the Board with effect from 4 May 2023, 
which the Board approved. Leanne was considered to meet the brief 
very favourably. In addition to her people specialism, Leanne brings 
wider strategic and operational experience in global organisations and 
her people philosophy is a strong cultural fit with Compass.

The Company also offered a role to a second female candidate who 
did not accept the position. The Company is continuing its search 
in the coming year and hopes to meet all the FCA’s targets by the 
end of 2024.

Executive directors

In September 2023, Gary Green informed the Board that he wished to 
retire as Group Chief Operating Officer (COO), North America and as a 
director of Compass Group PLC and it was agreed that he would step 
down from the Board on 30 November 2023.

Through the Board and Executive Committee succession planning 
processes, the Committee identified Palmer Brown as the preferred 
and natural candidate to succeed Gary Green given his extensive 
knowledge of the contract catering industry and his deep financial 
expertise which he had demonstrated over the last two years in the 
role of Group CFO. The Committee also recognised his prior 
experience with the US business which he joined in 2001 where he 
played a central role as a member of the executive team and had been 
responsible for many strategic acquisitions and disposals for the 
Group. The Committee recommended the appointment of 
Palmer Brown as the Group COO, North America and this was 
approved by the Board with effect from 1 December 2023.

The Committee also considered candidates to succeed Palmer Brown 
as Group CFO. Again, through the Board and Executive Committee 
succession planning processes, the Committee identified 
Petros Parras as the preferred candidate. The Committee considered 
Mr Parras’ strong performance as Regional Finance Director for 
Europe and the Middle East where he had played a key role in the 
turnaround of the region, focusing on growth strategies, the operating 
model and core processes as well as the use of data analytics to drive 
better commercial outcomes. The Committee also considered his 
prior experience in fast-moving consumer goods businesses 
including Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Coty in Europe 
and North America in senior finance, operational and strategic roles. 
The Committee recommended the appointment of Petros Parras as 
the Group CFO and a director of Compass Group PLC and this was 
approved by the Board with effect from 1 December 2023. Petros 
will stand for election at the 2024 AGM.

Details of senior management succession planning are on page 95.

Induction process

On joining, new directors receive a formal, comprehensive and tailored 
induction programme designed to suit the individual’s needs and role. 
The induction includes meetings with senior management, the 
external auditor and external advisers, together with technical 
briefings and site visits, which facilitate an effective introduction 
to the Group’s businesses and culture. The induction process is 
structured in a way that ensures the new director has a strong 
foundation and the necessary information to understand the 
business, and to be effective in the role. 

Since her appointment, Leanne Wood has completed her personalised 
induction and is contributing effectively to Board and committee 
discussions. Leanne will stand for election at the 2024 AGM. 

Non-executive directors’ tenures and change in roles and 
responsibilities

Ian Meakins was appointed to the Board in September 2020 and as its 
Chair in December 2020. He completed his first three-year term in 
office during the year. In determining whether to renew Ian’s 
appointment for a further three-years, the Committee, chaired by the 
SID, considered the balance of perspectives, skills, experience and 
expertise needed on the Board to help the Company achieve its 
strategic goals. In arriving at a decision, the Committee considered 
Ian’s performance to date, his personal leadership qualities and the 
skills required to be a successful board chair, combined with the 
necessary experience, knowledge and insight to lead the Board in 
the next stage of the Group’s development. Ian’s capacity to devote 
sufficient time to his role at Compass was also considered. The 
Committee duly recommended the reappointment of Ian Meakins as a 
non-executive director and Chair of the Board for a further term of 
three-years, which was approved by the Board.

Carol Arrowsmith was appointed to the Board and as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee in June 2014. She stepped down as Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM 
and was succeeded in this role by John Bryant. To facilitate an orderly 
transition of the Remuneration Committee Chair, the Committee 
recommended that Carol continue as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee, which was approved by the Board. Carol completed her 
nine-year tenure in June 2023 and will retire from the Board following 
the conclusion of the 2024 AGM. The Board also approved the 
Committee’s recommendation that John Bryant, whom the Committee 
considered to be the most suitable candidate, be appointed to 
succeed Carol Arrowsmith as Chair of the Remuneration Committee at 
the conclusion of the 2023 AGM.

John Bryant joined the board of Flutter Entertainment plc in February 
2023 and became its Chair in September 2023. Recognising the time 
commitment required for this new role and his existing commitments, 
it was agreed by mutual consent that John would stand down as SID  
in July 2023 but continue as Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
and as a member of the Audit, Corporate Responsibility and 
Nomination Committees. 

The Board approved the Committee’s recommendation that 
Anne-Françoise Nesmes, who joined Compass in July 2018, succeed 
John as SID on the basis that she possessed the required level of 
seniority and experience to assume this senior Board position 
including a strong record of working within listed company boards 
together with an excellent knowledge of the associated UK regulatory 
and governance framework. 

During the year, the Corporate Responsibility Committee was updated 
on the work of the DNED and their role in bringing the voice of 
employees into the boardroom. Ireena Vittal has been DNED since 
2019. During her time in this role, Ireena has met with numerous 
employees from across the Group, listening to their insights and views 
and reporting them back to the Board. Ireena’s approach and 
personal style have ensured that employees have had the confidence 
to freely express any concerns and aspirations for Compass and their 
own development. The sessions have consistently been rated 
positively by participants and have provided the Board with a better 
understanding of the employee experience and have helped with the 
development of the Group’s People strategy. Ireena’s first term as 
DNED for a period of two years ended on 30 September 2021. She 
was subsequently reappointed as DNED for a second term which 
concluded on 30 September 2023. At its meeting in September, the 
Committee recommended to the Board that Ireena’s term as DNED be 
extended until the end of her tenure as a director, which the Board 
approved. This will enable Ireena to further build on the trust and 
goodwill that has been established to date and to continue to bring the 
voice of employees into the boardroom. Details of this year’s 
engagement sessions are on page 75.

Senior management succession planning

The Committee oversees the development of a strong and diverse 
pipeline of high-calibre individuals capable of discharging executive- 
level responsibilities. The succession planning process includes a 
review of talent at senior level. This enables the Committee to monitor 
and evaluate the strength of the talent pipeline, its composition, its 
diversity and the training and development needs within the Group’s 
senior leadership.

During the year, the Committee focused on succession 
planning for the Group’s North America business and the 
Group Executive Committee.

At its meeting in November 2022, the Committee reviewed the 
succession plans for the North America business with the Group COO, 
Group CPO and the CPO for North America. The Committee focused 
on the talent pipelines and plans in place relating to executive 
functional and operational roles, and senior leadership roles in each 
business sector, which were designed to ensure business continuity 
and to support sustainable growth. The Committee received an 
update from the CPO North America on the approach to recruiting, 
developing and retaining talent, together with an update on DE&I 
initiatives designed to ensure that there are diverse talent pipelines in 
place reflecting the diversity of the consumers and communities 
served by the North America business.

In connection with the Executive Committee succession plan, the 
Committee arranged for non-executive directors to have one-to-one 
meetings with some of the potential executive succession candidates. 
The meetings provided participating Committee members, 
particularly those who had recently joined Compass, with an 
opportunity to get to know succession candidates and to assess the 
Group’s executive succession plan and its alignment to the Group’s 
strategic and DE&I ambitions. 

In September, the Committee reviewed the succession plans for 
the Executive Committee with the Group CEO and Group CPO. 
The Committee reviewed the talent pipeline and focused particularly 
on the individuals identified as near-term succession candidates and 
their development plans.

Diversity, equity and inclusion

Board diversity and inclusion

At Board level, the approach to appointing new directors reflects the 
Committee’s objective to ensure there is always an appropriate 
balance of experience and backgrounds on the Board. Great 
emphasis is placed on ensuring that Board membership embodies 
diversity in its broadest sense. For this reason, members of the Board 
are drawn from a wide range of disciplines, industries and cultures.

The Board Diversity Policy, is available on our website, 
www.compass-group.com.

As reported on page 65, the FCA’s Listing Rules now set board 
diversity targets that at least 40% of the board are women, at least one 
of the roles of CEO, CFO, Chair and SID is held by a woman, and at 
least one director is from a minority ethnic background.

The Company has met all of the above targets, except the target to 
have 40% of Board membership represented by women. Following the 
appointment of Leanne Wood in May, 38% of the Board members are 
women, versus 33% last year. The Committee is aware that the 
percentage will return to 33% when Carol Arrowsmith steps down from 
the Board at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM in February 
2024, and will endeavour to redress the balance to enable the 
Company to comply with this requirement by the end of 2024. 

Group diversity, equity and inclusion

The Committee also reviews the Group’s policy on workforce DE&I, 
and its objectives and links to strategy. 

During the year, the Committee received an update on the Group’s 
DE&I activities from the Group CPO and the Group Talent and 
Capability Director. The workstreams being undertaken across 
the Group to recruit, develop and retain a diverse talent pool were 
considered, including the strategy to support the ambition of 
creating lifetime opportunities and a workforce representative of the 
consumers and communities served by Compass. The Committee 
noted progress being made to increase gender diversity, and the 
structured and broad approach and actions being taken, which varied 
based on geography and culture.

Governance

Nomination Committee report continued

The Committee supports the initiatives taking place across the 
Group’s businesses to improve DE&I, including work to further 
strengthen the pipeline of women through managed career paths, 
improved access to opportunities and the removal of barriers 
to progression. 

More details on the Group’s DE&I initiatives can be found on pages 
32 to 37. Information on Board and Executive Committee gender and 
ethnicity can be found on page 65. Gender diversity of Executive 
Committee direct reports can be found on page 36.

Time commitment, and training and development 

In line with its terms of reference, the Committee performed an annual 
review of the time required from the Chair of the Board, SID and 
non-executive directors to perform their duties. As part of this process, 
the Committee reflected on directors’ attendance at meetings and 
their availability at other times during the year. 

In consultation with the Chair of the Board, the Committee also 
considered the training that had been received by directors in the 
year, including the training session led by the Sustainability team, 
the external advisers and the Company’s external auditor on the wider 
ESG landscape, together with regulatory and governance updates 
from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary and other 
in-house and external subject matter experts and advisers. Future 
training needs are regularly considered and addressed as required. 

Board and committee evaluation

Last year, an independent external evaluation was conducted. 
Lintstock, which is independent of and has no other links with the 
Company or its directors, was selected to conduct the evaluation and 
the following priorities were identified for the financial year ended 
2023, which the Board has addressed during the year:

 – continuing focus on Board and Executive Committee succession 

planning for key leadership roles and future non-executive 
director succession

 – refocusing the forward agendas for the Board and committees 

considering the evolving environmental, societal and governance 
landscapes to promote and support strategic discussions

 – ensuring that directors have regular opportunities to meet in person 

and informally, to further develop relationships

2023 evaluation

The evaluation concluded that the Board and its committees 
continued to be effective and that each of the directors continued to 
contribute effectively to Board and Committee meetings.

As a result of the evaluation, a number of priorities were agreed for the 
Board in the year ahead:

 – incorporate the sector reviews into the regional reviews and agree 
the key strategic themes to be considered periodically in the year 
outside the annual Group strategy review

 – further enhance the quality of Board and committee materials by 
preceding all Board and Committee papers with an executive 
summary highlighting the action required, particular issues to be 
considered and any management dilemmas

These priorities, together with the regular work of the Board, 
will inform the Board’s agenda for the coming year.

The priorities identified from this year’s evaluation of the Audit, 
Corporate Responsibility and Remuneration Committees can be found 
on pages 88, 92 and 126 respectively.

Nomination Committee evaluation

The priorities identified by the Committee following last year’s external 
evaluation process were:

 – continuing to effectively support the Board in relation to Board and 

Executive Committee succession planning 

 – continuing the development of a diverse talent pipeline including 

gender, ethnicity and culture

These themes, together with the Committee’s regular programme of 
work, shaped the Committee’s agenda and were included in the 
principal activities during the year under review.

2023 evaluation

This year’s internal evaluation of the Nomination Committee 
confirmed that the Committee continued to be effective and identified 
the following priorities for the year ahead: 

 – as part of Executive Committee succession planning, review 

individuals’ progress against their development plans

 – review the talent strategy and how this supports the Group’s 

growth ambitions

This year, an internal evaluation was conducted with support 
from Lintstock. 

These matters, together with the regular work of the Committee will 
inform the Committee’s agenda for the coming year.

Ian Meakins
Chair of the Nomination Committee

20 November 2023

In May, based on a clear and comprehensive brief by the Chair of the 
Board and the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, 
questionnaires were prepared and distributed by Lintstock which 
focused on the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. The 
questionnaires, which took into account and built on the key themes 
which had emerged from the previous external evaluation, were 
completed by Board members. Members of the Executive Committee 
completed a separate questionnaire which sought their views on 
Board dynamics across five themes: exposure to the Board, 
relationships and communications, support and challenge, supporting 
growth, and suggestions for improving Board and Executive 
Committee dynamics. 

The outcome of the evaluation process (except the performance 
evaluation of the Chair of the Board, which was reviewed by the SID) 
was initially shared with the Chair of the Board and the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary followed by the other directors. 
All reports were subsequently presented to the Committee at its 
meeting in July.

Remuneration 
Committee report

John Bryant
Chair of the Remuneration Committee

Dear Shareholder

Listening to our shareholders

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (DRR) for the year ended 30 September 2023, 
my first report as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. I joined the 
Compass PLC Board in September 2018 and was appointed Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. 
I would like to thank my predecessor, Carol Arrowsmith, for her 
leadership and stewardship of the Committee over the past nine years.

Remuneration context

Compass is a business with over 550,000 employees operating in 
around 35 countries and around two-thirds of our revenues are 
generated in North America. 2023 was an exceptional year for 
Compass, establishing record levels of performance. The Group’s 
recovery surpassed its pre-pandemic levels of revenue, profit and 
cash. Our share price reached its highest level to date reflecting the 
market’s confidence in Compass and its leadership team. These 
results have been achieved against a backdrop of continued economic 
and political uncertainty.

Results this year have been strong in all areas, with revenues reaching 
£31 billion, underlying operating profit growth of 30% on a constant-
currency basis, underlying operating margin of 6.8%, net new 
business wins of 4.6% and a strong client retention rate of 96.5%. 
An ongoing focus on the importance of health and safety, including 
ethical sourcing, allergen management and food traceability, has 
continued to create opportunities for us.

We remain committed to halving our food waste by 2030 and have 
made excellent progress this year in the rollout of the tracking 
technology to achieve this, with just under 8,000 sites globally now 
tracking food waste. Early trends in our food waste reduction 
are promising.

However, the external landscape in which the Group operates 
continues to be challenging across our markets, with inflationary 
pressures being experienced in all markets and sectors. We reviewed 
our portfolio and have exited several countries as we continue to 
reshape our portfolio to focus on better growth opportunities in our 
larger, more developed markets.

Nevertheless, the strength of our balance sheet, along with our 
confidence in the prospects for the business, have provided us with 
the platform for strong returns to shareholders. We have declared a 
total dividend for the year of 43.1 pence. We also provided additional 
capital returns through the year in the form of share buybacks.

It is within this context that the implementation of the 2022 
Remuneration Policy (the 2022 Policy) during the year should 
be considered.

The Remuneration Committee has engaged extensively with 
shareholders over recent years, and since my appointment as Chair 
I have continued this open and transparent dialogue. My priority has 
been to develop relationships with investors and to spend time 
listening. I have met with many of our major shareholders to 
understand their views on our Remuneration Policy and its 
implementation, and I have directly heard a variety of opinions. 
This dialogue has been a continuation of the extensive engagement 
carried out by my predecessor, Carol Arrowsmith, during 2021 
and 2022, in respect of the 2022 Policy and other key 
remuneration decisions.

Although we were pleased that the majority of shareholders were 
supportive of the resolution to approve the 2022 DRR at the 2023 AGM, 
we are mindful that a notable minority opposed the resolution. 
During our engagement with shareholders in the lead-up to the 2023 
AGM, it was apparent that there was some concern related to the 
increase in the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) opportunity approved 
by shareholders at the 2022 AGM as part of the 2022 Policy and its 
subsequent implementation. However, concerns were not uniform 
across all major shareholders. For example, the largest single vote 
against the 2022 Policy at the 2022 AGM, and against the adoption of 
the Remuneration Report at the 2023 AGM, was influenced by a view 
that the incentive opportunity was not high enough. The prior votes 
against the remuneration resolutions should not therefore be 
interpreted as shareholders being universally opposed to the 
increased LTIP quantum, and in this context, because of this 
divergence of views amongst shareholders, building unanimous 
support across the register has been challenging. 

During our extensive consultation on the 2022 Policy, we engaged 
with our 100 largest shareholders, representing almost 90% of the 
issued share capital. In the lead-up to the 2022 AGM vote, we had 
good insight and understanding into the views of the vast majority of 
our shareholders. Although views were mixed, it was clear that the 
majority of shareholders were supportive of the increased LTIP 
quantum for executive directors. The Committee was, and remains, 
strongly of the view that the proposals were in the long-term interests 
of the Company and of its shareholders. We therefore decided to 
proceed with implementation following shareholder approval of the 
2022 Policy at the 2022 AGM. The dialogue with investors continued 
after the AGM during the spring of 2022, and in the lead-up to the 
2023 AGM. 

During engagement with investors following the 2023 AGM, many 
shareholders expressed the importance of the Committee’s 
commitment to not look at executive pay in isolation and to consider 
broader stakeholders in its deliberations. This approach is entirely 
aligned with that of Compass, and I was pleased to be able to share 
with some shareholders Compass’ broader approach to pay, which is 
set out on pages 105 to 106.

Governance

Remuneration Committee report continued

I was also interested to hear views on our incentive arrangements  
and the continued development of performance criteria for our plans. 
I have committed that as part of the next policy review the Committee 
will consider the measures linked to our incentive plans and consult 
further with shareholders regarding our proposals.

More recently, I also engaged with major shareholders to provide an 
update on the remuneration impact of the Board changes announced 
in September 2023. More details on our extensive engagement can be 
found on pages 103 to 104.

Our approach to executive remuneration

As a Committee, we believe our remuneration framework continues to 
incentivise the successful execution of our strategy and the delivery of 
returns to our shareholders. Compass has performed well against the 
market, the FTSE 100 Index and our sector consistently over the short, 
medium and long-term, save for the period in which the Company’s 
operations were impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Throughout this period we have managed to retain a stable and 
high-performing management team.

The perspectives of our major shareholders form an important part 
of the Committee’s deliberations, and I would like to reiterate my 
commitment to engaging with and listening to shareholders, 
particularly as we consider our 2025 Remuneration Policy, a process 
that has already begun as a result of this engagement. The Committee 
appreciates the willingness of our major shareholders to take a 
meaningful part in our deliberations. We acknowledge that executive 
pay is a topic that attracts strong and often differing opinions amongst 
investors, and we have continued to adopt an approach which is 
measured, fair, and promotes the sustainable delivery of the 
Company’s long-term strategy.

Consideration of the wider workforce and their views

Our people are at the heart of who we are and of what we do. We are 
focused on building an open culture in which our people can thrive, 
feel safe and feel valued for who they are and what they bring to 
Compass. In considering executive director remuneration, the 
Committee has regard to the wider workforce and is updated regularly 
on the remuneration policies and practices applicable to employees 
across the Group.

My fellow Remuneration Committee member, Ireena Vittal, is the 
Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce Engagement. 
During the year, Ireena continued her programme of engagement with 
employees to understand their views and experiences of working at 
Compass and what could be improved, and to take feedback on our 
approach to remuneration. These sessions provided Ireena with 
opportunities to hear directly from employees in an open environment, 
enabling the Board to better understand the differing views of our 
people. More information on Ireena’s discussions with employees can 
be found on page 75.

Earlier this year, as part of the UK & Ireland business’ Social Promise, 
it published its first ethnicity pay gap report, together with its gender 
pay gap report. The median gender pay gap reduced from 16.6% to 
12.6%, which is lower than the UK national average. Median pay for 
ethnic minorities was 7.9% higher than the Compass UK&I average, 
reflecting a higher representation of ethnic minority colleagues in 
higher paid roles. However, there is more work to do and action plans 
have been defined and communicated to address the challenges.

Our UK business is a Living Wage Recognised Service Provider, 
accredited by the Living Wage Foundation, meaning that its directly 
employed workforce are paid the Real Living Wage or above. 
Additionally, we continue to advocate for the Living Wage across 
our industry – encouraging clients and suppliers to pay the Living Wage.

Within our regions, we have continued to provide support and 
assistance in respect of employees’ health and financial wellbeing. For 
example, employees in some countries across the Group benefit from 
access to same-day pay, salary advances and financial education and 
support. Access to these benefits is particularly valued by employees 
who would ordinarily not have access to mainstream financial 
products and associated financial wellbeing support. UK employees 
also have an opportunity to become shareholders of Compass through 
an employee share scheme. More details of our approach to 
responsible pay are set out on page 105 to 106.

We continue to take a balanced and thoughtful approach to executive 
remuneration which is strongly aligned with UK corporate governance 
guidelines. We are acutely aware of the prevailing sensitivities 
surrounding executive remuneration arrangements and in recent 
years we have been particularly mindful of both protecting our 
front line employees and of shareholder views with regard to the 
potential exercise of positive discretion in respect of our long-term 
incentive plans. We are mindful that the base salary and total target 
remuneration of the Group CEO is in the lower quartile of the FTSE 30 
(excluding financial services), and the Committee will review this 
positioning as part of our next Remuneration Policy review. The 
pension cash allowances received by executive directors are in line 
with the maximum available to the majority of the wider UK workforce.

Whilst long-term incentive awards granted in the financial years ended 
2018, 2019 and 2020 lapsed following the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the pay structure has incentivised a strong recovery 
following the pandemic and has rewarded exceptional Company 
performance over the past financial year.

Remuneration outcomes in 2023

Bonus outcome – 100%

The exceptional financial results and operational performance noted 
above are reflected in bonus outcomes for the year. When determining 
the outcome for the annual bonus plan, in addition to the formulaic 
outcomes the Committee considered the business performance and 
operating environment and the wider stakeholder experience.

One-third of the bonuses earned for each executive director will be 
deferred into shares for a period of three years. The remainder of the 
bonus will be paid in cash. The cash payment and deferred bonus 
shares will be subject to malus and clawback provisions for a period of 
three years after payment/grant. No discretion has been exercised in 
respect of bonus payments for 2023. Full details of the targets and 
outcomes are set out on pages 116 to 117.

LTIP outcome – 100%

The 2020-2021 LTIP award was based on a three-year performance 
period ended 30 September 2023. Measures under this award were 
40% on Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), 40% on Adjusted Free 
Cash Flow (AFCF) and 20% on Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR).

Prior to grant, the Committee scaled back the award level by 30% of 
salary for the Group CEO and 25% of salary for other executive 
directors to reflect the fall in share price experienced as a 
consequence of the COVID-19 restrictions. The targets for this 
award were set in a highly uncertain environment and prior to the 
development and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. The extent to which 
the businesses would have the ability to reopen and to generate 
revenue was highly dependent upon prevailing and future government 
actions. In particular, cash flow forecasting in the first year of the 
performance period was particularly challenging. Although actual 
performance over the three-year period has outperformed these 
target ranges, our performance has far exceeded any reasonable 
forecast from when the targets were originally set.

The business delivered ROCE of 17.44% and AFCF of £2,890m over 
the three-year performance period ending 2023. Compass’ TSR 
performance was strong during the performance period, ranking 10th 
place out of the 73 companies in the comparator group, reflecting 
upper-quartile performance.

Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

All three of the performance conditions under the 2020-2021 award 
were met, and the award will vest in full. The Committee considered it 
important to undertake a comprehensive and holistic review of 
performance, both on an absolute and relative basis, to determine 
whether the payout level was consistent with the performance 
achieved and, in so doing, to apply a level of judgement to the vesting 
decision beyond the formulaic outcome. Given the strength of 
delivery, degree of outperformance versus peers, top-quartile TSR 
performance, and the progress made on multiple strategic priorities, 
the Committee is satisfied that the vesting of the award fairly reflects 
performance over the period. Despite the Company’s strong performance 
during the preceding three years, this is the first LTIP award to vest over 
the four-year period of recovery and growth.

Executive director changes

On 22 September 2023, we announced that Gary Green will step 
down from the Board on 30 November 2023. With effect from 
1 December 2023, Palmer Brown will assume the role of Group Chief 
Operating Officer (COO), North America and Petros Parras will be 
appointed as Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

In setting the remuneration packages for the new incumbents, we took 
a measured approach and set pay at a level which is both fair and 
competitive, taking into account the size and scope of the roles, the 
external talent market and the views of our major shareholders.

Base salaries for both Palmer Brown and Petros Parras have been set 
below the levels for the previous incumbent. Palmer Brown has been 
appointed on a base salary of $1,400,000, (c.14% below the salary 
level for the previous incumbent) and Petros Parras has been 
appointed on a base salary of £740,000 (around the lower quartile of 
the FTSE 30 (excluding financial services) and c.10% below the 
previous incumbent). All other elements of their packages, including 
incentive maxima (bonus – 150% of salary, LTIP – 350% of salary) are 
consistent with the 2022 Policy. Pension benefits for both directors 
have been set at 6% of salary which is consistent with the maximum 
rate available to the majority of the wider UK workforce. 

It is recognised that the Group COO, North America role is perhaps 
unique amongst FTSE peers. When considering the salary for this role, 
the Committee was particularly cognisant of the following factors:

 – the size and scale of our North American operations, which 

represent approximately two-thirds of the Group’s operations

 – the ‘hot’ market for talent in our sector, particularly amongst US peers 

against whom we compete for talent. This is a US-based role and 
Palmer, a US citizen, will be returning to the US to undertake the role

 – the skills and experience of Palmer, who joined the business 
22 years ago and who will provide continuity via his extensive 
experience of both functional and operational roles in the Group

The Committee has set remuneration at a level which is below pay 
levels seen in many US organisations. While there is a material 
increase in base salary compared to his previous role, this reflects the 
very significant expansion in the role scope. The Committee will review 
the structure of remuneration in this context during the next 
Remuneration Policy review.

The Committee has deliberately set the base salary for Petros Parras, 
the incoming Group CFO, at a prudent level. In line with best practice, 
the Committee intends to keep his salary under review as he builds 
experience in the role. 

Gary Green will step down from the Board on 30 November 2023 and 
will remain an employee and available to the Group until his retirement 
on 31 March 2024. His departure terms are consistent with the 2022 
Policy. In recognition of his exceptional performance and contribution 
to the organistion, Gary will be treated as a good leaver for incentive 
plan purposes. Outstanding incentives will remain subject to 
performance and will be pro-rated for time. Full details of Gary’s 
remuneration arrangements for his departure are outlined in the 
annual report on remuneration on page 123.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy for the year ahead

The Committee is aware of the ongoing inflationary pressures and the 
impact that this continues to have on our people and their families. 
When deciding the salary increase for the Group CEO, the Committee 
considered the budget for salary increases for the wider workforce. 
Focus has remained on addressing the remuneration of our lowest 
paid employees and we are engaging with several external bodies to 
advocate for progress in this area, including advocacy with clients for 
the payment of a real living wage.

The Committee determined that the base salary level for the Group 
CEO effective 1 January 2024 would be £1,160,000, representing a 
5.9% increase. This is below the average increase for employees 
across the wider UK population which is expected to be around 8% 
during 2024. Although the Committee does not look at benchmarking 
data mechanistically, we are mindful of the positioning of the current 
package for our Group CEO, which is around 20% below the market 
median of our FTSE 30 peers (excluding financial services) 
notwithstanding his experience and track record of success.

The Committee approved the return of a profit growth measure within 
the 2024 annual bonus plan for the Group CEO and Group CFO, 
following the Group’s return to profitable growth. This will replace the 
existing operating margin and revenue growth measures introduced 
during the COVID-19 period. To reflect the progress made in rolling 
out our food waste tracking technology to almost 8,000 sites in 2023, 
the food waste measure will evolve to measuring frequency of usage in 
2024. It is envisaged that this approach will result in better ingredient 
usage, reducing food costs and Scope 3 GHG emissions.

In order to maintain the momentum on margin progression, the 
operating margin measure will remain in the plan for the Group COO, 
North America for this year. The bonus structure for the Group COO, 
North America remains broadly the same as 2023, however with the 
5% Group operating margin element absorbed into the regional 
operating margin element, increasing the weighting on regional 
operating margin to 45%.

The Committee intends to grant LTIP awards at 400% of salary for the 
Group CEO and 350% of salary for other executive directors. During 
our extensive engagement with major shareholders this year, this 
quantum was supported and considered to be appropriate, taking into 
account the record performance achieved this year, the relatively 
modest market positioning of pay in a hot global talent market, and our 
continued commitment to ensuring that stretching targets are set and 
incentive outcomes are supported by the underlying performance of 
the Group.

Looking ahead

I would like to take this opportunity to thank our major shareholders, 
key institutional investor bodies, shareholder proxy agencies and other 
stakeholders for the time taken to engage with us during the year.

We welcome your feedback on all aspects of our approach to executive 
pay and I look forward to speaking with you further in the year ahead, 
as we formally embark on our 2025 Remuneration Policy review.

I hope that you will join the Board in supporting the resolution to

Governance

John Bryant succeeded Carol Arrowsmith as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. Membership of the 
Committee comprises the Chair of the Committee and all the 
independent non-executive directors. Members are appointed by the 
Board following recommendation by the Nomination Committee. 
Biographies of Committee members can be found on pages 59 to 61. 
The Committee meets at least twice a year. The quorum necessary for 
a meeting is two. The Committee held four meetings during the year. 
The meeting attendance table can be found on page 69. The Chair of 
the Committee attends the AGM to respond to any shareholder 
questions that might be raised on the Committee’s activities.

Only members of the Committee have the right to attend its meetings. 
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as Secretary 
to the Committee and attends all its meetings. The Group Chief People 
Officer and the Group Reward Director are invited to attend meetings 
to advise on remuneration matters. The Chair of the Board, Group CEO 
and Group CFO may also attend by invitation. No individual attends 
meetings where their own remuneration is discussed or in 
circumstances where their attendance would not be appropriate. 
Details of the advisers to the Committee can be found on page 126.

The Committee seeks external legal or independent professional 
advice as it sees fit. The terms of reference of the Committee are 
reviewed annually and were last reviewed in September 2023 when 
minor changes were made. The terms of reference can be found on 
our website, www.compass-group.com.

The Committee determines the Company’s Remuneration Policy and 
is responsible for setting remuneration terms and conditions of 
employment for the Chair of the Board, executive directors and the 
Executive Committee. The Committee ensures that members of the 
Executive Committee are appropriately incentivised to drive the 
Group’s performance and are rewarded for their contribution to the 
long-term sustainable success of the business by designing, 
monitoring and assessing incentive arrangements, including setting 
stretching targets and assessing performance and outcomes.

The Committee reviews remuneration arrangements for other senior 
executives within the Group and has regard to the remuneration 
philosophy of the organisation when developing policy and considering 
executives’ packages, monitoring the relationship between executive 
remuneration arrangements and those of the wider workforce. The 
Committee maintains an active dialogue with major shareholders and 
ensures their views and those of the proxy advisers are sought and 
considered when determining Remuneration Policy.

Structure and content of the report

Engagement with shareholders

Development of our current approach to pay

Key factors considered when developing our 
Remuneration Policy:

 – global competitiveness – considering practice when 

compared to companies of a similar financial and operational 
size, global footprint and business complexity, and the ‘hot’ 
market for talent in our sector

 – shareholders’ best interests – it is important for us to retain 

our executives’ skills, capabilities and deep sector 
experience at a key time in our recovery and address the 
significant challenge of rewarding our executives fairly for 
delivering a strong recovery from COVID-19

 – pay for performance – commitment to ensuring incentive 
outcomes are supported by the underlying performance of 
the business

 – market positioning – overall package for the Group CEO 
remains positioned at just below the lower quartile of the 
FTSE 30 (excluding financial services), notwithstanding that 
the current market capitalisation places the Company 
amongst the largest 15 companies in the FTSE 100

 – balanced approach – increases to incentive opportunity 

were introduced in 2022 alongside best practice 
remuneration features (e.g. mandatory bonus deferral and 
increased shareholding guidelines)

The Policy approved by shareholders in 2022 included an increase to 
long-term incentive award levels. While such increases need to be 
approached with caution, the Committee was mindful of the 
commercial challenges and the need to safeguard long-term 
shareholder interests.

In developing the Remuneration Policy, the Committee consulted 
extensively with our largest shareholders prior to the 2022 AGM. The 
feedback received helped the Committee to shape its final proposals.

In advance of the 2022 AGM, the Committee had a clear 
understanding that, while the approach had the support of the 
majority of our investors, there was a minority who were unsupportive 
of the proposed changes at that time and that this would be reflected 
in the voting outcome at the AGM.

After careful consideration of all feedback, the Remuneration 
Committee concluded that the proposed approach was in the 
long-term interests of the Company and of its shareholders. 

The Committee therefore adopted and subsequently implemented the 
Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM.

Since that time, we have maintained dialogue with major shareholders 
on executive pay, particularly with those who did not support the 
Remuneration Policy, with further engagement in the spring of 2022, 
and in early 2023, including a comprehensive engagement exercise in 
advance of the 2023 AGM, when it was apparent that investor 
sentiment remained mixed.

The majority of shareholders, and two of the most prominent voting 
advisory bodies, were supportive of the 2023 DRR. A minority of 
shareholders were influenced by another influential voting advisory 
body that was opposed to the resolution, with concerns primarily 
relating to the Policy approved at the 2022 AGM.

Notably, not all the shareholder dissent was against the increase 
in LTIP quantum; indeed, the largest single vote against the 
Remuneration Policy in 2022, and against the Remuneration 
Report in 2023, was partly influenced by a view that the incentive 
opportunities were not high enough.

Engagement has repeatedly demonstrated that there are mixed 
views across our shareholder base, and the basis for voting differs 
across the register. In this context, building unanimous support has 
remained challenging.

Following the AGM in 2023, we continued our engagement throughout 
the year, writing to our 100 largest shareholders and requesting to 
meet with our largest 30 shareholders, representing almost two-thirds 
of the share register. Meetings took place with five shareholders 
representing 20% of issued share capital, and the three main 
proxy advisers. 

During this engagement exercise, we were pleased to note that 
shareholders are largely supportive of our approach to executive 
remuneration. Shareholders have welcomed the progression of 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets (food safety, 
workplace safety and food waste) within our short-term incentive plan. 
Shareholders were also pleased with the Committee’s decision not 
to exercise positive discretion in respect of the vesting of three 
consecutive LTIP awards, which all lapsed in full over 2020 to 2022 
inclusive, and that they were given the opportunity to contribute to the 
Committee’s deliberations on this matter. We have also received 
feedback on the performance measures within both our short and 
long-term incentive plans and have committed to reviewing these 
during 2024 as part of our 2025 Remuneration Policy review.

Discussions with shareholders have not been limited to executive pay. 
We have listened to shareholder requests to better understand our 
practices more broadly in respect of employees in the Group and have 
held detailed conversations on our approach. This has included the 
pledge of our UK & Ireland business to address and to disclose pay 
gaps, e.g. the UK gender pay gap is below the UK national average 
and the UK ethnicity pay gap is negative, i.e. reflecting a higher 
representation of ethnic minorities working in locations and roles 
which are higher paid. 

We have also discussed our UK business’ accreditation as a Real 
Living Wage Service Provider and, more generally, its advocacy to 
clients and prospective clients for payment of the Real Living Wage. 
We have also discussed how we have been proactive in providing 
additional support to employees, and to those in the communities in 
which we operate. We provide significant support to employees, 
promoting mental health and wellbeing, providing financial education 
and support as well as free food in many locations. We are pleased 
that our approach aligns with best practice shareholder guidelines 
and evolving shareholder views. We also committed to broadening our 
disclosure in these areas in our 2023 Remuneration Report which is 
set out on pages 105 to 106.

As noted in the Committee Chair’s statement, we are committed to a 
constructive dialogue with shareholders and the input provided 
continues to influence the decisions taken by the Committee. We will 
continue to invest time in understanding the differing viewpoints 
before making executive pay decisions.

Remuneration in the wider context

Engaging with our employees

Our people are at the heart of our business and we want our employees to thrive in a fair and inclusive work environment. Understanding their 
needs and motivations helps to provide a great place to work and to drive business performance.

Engagement with our employees takes many forms, including surveys, roundtables, townhall meetings, Speak Up, We’re Listening reports, and 
initiatives in conjunction with trade unions and other employee consultative bodies. Our Designated Non-Executive Director for Workforce 
Engagement, Ireena Vittal, also holds regular roundtable discussions with employees from around the Group, gathering colleagues’ views and 
sharing feedback with the Board. 

Pages 74 to 79 provide an overview of how we engaged with employees and other stakeholders in 2023.

Details of the roundtable sessions are set out on page 75. 

Our employee dashboard

When considering executive remuneration and setting the Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into consideration the wider workforce. A 
detailed employee landscape dashboard was presented to the Committee at its May 2023 meeting. The dashboard covered the following areas:

Employee landscape dashboard

Inflationary 
pressures

Throughout the year, we continued to monitor the inflationary pressures faced by many employees in the Group and made 
tactical changes where appropriate to help mitigate the impact. For example:

 – Our UK&I business:

 – is a Living Wage recognised service provider
 – brought forward the implementation of 2023 salary increases to November 2022 (from January and April 2023)
 – provided around 200,000 free meals for colleagues each week
 – provided enhanced access to loans for individuals who wouldn’t ordinarily be eligible, and access to early pay-days
 – provided access to a Helping Hands fund to support with emergency and unexpected payments
 – introduced financial education seminars covering money management, Compass benefits, savings and investments 

and retirement planning

 – in markets with high inflation such as Türkiye, in keeping with local market practice, our local businesses operated 

additional salary reviews during the year to try to mitigate the impact of inflation

 – for colleagues in North America, 50% of earned wages can be accessed in advance of pay-day, helping them to manage 

their finances more effectively

Minimum 
and Living 
Wage

Compass Group UK&I is a Living Wage Recognised Service Provider, meaning all directly-employed staff are paid at least 
the Real Living Wage. They also offer a Living Wage option in every client bid that is made. The UK&I business has made 
real progress tackling low pay across the UK, with an extra 20,000 colleagues being paid the Real Living Wage or above 
since October 2021. During the year, Compass Group UK&I won the prestigious Living Wage Champion Award in the 
Recognised Service Provider Category at the Living Wage Foundation annual awards.

Gender and 
ethnicity 
pay gap

The Compass UK gender pay gap in 2022 reduced by a quarter from 16.6% to 12.6%, which is below the national average 
of 14.9%. In addition, the median bonus gap reduced from 29.4% to 7.1%. When addressing the gender pay gap, the UK&I 
business has two clear areas of focus: (i) to continue increasing female representation in leadership; and (ii) to increase pay 
for its lowest paid, including the part-time front line workforce which is predominantly made up of women.

The Compass UK ethnicity pay gap was published for the first time in 2022, and our UK&I business started with a median 
ethnic minority pay gap of -7.9% reflecting a higher representation of ethnic minorities working in locations and roles which 
are higher paid. However, there is more work to do to increase representation of ethnic minorities at senior leadership and 
management levels, including targets to promote social and economic mobility.

The Committee reviews the CEO pay ratio and the reasons for any movement in the ratio each year. Further detail can be 
found on page 124.

This year the Committee has overseen an increase in the number of participants in our Long-term Incentive Plan and an 
increase in the maximum value of awards, in order to improve alignment with market practice.

We have a consistent annual bonus plan across our leadership team, with outcomes in the 2023 financial year based on 
local, regional and Group performance.

Remuneration in the wider context continued

Compass North America: 
Health Is Wealth series

Health Is Wealth is a year-long series by Compass Group North 
America’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion team, which promotes the 
health and wellbeing of associates. Every week, the team sent 
eblasts – emailed insights pieces – across Compass Group North 
America. The themes included mental health, physical health, 
financial health and nutritional health.

EAP: Life outside work is important, so we want to make sure it’s 
meaningful and rewarding. In the US, the Employee Assistance 
Program (EAP) provides support to guide employees through personal 
challenges, such as life transitions and family, financial and legal problems. 
It also offers support and strategies to help people manage stress and 
anxiety, and to find suitable childcare, eldercare, special needs 
services, and more.

Associate testimonial: “They really made me feel special and needed. 
Most people don’t ask for help, but the EAP advocates followed-up with 
me and made me feel special. We need more support like this in this 
world. Thank you.”

Even Same Day Pay: Our US business aims to offer total rewards that 
meet real needs. In the US, one of its financial wellbeing programmes 
enables employees to access earned wages in advance of pay-day, 
which can help them manage their finances more effectively.

As of May 2023, employees have accessed more than $58 million 
in wages in advance of pay-day and established savings of over 
$3.8 million. Associates paid hourly are also taking full advantage 
of both the pay advance and savings features of the programme. 
Through signup information, we can see that the number of 
participants in the programme has doubled year on year.  
For those employees participating, turnover is running on 
average 10% lower compared to non-participants, indicating 
that it is a valued programme. 

Alignment of executive and workforce remuneration

Component

Executive directors

Below Board level

Base pay

Salary increases as a percentage of salary are normally 
aligned with, or lower than, the average percentage 
increase for the wider UK population.

For 2024, the Group CEO will receive a salary increase 
of 5.9%.

Benefits

Benefits are aligned to market practice.

Pension

Pension allowance of 6% of base salary, which is aligned 
with the maximum rate available to the majority of the 
wider UK workforce.

The average salary increase for employees across the wider 
UK population is expected to be around 8% during 2024.

Core employee benefits are competitive and reflect local 
market practice.

Pension arrangements reflect local market practices and 
requirements.

The maximum rate available to the majority of the wider UK 
workforce is currently 6% of salary. 

Annual bonus

Maximum annual bonus opportunity of 200% of base salary 
for the Group CEO and 150% of base salary for other 
executive directors.

Annual bonus opportunities vary by role. For the Global 
Leadership team, the principles of the annual bonus plans 
are consistent with those for executive directors.

Annual bonus is subject to performance against financial 
and ESG-related performance measures.

One-third of any bonus earned by executive directors is 
deferred into shares for three years.

They include financial performance targets based on the 
agreed budget, where target bonus is normally calibrated 
for the delivery of budget.

Alternative annual bonus structures may be used below the 
Global Leadership team to meet local requirements and 
regulations, such as profit-sharing or role-focused 
arrangements (e.g. sales or procurement targets).

Long-term 
incentives

Maximum Long-term Incentive Plan opportunity of 400% of 
base salary for the Group CEO and 350% of base salary for 
other executive directors.

The Long-term Incentive Plan is in place across the 
Executive Committee and the Global Leadership team. 
Eligibility is determined by role and individual contribution.

Long-term Incentive Plan awards are subject to 
performance against financial targets measured over a 
three-year period, followed by a two-year holding period. 

The executive directors are required to hold the lower of (i) 
their shareholding at the date of termination of 
employment; or (ii) shares equivalent to their share 
ownership guideline at that date, for a period of two years 
post-employment. 

Long-term incentive awards were made to almost 400 of 
our senior leaders in 2023.

We also operate a Restricted Share Plan below executive 
director level, which supports recruitment and retention.

Awards are typically made four times a year in March, June, 
September and December.

Remuneration Policy

This section of the Report sets out the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy with some minor amendments made to update references, 
where appropriate. We consulted with shareholders extensively 
during 2021 when the 2022 Policy was being formulated, and further 
engaged with shareholders following the 2022 and 2023 AGMs. 
The Policy applied with effect from 3 February 2022 when it was 
approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM and is intended 
to apply until 2025.

The 2022 Policy has been designed to incentivise executives to 
deliver the Company’s strategic objectives. A significant portion of 
remuneration is performance-related, based on a selection of targets 
linked to key business drivers which can be measured and understood 
by both executives and shareholders.

The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy (for 
example for tax, exchange control, regulatory or administrative 
purposes) without obtaining shareholder approval.

The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments, and payments for loss of office (including using any 
discretion available to it in connection with such payments), 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out below 
where the terms of the payment were agreed: (i) before 3 February 
2022 when the 2022 Policy (approved by shareholders in accordance 
with section 439A of the Companies Act) came into effect, provided 
that the terms of the payment were consistent with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (approved by shareholders in accordance with 
section 439A of the Companies Act) in force at the time they were 
agreed; or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director 
of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration of the individual becoming a director of the 
Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award 
over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the 
award is granted.

The Committee considers the general pay and employment conditions 
of all employees within the Group and is sensitive to these, to 
prevailing market and economic conditions and to governance trends 
when assessing the level of salaries and remuneration packages of 
executive directors and other members of the Executive Committee. 
Executive directors have a greater proportion of their total 
remuneration package at risk than other employees; however, the 
structure and principles of incentives are broadly consistent. The 
wider employee population of the Group will receive remuneration that 
is considered to be appropriate in relation to their geographic location, 
level of responsibility and performance.

The Company is committed to ongoing engagement and seeks major 
shareholder views in advance of proposing significant changes to its 
remuneration policies.

Remuneration Policy and practices in the context of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the Code)

The Committee has considered the Remuneration Policy and 
practices in the context of the principles of the Code, as follows:

Clarity – the Committee endorses a transparent approach to 
pay, by engaging regularly with executives, shareholders 
and their representative bodies to explain the approach to 
executive pay and how it links to the Compass strategy. We are 
also committed to clear and transparent disclosure on all 
aspects of executive remuneration.

Simplicity – the purpose, structure and strategic alignment of 
each element of pay has been clearly laid out in the 
Remuneration Policy. The incentive arrangements are well 
understood by both participants and shareholders. The 
Committee monitors the structure of both the annual bonus 
and long-term incentive plans to ensure they are easy to 
understand and avoid unnecessary complexity. Additionally, 
the Committee ensures there is sufficient flexibility to exercise 
discretion and override formulaic outcomes where necessary.

Risk – the Committee ensures a careful balance between 
competitive pay and performance-driven incentives, to mitigate 
any risk of excessive rewards or encouraging the wrong type of 
behaviours. There is an appropriate blend of fixed and variable 
pay elements, which, alongside the Committee’s ability to 
exercise overarching discretion on Compass’ performance 
within the year, allow for a holistic assessment of performance 
in the year. Additionally, there are robust measures in place to 
ensure alignment with long-term shareholder interests, 
including the post-vesting holding period, shareholding 
requirement, malus and clawback provisions and mandatory 
deferral of a proportion of bonus into shares.

Predictability – our Directors’ Remuneration Policy contains 
both target and maximum opportunity details for our incentives, 
with actual performance outcomes dependent upon 
performance achieved against the targets for the period. 
Additionally, potential remuneration opportunities under 
different performance scenarios are set out on page 112 of 
this Report.

Proportionality – executives are incentivised to achieve 
stretching, business-linked targets over annual and three-year 
performance periods, ensuring strong alignment with the 
business’ objectives and creation of long-term sustainable 
value for shareholders. The Committee assesses performance 
holistically at the end of each period, taking into account 
underlying business performance as well as the internal and 
external market context. The Committee may exercise 
discretion to ensure that payouts appropriately reflect the 
experience of the Group during the year.

Alignment with culture – to ensure alignment across the 
organisation, executive director pension cash allowances are 
aligned to the maximum rate available to the majority of the 
wider UK workforce. Additionally, the health and safety of our 
employees, clients and consumers has always been a top 
priority for Compass. We have progressively increased the 
weighting of our ESG measures within the bonus plan, from 
5% to 15%. Our measures are meaningful to our business, 
reflecting the importance of health and safety, and the impact 
of reducing food waste on the environment.

Remuneration Policy continued

Component parts of the remuneration package

The key components of executive directors’ remuneration for the 2022 Policy period are summarised below:

Component and link to strategy

Operation of component

Maximum opportunity

Performance measures

Base salary

Reflects the individual’s role, 
experience and contribution.

Set at levels to attract and 
retain individuals of the 
calibre required to lead 
the business.

Base salaries are reviewed annually 
with any increases normally taking 
effect on 1 January of each year. 
Salaries are appropriately 
benchmarked and reflect the role, 
job size and responsibility as well as 
the performance and effectiveness 
of the individual.

Benefits and pension

To provide a competitive level 
of benefits.

Benefits include but are not limited 
to: healthcare for executive 
directors and their dependants, 
limited financial advice, life 
assurance and car benefit.

These are offered to executive 
directors as part of a competitive 
remuneration package.

The Committee has the discretion 
to offer additional allowances or 
benefits to executive directors, 
if considered appropriate and 
reasonable to the circumstances. 
These may include but are not 
limited to relocation expenses, 
housing allowance and school 
fees where appropriate.

Executive directors are invited to 
participate in the Company’s 
defined contribution pension 
scheme (or local plan) or to take a 
cash allowance in lieu of pension 
entitlement.

None.

Whilst there is no prescribed 
formulaic maximum, any increases 
will take into account prevailing 
market and economic conditions 
as well as increases for the wider 
workforce. Increases may be above 
this when an executive director: 
progresses in the role; gains 
substantially in experience; 
experiences a significant increase 
in the scale of the role; or was 
appointed on a salary below the 
market median. These will be 
appropriately explained in the 
relevant year’s Annual Report.

The cost of providing these benefits 
can vary in accordance with market 
conditions, which will, therefore, 
determine the maximum value.

None.

For the Company’s pension cash 
allowance (or pension contribution 
as appropriate), from 4 February 
2021 the annual maximum was 
aligned to the maximum rate 
available to the majority of the 
wider UK workforce (currently 6% 
of base salary).

In line with the Policy, pension 
contributions for incumbent 
executive directors were aligned 
to this rate over time, with Dominic 
Blakemore and Gary Green’s 
pension allowance reducing to 6% 
on 31 December 2022.

Palmer Brown is eligible to 
participate in the local US 
arrangements, with Company 
contributions capped at 6% 
of salary.

Annual bonus

Incentivises and rewards the 
achievement of stretching 
one-year key performance 
targets set by the Committee at 
the start of each financial year.

Maximum bonus opportunity 
expressed as a percentage of 
base salary:

 – Group CEO: 200%
 – other executive directors: 150%

No bonus is payable for 
performance below threshold level.

The annual bonus is earned by the 
achievement of performance over 
the financial year against targets set 
by the Committee at the start of 
each financial year. It is delivered in 
cash or a combination of cash and 
deferred bonus shares.

The Committee retains discretion to 
adjust the bonus outcomes to 
ensure that they reflect underlying 
business performance.

The annual bonus is subject to 
malus and/or clawback for a period 
of three years following the date of 
payment or grant of an award in the 
event of discovery of: a material 
misstatement in the accounts or 
in the assessment of a relevant 
performance condition; where the 
action or conduct of a participant 
amounts to fraud or serious 
misconduct or has a detrimental 
impact on the reputation of the 
Group; a material corporate failure; 
or the occurrence of any other 
exceptional event as determined at 
the discretion of the Committee.

One-third of the bonus for executive 
directors will be subject to 
mandatory deferral into shares, for 
a period of three years.

Dividend equivalents may be 
accrued on deferred bonus shares.

Performance is measured over 
the financial year. Performance 
measures are determined by the 
Committee each year and may 
vary to ensure that they promote 
the Company’s business 
strategy and shareholder value.

The performance measures and 
their percentage weightings may 
vary, depending upon a 
director’s area of responsibility.

Performance measures may 
include, but are not limited to, 
profit, revenue, margin and cash 
flow. Strategic KPIs including 
ESG measures may also be 
chosen. However, the overall 
metrics will normally be 
weighted to financial measures.

Annual bonus targets are set 
with reference to internal 
budgets and analyst consensus 
forecasts, with maximum payout 
requiring performance well 
ahead of budget.

A bonus underpin may be 
operated so that the bonus 
outcome is reduced if the 
underpin performance is 
not met.

Details of the specific measures 
and targets applying to each 
element of the bonus for 
2023-2024 are shown in the 
Annual Remuneration Report on 
page 120.

Maximum opportunity

Performance measures

Awards may be made at the 
following levels of salary:

Performance is measured over 
three financial years.

 – Group CEO: 400%
 – other executive directors: 350%

For performance measures other 
than TSR, 0% of the award vests  
for below threshold performance, 
increasing to 50% vesting on a 
straight-line basis for achievement of 
on-target performance, increasing to 
maximum vesting for achievement 
of maximum performance.

The element of an award based on 
relative TSR will vest in full for 
top-quartile performance and 25% 
of that element of the award will 
vest if performance is at the 
median. Awards will vest on a 
straight-line basis between median 
and top-quartile performance 
achievement. No shares will 
be released for this element of  
an award if the Company’s 
TSR performance is below 
the median.

Performance measures for the 
2023-2024 award are ROCE, 
AFCF and relative TSR, 
applying 40%, 40% and 
20% respectively.

LTIP targets are set with 
reference to a range of 
relevant reference points 
which may include internal 
budgets and analysts’ 
consensus forecasts, with 
maximum payment requiring 
performance well ahead 
of budget.

Details of the targets for the 
LTIP award to be made in 
2023-2024 are set out as 
required in the Annual 
Remuneration Report on 
page 121.

The Committee has discretion 
to use different or additional 
performance measures or 
weightings for awards in future 
years to ensure that the LTIP 
remains appropriately aligned 
to the prevailing business 
strategy and objectives. The 
Committee would consult with 
major shareholders prior to 
making material changes to 
performance measures.

Long-term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP)

Incentivises and rewards 
executive directors for the 
delivery of longer-term 
financial performance and 
shareholder value.

Share-based to provide 
alignment with shareholder 
interests.

Return on capital 
employed (ROCE)

ROCE supports the strategic 
focus on growth and margin 
through ensuring that cash is 
reinvested to generate strong 
returns with capital discipline.

Adjusted free cash flow 
(AFCF)

The generation of cash is 
fundamental to the ongoing 
success of the Group and the 
use of AFCF as an LTIP 
performance measure 
directly aligns to this.

Relative total 
shareholder return (TSR)

TSR provides direct alignment 
between the interests of 
executive directors and 
shareholders.

An annual conditional award of 
ordinary shares which may be earned 
after a three-year performance 
period, based on the achievement of 
stretching performance conditions. 
Executive directors normally hold 
vested LTIP shares (net of any shares 
sold to meet tax and social security 
liabilities) for a period of two years 
post-vesting.

Calculations of the achievement of 
the targets are independently 
assessed and are approved by the 
Committee. The Committee will 
consider the Group’s underlying 
performance over the performance 
period and has discretion to adjust 
the final vesting level to take this 
into account.

Dividend equivalents may be accrued 
on the shares earned from LTIP awards.

Malus and clawback rules operate in 
respect of the LTIP. The Committee 
may decide at any time before an 
award vests, or for a period of three 
years after an award vests, that any 
participant will be subject to malus 
and/or clawback in the event of: 
discovery of a material misstatement 
in the accounts or in the assessment 
of a relevant performance condition; 
the action or conduct of a participant 
amounting to fraud or serious 
misconduct or having a detrimental 
impact on the reputation of the 
Group; a material corporate failure; 
or any other exceptional event as 
determined at the discretion of 
the Committee.

Awards are delivered in shares. 
However, the rules contain provisions 
to deliver value in cash if necessary 
(for example, due to securities laws), 
subject to the discretion of the 
Committee, determined at any time 
up to the awards’ release.

In the event of a change of control, 
any unvested awards will vest 
immediately, subject to satisfaction of 
performance conditions and reduction 
on a time-apportioned basis.

Incentive plans

Share ownership guidelines

Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

  111

The LTIP described in the table on page 110 (known as The Compass 
Group PLC Long-term Incentive Plan 2018) is the primary form of 
equity incentive for executive directors.

Dilution limits

All of the Company’s equity-based incentive plans incorporate 
the current Investment Association’s Principles of Remuneration (the 
Principles) on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all 
plans should not exceed 10% over a 10-year period in relation to the 
Company’s issued share capital (or reissue of treasury shares), with a 
further limitation of 5% in any 10-year period for executive plans.

The Committee monitors the position regularly and prior to making 
an award ensures that the Company remains within these limits. 
Any awards which are required to be satisfied by market-purchased 
shares are excluded from such calculations. On 30 September 2023, 
the Company held 70,170,859 treasury shares. During the 2023 
financial year, 800,000 shares were purchased in the market by the 
trustees of The Compass Group PLC All Share Schemes Trust. 
1,343,592 treasury shares and 448,686 market-purchased shares 
were used in the year to satisfy the Company’s obligations under the 
Group’s employee equity incentive schemes.

As at 30 September 2023, the Company’s headroom position, 
which remains within the current Principles, was as shown in 
the charts below:

In order that their interests are linked with those of shareholders, 
directors are expected to build up and maintain a personal 
shareholding in the Company. Under the 2022 Policy the Group 
CEO and all other executive directors are required to build up and 
maintain a personal shareholding of 400% and 350% of base 
salary, respectively.

The shareholding guideline may be achieved by executive directors 
retaining shares received as a result of participating in the Company’s 
share plans. The guidelines specifically exclude the need to make a 
personal investment should awards not vest. The required level of 
executive shareholding is expected to be achieved within a five-year 
period commencing from the date of appointment or date of 
increase in shareholding requirement, whichever is the later.

Directors’ shareholdings are reviewed annually by the Committee 
to ensure that directors are on course to achieve their guideline 
shareholding within the period required. However, if it becomes 
apparent to the Committee that the guidelines are unlikely to be met 
within the timeframe, then the Committee will discuss with the 
director a plan to ensure that they are met over an acceptable 
timeframe. The Committee reserves the right to make the granting of 
future LTIP awards to an executive director conditional upon reaching 
the appropriate threshold in the required timeframe. For annual bonus 
awards for executive directors for periods commencing on or after 
1 October 2022, a minimum of one-third of the annual bonus earned 
will be deferred into shares for three years.

A post-employment shareholding requirement was implemented 
under the Share Ownership Guideline Policy for executive directors 
and applies to awards acquired after the effective date of the 2021 
Policy (4 February 2021). The Policy requires executive directors to 
hold the lower of (i) their shareholding at the date of termination of 
employment; or (ii) shares equivalent to their share ownership 
guideline at that date, for a period of two years post employment.

Non-executive directors are required to build up and retain a personal 
shareholding equal to the value of their base fee over four years. 
Non-executive directors are generally expected to purchase shares 
equating to a minimum value of one-third of their net-of-tax fee each 
year until the guideline is met.

Details of the interests of directors in shares and equity incentives are 
set out on page 123, together with the extent to which each of the 
directors has complied with the share ownership guidelines as at 
30 September 2023.

Approach to recruitment remuneration

The Committee will apply the 2022 Policy when considering 
the recruitment of a new executive director in respect of base salary, 
pension and benefits, and short and long-term incentives. Executive 
directors will be provided with a pension cash allowance (or 
contribution) in line with the maximum level of pension provided to the 
majority of the wider UK workforce (currently 6% of base salary). It is 
envisaged that the maximum level of variable remuneration which 
may be granted to a new executive director would be within plan rules 
and consistent with the 2022 Policy maximum opportunity for existing 
executive directors and the Group CEO.

Other arrangements may be established specifically to 
facilitate recruitment of a particular individual, albeit that any such 
arrangement would be made within the context of aiming to minimise 
the cost to the Company. The policy for the recruitment of executive 
directors includes the facility to provide a level of compensation for 
forfeited remuneration arrangements from an existing employer if 
these are required in order to achieve a successful recruitment. Any 
arrangement established specifically to facilitate the recruitment of a 
particular individual would be intended to be of comparable form, 
timing and commercial value to the benefits forfeited, and capped as 
appropriate. The quantum, form and structure of any buyout 
arrangement will be determined by the Committee taking into account 
the terms of the previous arrangement being forfeited. The buyout 
may be structured as an award of cash or shares. However, the 
Committee will normally have a preference for replacement awards to 
be made in the form of shares, deliverable no earlier than the original 
awards. Where an executive director is appointed from either within 
the Group or following corporate activity/reorganisation, the normal 
policy would be to honour any legacy incentive arrangements to run 
off in line with their original terms and conditions.

 
 
 
Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

The historic policy on the payment of bonus on termination, which was 
in place prior to June 2008, was the provision of a payment, at par or 
target, of bonus in respect of the notice period, where the Company 
exercised its right to make a payment in lieu of notice. Gary Green’s 
service contract is based on this historic policy. When introducing the 
revised policy in June 2008 and after careful consideration, the 
Committee concluded that it was not in shareholders’ interests to 
migrate such contracts onto the amended policy. Service contracts 
for Dominic Blakemore, Palmer Brown and Petros Parras fully comply 
with the policy in effect from June 2008. All executive directors’ 
service contracts impose a clear obligation to mitigate such payment 
should a departing executive director take on new employment or 
receive alternative remuneration.

Gary Green’s service contract was entered into before 27 June 2012, 
and it has not been renewed on or after that date. Consequently, 
remuneration payments or payments for loss of office that are 
required to be made under Gary Green’s contract are not 
required to be consistent with the current Policy.

The Company may also pay for reasonable costs in relation 
to termination of employment, for example tax, legal and 
outplacement support, where appropriate.

Whilst unvested share awards will normally lapse, the Committee may 
in its absolute discretion allow for awards to continue until the normal 
vesting date, or for vesting to be accelerated (for example on death), 
subject to achievement of the attendant performance conditions. 
In such circumstances, awards vesting will normally be prorated on a 
time-apportioned basis, unless the Committee determines otherwise. 
Any such discretion in respect of leavers would only be applied by the 
Committee to ‘good leavers’ where it considers that continued 
participation is justified, for example by reference to performance 
prior to the date of leaving. The malus and clawback provisions would 
continue to apply in the event that any such discretion was exercised.

on the Board for the periods shown below and have service 
agreements dated as follows:

In cases where an executive director must be relocated from their 
home location as part of their appointment, additional benefits in 
kind and other allowances may be payable at the Committee’s 
discretion, including but not limited to relocation, education, 
repatriation costs, tax equalisation or other reasonable international 
assignment support normally consistent with the relevant policies 
applicable to the wider workforce.

It is the Board’s intention that the policy on the recruitment of 
new non-executive directors during the 2022 Policy period will apply 
remuneration elements consistent with those in place for the existing 
non-executive directors. It is not intended that cash supplements, 
day rates or benefits in kind be offered, although in exceptional 
circumstances such remuneration may be required in currently 
unforeseen circumstances. Non-executive directors are not eligible 
for pension scheme membership, bonus or incentive arrangements.

The fee for the Chair of the Board (Chair) is reviewed annually by the 
Committee with any increase normally taking effect on 1 October. 
The Chair is not eligible for pension scheme membership, bonus or 
incentive arrangements. Costs in relation to business travel are 
reimbursed. The Chair’s appointment is terminable without

Ian Meakins has a letter of engagement dated 17 August 2020 in 
respect of his original appointment as a non-executive director, for a 
period of three years from 1 September 2020, and his subsequent 
appointment as Chair. Following a recommendation by the 
Nomination Committee, which was approved by the Board, Ian’s 
appointment was renewed on 9 May 2023 for a further period of three 
years. The fee paid to Ian Meakins for 2023 is set out on page 119.

Non-executive directors’ remuneration

The fees for the non-executive directors are reviewed and determined 
by the Board each year to reflect appropriate market conditions and 
may be increased if considered appropriate. All non-executive 
directors receive a base fee. Additional fees are payable for other 
Board duties and time commitments, including acting as Chair of 
the Audit, Remuneration or Corporate Responsibility Committee, 
and undertaking the role of Senior Independent Director (SID). 
An additional fee may be payable for the role of Designated Non-
executive director for workforce engagement. Non-executive directors 
are not eligible for pension scheme membership, bonus, incentive 
arrangements or other benefits, save reimbursement of travel costs 
and associated tax due if applicable. Fees paid in respect of the 2023 
financial year are set out on page 119.

Non-executive directors have letters of engagement setting out their 
duties and the time commitment expected. They are appointed for an 
initial period of three years, after which the appointment is renewable 
at three-year intervals by mutual consent. In accordance with the 
Code, all directors offer themselves for annual re-election by 
shareholders. Details of the appointments of non-executive directors 
(in office at the date of this DRR) which are terminable without

3.  The 2020-2021 LTIP award will vest in November 2023. Details of the performance measures and performance achieved are shown on pages 117 to 118. 
The amount presented includes the value of accrued dividend-equivalent shares. The values attributed to share price growth for Dominic Blakemore and 
Gary Green were £1,331k and £1,236k respectively.

4.  The base salary, taxable benefits and pension figures for Palmer Brown for 2022 are pro-rated for his time in office during the year.
5.  Palmer Brown and Gary Green’s base salary and other emoluments for the year are shown in sterling at an exchange rate of $1.2217/£1 (2022: $1.2785/£1).

Base salary

The Committee reviewed base salaries in the context of the Group’s strong performance in the year, its relative market positioning when measured 
against companies of comparable size, scale and complexity and also took into account the average salary increase in the wider employee 
population. The base salary increase percentage for each executive director was lower than the average percentage increase for the wider 
UK population.

The annual base salary for each executive director for the year ended 30 September 2023 is set out below:

At 30 September 2023, there were no executive directors actively participating in any Compass Group defined benefit pension arrangements and 
none of the executive directors were accruing additional entitlements to benefits under any arrangements that existed prior to their appointment 
as executive directors.

Under the 2022 Policy, the allowance receivable by the executive directors was reduced on a phased basis and by 31 December 2022 aligned 
with the maximum rate available to the majority of the wider UK workforce, which is currently 6%. When Palmer Brown was appointed as Group 
CFO, he was appointed with a pension cash allowance of 6% of base salary. The pension cash allowance for Dominic Blakemore and Gary Green 
reduced as set out below, with the 31 December 2022 change representing the final reduction:

Annual bonus plans

2022-2023 bonus

The bonus targets and outcomes for the year ended 30 September 2023 are set out below. The achievement of targets is calculated on a 
straight-line basis between Minimum and Target (par) and between Target and Maximum, and by reference to budgeted exchange rates.

As was the case in previous years, the measurement of the achievement of the financial results is based on the underlying outcome achieved in 
the financial year, with gains/losses attributable to currency movements, charges and the impacts of restructuring and/or acquisitions/disposals 
usually being excluded.

Structure

The bonus plan for 2022-2023 was designed to align the plan to the Group’s strategy for growth and to establish targets that were achievable, fair 
and within management’s control.

The bonus structure for 2022-2023 is set out below:

This is an important measure of the efficiency of the Group’s operations in 
delivering great food and support services to our clients and consumers.
This demonstrates the Group’s ability to convert profit into cash. Regardless of 
absolute profit, it aims to ensure a certain conversion rate is achieved and 
incorporates key levers under management control.
This embodies the Group’s success in growing and retaining the Group’s 
customer base, as well as its ability to drive volumes in its existing business and 
maintain appropriate pricing levels that take into account input cost inflation.
A reduction in lost time incidents is an important measure of the effectiveness of 
the Group’s safety culture. It also lowers rates of absenteeism and costs 
associated with work-related injuries and illnesses.
Food safety is a measure of the Group’s ability to provide food that is safe and of 
the right quality to its consumers globally.
Food waste is a key contributor to carbon emissions. Reducing this also has a 
high correlation with operating margin improvement. Raising awareness through 
measurement will help to drive a significant reduction in food waste.

2.  Operating margin is underlying operating profit divided by underlying revenue.
3.  Organic revenue growth is underlying revenue excluding businesses acquired, sold and closed in the year.
4.  Cash conversion is underlying operating cash flow divided by underlying operating profit expressed as a percentage.
5.  One-third of the value of the bonus for each executive director will be deferred into shares. 

Long-term Incentive Plan awards

Scheme interests vesting during the year

2020-2021 LTIP award
Awards were made to Dominic Blakemore and Gary Green in December 2020 which were subject to the achievement of three-year performance 
targets for the year ended 30 September 2023. Performance conditions were ROCE, AFCF and Relative TSR, weighted 40%, 40% and 20% 
respectively. The definitions are set out in the table below:

Measure

Definition of measure

ROCE

AFCF

TSR

The definition aims to measure the underlying economic performance of the Group. ROCE is calculated at the end of the 
three-year performance period as net underlying operating profit after tax (NOPAT) divided by 12-month average capital 
employed. ROCE targets are updated at the end of the performance period to reflect actual acquisition spend, changes in 
accounting standards and constant currency.

The definition aims to measure the cash generation of the Group and is calculated as the three-year cumulative underlying free 
cash flow adjusted for constant currency.

Performance is compared to that of constituent members of the FTSE 100 (excluding the financial services sector). TSR is the 
aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid (assuming reinvestment of those dividends in the Company’s shares during 
the three-year performance period).

Shareholder experience over the three-year performance period has been extremely positive. The share price at the time of grant in December 
2020 was £13.78. The average share price over the last three months of the performance period, upon which the TSR calculations are based, was 
£20.36. Compass ended the performance period ranked 10th of the 73 companies that remain within the comparator group. As this position is 
within the upper quartile of the comparator group, the proportion of shares subject to the TSR performance condition will vest in full.

AFCF for the period was £2,890m and the business delivered ROCE of 17.44%. Our adjusted free cash flow performance over the three-year 
period exceeded our target ranges and has far exceeded any reasonable forecast when the targets were originally set. As a result of our strong 
performance over the three-year performance period, the 2020-2021 LTIP award will vest in full.

Prior to grant, the Committee scaled back the award levels by 30% of salary for Dominic Blakemore and 25% of salary for Gary Green and the 
former Group CFO, Karen Witts, to take into account the fall in the share price as a consequence of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
on the business.

In undertaking the review of outcomes of the incentive awards to ensure they are supported by the underlying performance of the Company, 
the Committee noted that both the annual incentive outcome and the vesting level of the LTIP reflected the Group’s strong recovery from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, with revenue surpassing its pre-COVID level this year, underlying operating profit exceeding £2 billion and the share price 
reaching an all-time high of £22.50 during 2023. The Committee decided not to exercise any positive discretion in respect of the previous three 
long-term incentive outcomes, although it was arguable that during the latter two years, the success of the business recovery and the growth 
trajectory could have justified a modest level of vesting.

 
118  Governance

Remuneration report continued

Historically, the Committee has taken a disciplined approach and continues to take a robust view in respect of the awards vesting in 2023. In 
addition to the formulaic outcome, the Committee considered the level of vesting on both an absolute and relative basis, including conducting a 
detailed review of performance against its principal competitors at multiple points within the performance period. The Committee has reviewed 
the performance through a number of different lenses and on that basis, following a thorough evaluation, the Committee is satisfied that the 
performance levels achieved justify the vesting level.

2.  The Committee applied the established framework to deal with items that were unforeseen at the time the targets were set in May 2021 and which were in the 

long-term interests of shareholders. AFCF was adjusted to exclude the impact of a significant contract renegotiation in the North America business. This adjustment 
did not have any impact on the level of vesting under the award.

3.  TSR ranking was 10th out of the 73 constituents in the comparator group, resulting in upper quartile performance.

value of shares on vesting. 

2. Palmer Brown received an award of 57,136 shares in respect of the 2020-2021 LTIP prior to his appointment as an executive director. The award was subject to the 
same performance conditions as detailed above, and the award, including 1,860 dividend equivalent shares will vest in full. The estimated value of the award is £1,201k.

Scheme interests awarded during the year

2022-2023 LTIP award

On 1 December 2022, executive directors received a conditional award of shares which may vest after a three-year performance period which will 
end on 30 September 2025, based on the achievement of stretching performance conditions. Performance conditions were ROCE, AFCF and 
Relative TSR, weighted 40%, 40% and 20% respectively. Definitions of each of these measures are set out in the table on page 117.

3.  Face value of award was converted to sterling at the time of award at an exchange rate of $1.1997/£1.

Executive directors are required to hold vested awards for a period of two years following vesting to strengthen the long-term alignment of 
executives’ remuneration packages with shareholders’ interests and, if required, to facilitate the implementation of provisions related to 
clawback. For awards granted after 4 February 2021 a two-year post-employment shareholding requirement also applies.

In setting the performance targets, the Committee considers internal budgets and the Group’s strategic plan, market expectations and general 
economic conditions. The targets under the 2022-2023 award are set out in the table below:

Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for the 2024 financial year

A summary of how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be applied during the 2024 financial year is set out below.

Base salary

The Committee considered the salary review of the Group CEO holistically, taking into account the macroeconomic environment, cost of living and 
inflationary challenges faced by the business and our employees. The Committee also reviewed the base salary in the context of the Group’s 
strong performance in the year, along with our relative market positioning when measured against companies of appropriate size, scale and 
complexity. Salary increase budgets for the wider employee population were taken into consideration and the Committee determined that the 
percentage increase for the Group CEO would be lower than the average percentage increase for the wider UK population which is expected to be 
around 8% during 2024. Further information on the Committee’s considerations when setting the remuneration arrangements for base salary is 
set out in the Chair of the Committee’s letter on page 99.

The base salaries for the executive directors as determined by the Committee are set out in the table below:

1.  Petros Parras will be appointed to the Board effective 1 December 2023.

To reflect the Group’s return to profitable growth, the 2024 annual bonus plan will consist of a profit growth measure for the Group CEO and Group 
CFO. This will replace the existing operating margin and revenue growth measures. To continue the momentum on margin progression, for the 
Group COO, North America, the operating margin measure will remain in the plan for 2024. The 2024 structure for the Group COO, North America 
remains broadly the same as 2023; however, the 5% Group operating margin element will be absorbed into the regional operating margin 
element, increasing the regional operating margin weighting to 45%.

In 2023, we introduced food waste as a new measure in the annual bonus plan, as part of the existing suite of ESG measures. Food is at the core of 
our business and one of the ways we can make a significant impact on climate change is by reducing food waste. The 2023 target was to deploy 
technology across a number of sites to formally measure food waste. To create an accurate baseline for measuring actual food waste and 
translating this into an appropriate target within the bonus plan, the measure will evolve from a technology deployment target in 2023 to 
measuring frequency of usage rates in 2024. It is envisaged that this approach will result in better ingredient usage, reducing food costs and 
Scope 3 GHG emissions. It is our intention to move towards a food waste reduction target in 2025.

We will continue to incentivise improvement in our core health and safety measures within the annual bonus plan. For 2024, it is intended that we 
will move from measuring lost time incidents to total recordable injuries which is considered a more holistic measure that takes into account all 
workplace risks. It is recognised that there may be initial instability during the introductory year and therefore the Committee will monitor performance 
against both measurement criteria and take a holistic view of this component of ESG performance at the end of the performance period.

The measures and weightings will be as follows: 

Group CEO and Group CFO
Measure1

Profit growth (%)

Description of measure

A key measure of our financial performance encompassing revenue and margin 
performance in one metric, by comparing the underlying operating profit delivered in 
the current year with that of the prior year, expressed as a percentage and adjusted 
for exchange rate movements.

Cash conversion (%)

Demonstrates the Group’s ability to convert profit into cash – by setting a target 
percentage of profit to be converted to cash.

ESG2

Total

Emphasises the Group’s commitment to its health and safety culture, and the impact 
of reducing food waste on climate change.

1.  All measures are assessed at Group level.
2.  The ESG measures are Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR), Food Safety Incident Rate (FSIR) and food waste, weighted equally.

Group COO, North America
Measure1

Operating margin (%)

Description of measure

Demonstrates the efficiency of the region’s operations in delivering great food and support 
services.

Cash conversion (%)

Demonstrates the region’s ability to convert profit into cash – by setting a target percentage of 
profit to be converted to cash.

Organic revenue  
growth (%)

Compares the revenue delivered from continuing operations in the current year with that from 
the prior year, adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange rate 
movements.

The Committee has chosen not to disclose the details of the targets in this DRR, as in the opinion of the Committee they are commercially 
sensitive. However, the specific targets and the extent to which the targets have been met (at both Group and regional levels) will be disclosed in 
next year’s DRR.

Long-term Incentive Plan award

The Committee intends to grant LTIP awards to the executive directors during the 2024 financial year, with award levels in line with the 2022 
Policy, as shown in the following table:

% salary

400%

1.  Petros Parras will be appointed to the Board effective 1 December 2023.

The extent to which these LTIP awards will vest will be dependent on performance assessed over the three financial years 2024-2026, using the 
following three performance measures, and with targets as shown in the table below.

Measure

ROCE

AFCF

TSR

Description of measure

The definition aims to measure the underlying economic performance of the Group. ROCE is calculated at the end of the 
three-year performance period as net underlying operating profit after tax (NOPAT) divided by 12-month average capital 
employed. ROCE targets are updated at the end of the performance period to reflect actual acquisition spend, changes in 
accounting standards and constant currency.

The definition aims to measure the cash generation of the Group and is calculated as the three-year cumulative underlying 
free cash flow adjusted for constant currency.

Relative TSR performance is compared to that of constituent members of the FTSE 100 (excluding the financial services 
sector). TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid (assuming reinvestment of those dividends in the 
Company’s shares during the three-year performance period).

There is no vesting for below-threshold performance, and straight-line vesting between the points shown.

In line with the 2022 Policy, executive directors are required to hold vested awards for a period of two years following vesting to strengthen the 
long-term alignment of executives’ remuneration packages with shareholders’ interests; and, if required, to facilitate the implementation 
of provisions related to clawback. For awards granted after 4 February 2021 a two-year post-employment shareholding requirement applies.

Non-executive director fees

The fees for non-executive directors for the coming year are set out below. Following a review of the market, the fee for the Chair was increased 
from £562,500 to £595,900 (5.9%) with effect from 1 October 2023. The base fee for non-executive directors was increased from £94,000 to 
£99,575 (5.9%) also with effect from 1 October 2023. The additional fees for acting as Chair of a committee or as the Senior Independent Director 
remain unchanged.

Share ownership guidelines and directors’ interests in shares

In order that their interests are aligned with those of shareholders, directors are expected to build up and maintain a personal shareholding in the 
Company as set out in the share ownership guidelines described in the 2022 Policy on page 111.

Executive directors are required to achieve their shareholding guideline within a five-year period commencing on the date of appointment or date 
of increase in shareholding requirement, whichever is the later. The guideline for executive directors increased on 3 February 2022. Compliance 
with the guideline is assessed annually, on a pro-rata basis.

Non-executive directors are required to achieve their shareholding guideline within a four-year period from the date of appointment.

 
Compass Group PLC  Annual Report 2023

1.  The share ownership guideline is a percentage of base salary or fee.
2.  Palmer Brown’s conditional LTIP holding includes 20,243 deferred bonus shares, 57,136 LTIP shares and 1,260 SMIPP shares granted prior to his appointment as 
a director. 57,136 LTIP shares and 1,860 dividend equivalent shares will vest in November 2023 and 1,260 SMIPP shares and 40 dividend equivalent shares will 
vest in December 2023. Palmer will retain the net number of vested shares following the sale of sufficient shares to cover the income tax and social security 
obligations due on vesting. In line with the 2022 Policy, one-third of Palmer’s 2023 bonus will be deferred into shares. His current shareholding exceeds his 
shareholding requirement as measured on a pro-rata basis.

3.  In line with the 2022 Policy, Gary Green is required to comply with the Group’s post-employment shareholding requirement for a period of two years post employment.

There were no changes in directors’ interests between 30 September 2023 and 20 November 2023.

Director and role changes during the year

On the recommendation of the Nomination Committee the following changes were made to directors’ roles and responsibilities during the year:

 – Carol Arrowsmith stepped down as Chair of the Remuneration Committee at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM and was succeeded by John Bryant
 – Leanne Wood was appointed to the Board on 4 May 2023 and became a member of the Audit, Corporate Responsibility, Nomination and 

Remuneration Committees on the same day

 – John Bryant stepped down as Senior Independent Director on 20 July 2023 and was succeeded by Anne-Françoise Nesmes. John remains the 

Chair of the Remuneration Committee and a member of the Audit, Corporate Responsibility and Nomination Committees

Retirement of Gary Green, Group COO, North America

Gary Green will retire as a director of Compass Group PLC on 30 November 2023 but remains an employee on his existing terms of employment 
until 31 March 2024 (the Retirement Date) in order to facilitate an orderly handover. Gary is not entitled to any severance payment, notice pay 
or payment for loss of office.

Gary is entitled to an annual bonus for the 2023 financial year. Details of this bonus payment are set out on page 117, with one-third delivered as a 
deferred bonus share award. Gary will participate in the 2023-2024 annual bonus plan for the period from 1 October 2023 to the Retirement 
Date, with his bonus being determined at the normal time and in the normal way, but with the entitlement pro-rated to that date. Details of the 
performance targets and bonus outcome will be set out in the 2024 DRR. In order to comply with certain US tax rules, any bonus payment made 
to Gary following the Retirement Date will be paid entirely in cash without deferral into shares. For the same reason, in accordance with the rules 
of the plan, Gary’s existing deferred share awards will also vest and be settled at the Retirement Date. Gary will continue to be subject to the 
clawback provisions that apply in respect of deferred bonus. 

Gary’s unvested share awards under the LTIP will be preserved in accordance with the good leaver provisions in the plan rules, and will vest at the 
normal time subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions and a time pro-rating adjustment to reflect the proportion of the applicable 
performance period that has passed at the time of the Retirement Date. Information relating to the vesting of shares under the LTIP will be 
included in the relevant DRR. The holding periods that apply to Gary’s vested share awards under the LTIP will continue to apply. Gary is subject 
to a post-employment shareholding requirement which requires him to retain shares that vest under his 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 LTIP awards 
for two years from his Retirement Date and to certain post termination restrictive covenants for a period of 18 months from the Retirement Date.

Payments for loss of office

There were no payments for loss of office during the year.

Payments to past directors

External non-executive director appointments

Executive directors may accept one non-executive directorship in a FTSE 100 company or other significant appointment outside the Company, 
subject to the Board’s approval and provided that such an appointment is not likely to lead to a conflict of interest. It is recognised that non-
executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit the Company. Dominic Blakemore received fees of £128,750 in 
respect of his directorship at London Stock Exchange Group plc for the 2023 financial year. At the date of this DRR, Palmer Brown and Gary Green 
do not hold any paid external appointments.

Group CEO pay ratio

The ratio between the Group CEO’s remuneration and the lower quartile, median and upper quartile of UK employees is disclosed in the table 
below. Figures include the Group CEO’s total remuneration as set out in the single figure table on page 115, and the remuneration paid to 
employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles, over the past four financial years. Methodology A has been chosen to calculate the ratio, as it is 
considered the most accurate approach. This method includes total full-time equivalent remuneration for UK employees received by an individual 
in respect of the relevant financial year and is calculated in line with the methodology for the single figure of remuneration for the Group CEO.

The best equivalents for the three UK employees whose hourly rates of pay were at the 25th, median and 75th percentiles were selected, with a 
small number of employees around each quartile reviewed, to ensure that the employees chosen at the three percentile points were, within 
reason, representative of the pay of the UK workforce at each quartile. The Committee has considered the pay data of the three employees 
identified and believes that it fairly reflects pay at the relevant quartiles amongst the UK workforce. The three individuals identified did not receive 
any remuneration which would otherwise inflate their pay figures.

Executive remuneration, in line with market practice, includes a significant proportion subject to performance and therefore ‘at risk’. As a result, 
remuneration of the Group CEO is weighted more heavily towards variable pay than that of the wider workforce. The ratio will therefore fluctuate 
each year depending on the performance of the Company. During the financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022, remuneration was significantly 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which had a significant impact on variable pay elements.

The financial year 2023 included the first LTIP vesting for executive directors in three years, following the Committee electing not to exercise 
positive discretion despite its strong recovery over the three years. The increase in the Group CEO’s remuneration and associated pay ratio 
reflects the Group’s exceptional performance in 2023, where record levels of performance have been achieved in many areas. The ratio has 
therefore increased, which reflects the correlation between pay and performance. We believe that the median pay ratio is consistent with the pay, 
reward and progression policies for the Company’s UK employees taken as a whole.

1.  The annual percentage change in salary is calculated by reference to actual salary paid and for directors is calculated on a full-time equivalent basis.
2.  The annual percentage change in bonus is calculated by reference to the bonus payable in respect of performance applicable to the financial year for executive 

directors, and by reference to all bonus payments received during the financial year for UK employees.

3.  The annual percentage change in benefits is calculated by reference to the value of benefits received in respect of the financial year. Non-executive directors’ travel 
expenses to/from meetings in the UK are considered a benefit and are disclosed in the DRR. The decrease in benefits value between 2022 and 2023 for the Group 
CEO and UK employees is due to the take-up of electric company vehicles, which have a lower taxable value than a cash for car allowance or a non-electric 
Company vehicle. The increase in benefits value between 2022 and 2023 for the non-executive directors is due to limited travel expenses incurred in the 
2021-2022 UK tax year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the year on which the 2022 figures are based. 
4.  N/A refers to a nil value in the previous year, meaning that a year-on-year change cannot be calculated.
5.  The annual percentage increase/decrease in fees reflects a change in role during the year, as more fully detailed on page 123.
6.  Appointed to the Board on 4 May 2023. Fees for 2023 have been prorated to reflect time in office.
7.  Average employee pay is calculated by reference to the mean average pay of employees within the UK.

1.  The year-on-year percentage change in disbursements reflects the Company’s continued recovery from the impact of COVID-19.
2.  At the AGM on 9 February 2023, shareholders approved Resolution 22 to give the directors authority to make limited on-market purchases of up to 10% of the 
Company’s ordinary shares. 46,311,952 shares were repurchased during the financial year ended 30 September 2023 at a cost of £929 million excluding 
transaction costs. The directors consider it desirable for such general authority to be available to maintain an efficient capital structure whilst at the same time 
retaining the flexibility to fund any bolt-on acquisitions.

3.  The share capital in issue on 30 September 2023 and on the same date in 2022 was 1,785 million ordinary shares of 111⁄20 pence each.
4.  Total employee costs include wages and salaries, social security costs, share-based payments and pension costs for all employees, including directors. The average 

number of employees, including directors and part-time employees in operations, during 2023 was 562,460 (2022: 513,707).

126  Governance

Remuneration report continued

Remuneration of other senior executives and management

A number of senior executives and the executive directors comprise 
the Executive Committee. These key management roles influence the 
ability of the Group to meet its strategic targets. The Remuneration 
Committee sets the remuneration for these individuals and considers 
the remuneration levels and structure of the wider business. 
Total remuneration including base salary and other short-term 
benefits, bonus and the expected value of long-term incentives for 
this group is summarised in note 4 to the consolidated financial 
statements on page 157.

Remuneration advice

The Group Chief People Officer and the Group Reward Director are 
normally invited to attend each Committee meeting to advise on 
remuneration matters. The Chair of the Board, Group CEO and Group 
CFO may also attend from time to time by invitation. They are not paid 
a fee for attending the Committee in addition to their normal 
remuneration from the Company under their service contracts. None 
of the foregoing attend when their own remuneration is discussed. 
Details of the members of the Committee who served during the 2023 
financial year are set out on pages 59 to 61.

The Committee appointed Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) as its independent 
remuneration adviser in September 2021. Deloitte’s fees during 2023 
were £104,400 (2022: £40,750). Fees are charged on a time and 
materials basis and covered advice on executive remuneration, 
attendance at Committee meetings, general advice and updates on 
remuneration developments. Deloitte provided advice to the Group in 
relation to tax and accounting, technology and other consulting 
services during the year. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and complies with its Code of Conduct.

Alithos Limited (Alithos) was appointed by the Company in 2002. 
During the year, Alithos provided information for the testing of the 
TSR performance conditions for the Company’s LTIP awards, for 

which it received fixed fees of £24,000 (2022: £24,000). Alithos also 
provided other share price and TSR data to the Committee during the 
year for which it received fees of £500 (2022: £500). Alithos provided 
additional TSR analysis to the Company during the year for which it 
received a fee of £7,000 (2022: £2,000).

The Committee is satisfied that the advice it received during  
the year was objective and independent, based on the experience 
of its members.

Committee evaluation

The priorities set by the Committee in response to last year’s external 
evaluation process were:

 – determining appropriate performance measures and targets, 

including ESG metrics

 – considering the economic/geopolitical environment when assessing 

performance

These themes, together with the Committee’s regular programme of 
work, shaped the Committee’s agenda and were included in the 
principal activities during the year.

2023 evaluation

During the year, an internal evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
Committee was conducted as part of the wider evaluation of the Board 
and its committees. Details can be found on page 96.

The evaluation concluded that the Committee continued to operate 
effectively and identified a number of priorities for 2024 which 
included focusing on target setting and stretch, ESG measures in 
incentives, and investor engagement.

These matters, together with the regular work of the Committee, will 
inform the Committee’s agenda for the coming year.

shares of 11 1⁄20 pence each. At the date of this Report, 1,785,403,977

treasury shares have been reissued and no shares have been released 
by the ASST since the end of the financial year to the date of this 
Report to satisfy awards under these schemes.

There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
capital of the Company other than those restrictions which may from

the transfer of securities and/or voting rights.

The Company is not aware of any significant agreements to which it is 
party, that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover.

More detailed information relating to the rights and obligations 
attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, and those conferred by 
law, are set out in the Company’s articles of association.

Articles of association

equity incentive schemes. Shares held in treasury are not eligible to 
participate in dividends and do not carry any voting rights. Further 
details of treasury shares and the share buyback programme are set 
out on page 195.

At the 2024 AGM, a special resolution will be proposed to renew the 
directors’ limited authority (last granted at the 2023 AGM) to 
purchase the Company’s ordinary shares in the market.

Issue of shares

At the 2024 AGM, the directors will ask shareholders to renew 
the authority last granted to them at the 2023 AGM to allot equity 
shares representing approximately one-third of the issued ordinary 
shares calculated at the latest practicable date prior to the publication 
of the Notice of AGM (the section 551 authority) and, in accordance 
with the Investment Association Share Capital Management 
Guidelines, the directors propose to extend this by a further one-third 
of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital, provided that such 
amount shall only be used in connection with a rights issue. If 
approved, the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the 
date the resolution is passed, or at the conclusion of the Company’s 
2025 AGM, whichever is the sooner.

Changes in the Company’s share capital during 2023, including 
details of purchases and releases by the ASST, and the reissue of 
treasury shares during the year, together with details of options 
granted over unissued capital, are set out in notes 25 and 26 
to the consolidated financial statements.

Substantial shareholdings

As at 30 September 2023, and up to the date of this Report, the 
following information has been received in accordance with DTR 5,

The information provided above was correct at the date of notification 
but may have changed since. However, the holder is not required to 
make another notification to the Company until the next notifiable 
threshold (as defined in DTR 5) is crossed.

Employee share trusts

The Compass Group Employee Share Trust (ESOP) was established on 
13 January 1992 in connection with the Company’s share option 
plans. The Compass Group Long Term Incentive Plan Trust was 
established on 5 April 2001 in connection with the Company’s  
long-term incentive plans. In 2019, it was adapted to allow it to source 

shares for all the Company’s share schemes and renamed the 
Compass Group PLC All Share Schemes Trust.

Details of employee equity incentive schemes are set out in 
the Directors’ Remuneration report on pages 97 to 126. As at 
30 September 2023, the trustees of the ESOP and ASST held nil 
(2022: nil) and 573,223 (2022: 221,909) ordinary shares of the 
Company respectively.

Awards under employee share schemes

Details of awards made during the year and held by executive 
directors as at 30 September 2023 are disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration report on pages 97 to 126.

Details of employee equity incentive schemes and grants made during 
the year ended 30 September 2023, and extant awards held by 
employees are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements on 
pages 197 and 198.

Employee engagement

Compass places particular importance on engaging with employees, 
recognising that its people are vital in delivering the Group’s 
commitments and strategy and to living its values. Employee 
engagement is based on commitments to respect, teamwork and 
growth within the workforce. Senior leaders across the Group meet 
with their teams through roundtables, townhalls and site visits. Mobile 
apps are used to communicate directly with front line staff, and 
webcasts, blogs, newsletters, in-house publications and other 
communication channels are also deployed to share relevant 
information and invite comments and questions. These channels 
provide mechanisms to keep employees regularly informed on matters 
of concern to them as employees, and to promote a common 
awareness of the financial, economic and environmental factors 
affecting the performance of the Company. In the European Economic 
Area (EEA), Group businesses are represented on Compass Group’s 
European Works Council (EWC). Employees from across the Group’s 
EEA business have been elected to employee representative roles on 
the EWC which provides a forum for exchanging information and 
engaging in consultation on the Group’s performance and plans, and 
relevant transnational issues affecting those countries in the EEA. In 
the Group’s North America business, employees participate 
in Compass Community Councils and zone meetings which provide 
forums for employees across multiple sectors in the same geographic 
location to exchange best practices. Employees regularly share 
feedback about how it feels to work at Compass through engagement 
surveys. These provide management with useful information that 
helps the businesses to form a good understanding of how employees 
feel about their workplace and to understand what more can be done 
to make Compass a great place to work.

Certain employees globally are eligible to participate in the Company’s 
share schemes, details of which are published on pages 197 and 198, 
and UK-based employees are eligible to participate in the Company’s 
Share Incentive Plan.

The directors maintain oversight of employee matters through the 
Board and committee meeting processes and information flows, 
including regular updates on employee matters and feedback 
received through employee engagement surveys. The DNED for 
workforce engagement maintains close links with colleagues 
tasked with employee engagement across the Group, holds 
roundtable meetings, is available for direct engagement with 
employee groups, and feeds back relevant information and issues 
to the Board. How the directors have engaged with employees and 
have considered their interests when taking key decisions is further 
detailed on pages 71,75 and 81.

The Group continues to operate on a decentralised basis. This 
provides a foundation for an entrepreneurial approach balanced by a 
rigorous control framework exercised by a small head office team.

inclusion, whilst playing our part in shaping a sustainable future for 
our people, the communities in which we operate and the planet. 

Our people are instrumental to the success of the Group. The 
individuality and diversity that every employee brings to the Group are 
respected and valued, and relationships with employees are based on 
respect for the dignity of the individual and fair treatment for all. 
The Company publishes an annual statement in accordance with 
the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and a copy 
of the statement is available on the Company’s website,  
www.compass-group.com.

As at 30 September 2023, there were 562,460 (2022: 513,707) 
people employed by the Group (average number of employees 
including directors and part-time employees) of whom 316,474 were 
female (2022: 290,778) and 245,986 were male (2022: 222,929). 
496 were senior managers, of whom 170 were female and 326 were 
male (2022: 165 female and 349 male), which includes members of 
our global leadership team and statutory directors of corporate 
entities whose financial information is consolidated in the 
Group’s financial statements in this Annual Report.

As at 30 September 2023, there were 13 directors, eight of whom 
were male and five were female. Prior to any appointment to the 
Board, the Nomination Committee gives due regard to diversity and 
gender with a view to recommending the appointment of the most 
suitable candidate for the role.

Compass seeks to create a positive and open working environment. 
Employee policies are set locally to comply with local law within an 
overall Group framework, and employee satisfaction and engagement 
are monitored through a number of key performance indicators.

Consideration is given to the concerns of the wider communities in 
which the Group’s businesses operate, including national and local 
interests, and utilising relevant expertise to help contribute to the 
wellbeing of communities in ways which are appropriate to the 
Group’s business objectives. Furthermore, the Group supports the 
rights of all people as set out in the UN Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights (UN Declaration) and considers carefully before doing 
any business in countries that do not adhere to the UN Declaration.

Business relationships

The directors regard positive business relationships with suppliers, 
clients, consumers and others as critical to the Company’s long-term 
success. The Group’s culture, values and behaviours support open 
and honest engagement with its stakeholders. High standards of 
ethical behaviour and probity are maintained in all Compass’ business 
dealings. For further information on how the Company fosters 
business relationships and how the directors have had regard to 
stakeholders’ interests in their principal decision-making processes 
see pages 74 to 81.

Local management teams are responsible for maintaining high 
standards of health and safety and for ensuring that there is 
appropriate employee involvement in decision-making.

Employee benefits and policies

Eligible employees in the UK are invited to join the Company’s defined 
contribution pension arrangement, Compass Retirement Income 
Savings Plan (CRISP). CRISP has a corporate trustee, CRISP Trustees 
Limited. The Chair, Nigel Palmer, and the other six trustee directors 
are current or former employees of Compass Group Holdings PLC or 
Compass Group, UK and Ireland Limited. Three of the employee 
directors were nominated as directors of the corporate trustee by 
CRISP members.

Those UK employees who transferred from the public sector under 
TUPE were, typically up until 31 March 2015, eligible to join the 
Compass Group Pension Plan (the Plan), a defined benefit pension 
arrangement which has otherwise been closed to new entrants since 
2003. However, in accordance with the Government’s revised 
guidance for ‘Fair Deal for staff pensions’, the approach has been to 
continue participation in the relevant public sector pension scheme 
and so the Plan is closed to future entrants. The Plan also has a 
corporate trustee, Compass Group Pension Trustee Company Limited. 
The board of the corporate trustee comprises Philip Whittome, 
independent Chair, one other independent trustee director, and five 
directors that are UK-based employees or former employees of 
Compass Group Holdings PLC or Compass Group, UK and Ireland 
Limited. Three of the employee directors were nominated as directors 
of the corporate trustee by Plan members.

The Group has proposed a transfer of CRISP into the Plan and for 
CRISP to operate as a separate defined contribution section of the 
Plan. The combined board of the Plan following the transfer will 
include trustee directors from both arrangements.

The Company is subject to the Pension Automatic Enrolment 
Regulations for its workforce in the UK. All new UK employees who 
meet the statutory eligibility criteria, and who do not join CRISP, are 
automatically enrolled into the National Employment Savings Trust 
(NEST). Responsibility for the Group’s ongoing compliance with the 
Pension Automatic Enrolment Regulations and for ensuring that the 
administration and investment of funds relating to automatic 
enrolment remain appropriate lies with the Group’s Pension 
Automatic Enrolment Governance Committee.

Permanent employees outside the UK are usually offered membership 
of local pension arrangements, if and where they exist, and where it is 
appropriate to have Company-sponsored arrangements.

Employees are offered a range of benefits, such as private 
medical cover, depending on the local environment. Priority is given to 
the training of employees and the development of their skills. 
Employment of people with disabilities is considered on merit with 
regard only to the ability of any applicant to carry out the role. 
Arrangements to enable people with disabilities to carry out the duties 
required will be made if it is reasonable to do so. An employee who 
becomes disabled would, where appropriate, be offered retraining.

Employee diversity and human rights

Our Code of Business Conduct (CBC) was refreshed and re-launched 
in June 2023. It provides principles-based guidance to help our 
businesses do what’s right and sets out clearly the standards of 
behaviours that we expect. Our values, CBC and Group policies serve 
as a foundation for how we conduct business and compete fairly, 
globally. Together, they underpin our environmental, social and 
governance activities including incorporating the Ten Principles of the 
UN Global Compact, of which Compass has been a participant since 
2004, into strategies, policies, and procedures. This demonstrates 
Compass’ commitment to continue fostering a culture of integrity and

Non-financial reporting directive

Donations and political expenditure

The Companies, Partnerships and Groups (Accounts and Non-
Financial Reporting) Regulations 2016 (the Regulations) require 
companies to disclose non-financial information necessary to 
provide investors and other stakeholders with a better understanding 
of a company’s development, performance, position and impact of 
its activity. The Audit Committee, which advises the Board on 
such matters, has concluded that the Company is compliant 
with the Regulations.

Throughout this Annual Report the directors have disclosed a mix of 
financial and non-financial KPIs that they believe best reflect the 
Group’s strategic priorities and will help convey an understanding 
of the Group’s culture and the drivers contributing to the ongoing 
success of the Company. The non-financial and sustainability 
information statement on page 55 identifies where information 
relating to non-financial matters can be found.

Post balance sheet events

With effect from 1 October 2023, the reporting currency of the Group 
was changed from sterling to US dollars.

On 2 October 2023, the Group sold its business in Argentina.

In the period from 1 October to 20 November 2023, 6,357,210 
shares were repurchased for a total price of £130 million excluding 
transaction costs under the £750 million share buyback announced 
in May 2023.

On 2 November 2023, the Group entered into an agreement to 
acquire Hofmann Menü-Manufaktur GmbH, a leading German 
manufacturer and supplier of ‘cook and freeze’ meals, for €270m 
(£234m), subject to regulatory approval which we expect to receive 
during the first half of the 2024 financial year.

On 20 November 2023, a final dividend in respect of the financial year 
ended 30 September 2023 of 28.1 pence per share, £482 million 
(based on issued share capital excluding treasury shares as at 
30 September 2023) in aggregate, was proposed.

Greenhouse gas emissions reporting

The Company is required to state the annual quantity of emissions in 
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from activities for which the Group 
is responsible, including the combustion of fuel and the operation of 
directly controlled facilities. Details of our emissions during the year 
ended 30 September 2023 are set out within the Purpose section of 
the Strategic Report on page 42 and form part of the Directors’ Report 
disclosures and are incorporated by reference. Further details of the 
Group’s actions to reduce emissions can also be found in the Purpose 
and TCFD sections of this Annual Report on pages 38 to 54. This 
Annual Report is certified as a CarbonNeutral® publication, supporting 
an emissions reduction project to offset the emissions arising from the 
production, printing and delivery of this Report. This year, the 
Company has supported a community-based project in Bangladesh, 
which trains and works with micro-entrepreneurs to help them 
produce and distribute clean cooking stoves designed to deliver 
significant emissions reductions, address the health risks of indoor 
pollution and reduce wood fuel consumption, relieving pressure on 
local forests and biodiversity.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

In accordance with the requirements of the UK Listing Rules, the 
Company is required to state whether it has made disclosures 
consistent with the TCFD’s recommendations, or if not, to provide an 
explanation of why it has not complied and a description of the steps 
that are being taken or will be taken to enable the Company to make 
consistent disclosures in the future and the timeframe for compliance. 
Details of Compass’ TCFD progress and compliance are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 45 to 54 and form part of the Directors’ 
report disclosures and are incorporated by reference.

Charitable objectives support the Company’s corporate responsibility 
strategy and have primarily focused on the environment, education, 
health and wellbeing, community engagement and responsible 
business practice. Donations have included employee involvement 
through fundraising and financial support.

Since 2004, shareholders have passed an annual resolution, on a 
precautionary basis, to approve donations to EU political organisations 
and to incur political expenditure (as such terms were defined under 
the then relevant legislation) not exceeding a monetary limit approved 
by shareholders. The Board has consistently confirmed that it 
operates a policy of not giving any cash contribution to any political 
party in the ordinary meaning of those words and that it has no 
intention of changing that policy.

No material amount of corporate funds or paid employee time 
has been utilised during the year for political activities and, 
in accordance with the Company’s CBC, employees must not 
engage in any form of lobbying or have contact with political 
representatives, government employees or public interest groups 
unless they are doing so legitimately and adhering to internal control 
processes. Further information regarding the CBC can be found on 
pages 13 and 84 of this Annual Report and on the Company’s website,  
www.compass-group.com.

The directors propose to renew the authority last granted at the 2023 
AGM for the Group to make political donations and incur political 
expenditure (as such terms are defined in sections 362 to 365 of the 
CA 2006) until the Company’s next AGM, which they might otherwise 
be prohibited from making or incurring under the terms of the CA 
2006 and which would not amount to ‘donations’ in the ordinary 
sense of the word. It is proposed to maintain the limit of such 
authority at £100,000.

CREST

The Company’s ordinary shares and sterling Eurobonds are in CREST, 
the settlement system for stocks and shares.

Disclosures required under LR 9.8.4

There are no disclosures required to be made under the FCA’s Listing 
Rules LR 9.8.4 which have not already been disclosed elsewhere in 
this Report. Details of long-term incentive plans can be found in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on pages 97 to 126 and details of 
dividends waived by shareholders can be found on page 127.

AGM

The Notice of Meeting setting out the resolutions to be proposed at 
the 2024 AGM, together with explanatory notes, will be sent to 
shareholders as a separate document and made available on the 
Company’s website, www.compass-group.com.

The directors consider that each of the resolutions is in the best 
interests of the Company and the shareholders as a whole and 
recommend that shareholders vote in favour of all the resolutions.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
annual report and the financial statements

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of 
the Group’s profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements, the directors 
are required to:

 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 

consistently

 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, 

reliable and prudent

 – for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 

been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international 
accounting standards

 – for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 

applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company financial statements

 – assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern

 – use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 

intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ report, 
Directors’ Remuneration report and Corporate Governance Statement 
that comply with that law and those regulations.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. In accordance with Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.1.16R, the financial statements will form 
part of the annual financial report prepared under DTR 4.1.17R and 
4.1.18R. The auditor’s report on these financial statements provides 
no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been 
prepared in accordance with those requirements.

Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with UK accounting standards and 
applicable law, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.

Disclosure of relevant audit information

The directors confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which its auditor, KPMG, is unaware and 
each director has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as 
a director to be aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that KPMG is aware of that information.

to the members of Compass Group PLC

1. Our opinion is unmodified

In our opinion:

2. Overview of Our Audit

Factors driving our view of risks 

 – the financial statements of Compass Group PLC give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs 
as at 30 September 2023, and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;

 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 

accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards;

 – the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 

prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and

 – the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006. 

What our opinion covers

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements 
of Compass Group PLC (“the Company”) for the year ended 
30 September 2023 included in the Annual Report, which comprise: 

Group
 – Consolidated Income Statement
 – Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
 – Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity
 – Consolidated Balance Sheet
 – Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
 – Notes 1 to 36 to the Group financial statements, including the 

accounting policies included within the respective notes

Parent Company (Compass Group PLC)
 – Parent Company Balance Sheet
 – Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity
 – Notes 1 to 8 to the Parent Company financial statements, 

including the accounting policies

Basis for opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. 
Our audit opinion and matters included in this report are consistent 
with those discussed and included in our reporting to the Audit 
Committee (“AC”). 

We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain 
independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical 
requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to 
listed public interest entities. 

Following our 2022 audit and considering the developments affecting 
the Group since then, our assessment of audit risks remains similar to 
2022 for key audit matters previously identified. 

The UK business has continued to recover its trading performance 
with both revenue and operating profit improving from prior year. 
Estimation uncertainty in relation to the assumptions used in the 
impairment review remains elevated as a result of persistence of input 
cost inflation and an increase in interest rates leading to a higher 
discount rate. We therefore consider that the risk associated with 
goodwill impairment in respect of the UK cash-generating unit as a 
whole, continues to be heightened, consistent with 2022. 

Tax authorities around the world continue to provide a high level of 
scrutiny of transfer pricing arrangements. We therefore consider that 
the risk associated with uncertain direct tax positions as a whole, 
continues to be heightened, consistent with 2022. 

Our assessment is that the risk of recoverability of the Parent 
Company’s investments in subsidiaries and amounts owed by 
Group undertakings remains consistent with 2022.

During the year, the AC met three times. KPMG are invited to 
attend all AC meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet 
with the AC in private sessions without the executive directors being 
present. For each key audit matter, we have set out communications 
with the AC in section 4, including matters that required particular 
judgement for each. 

The matters included in the Audit Committee Report on page 83 
are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.

Our Independence

We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain 
independent of the Group in accordance with UK ethical 
requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed public interest entities.

Apart from the matters noted below, we have not performed 
any non-audit services during the financial year ended 
30 September 2023 or subsequently which are prohibited by 
the FRC Ethical Standard.

During 2023 we identified that certain KPMG member firms had 
provided preparation of local GAAP financial statement services over 
the periods ending September 2017 to 2023 to some group entities 
which are and have been residual components and therefore not in 
scope for the Group audit. The services, which have been terminated, 
were administrative in nature and did not involve any management 
decision-making or bookkeeping. The work in each case had no 
direct or indirect effect on Compass Group PLC’s consolidated 
financial statements. 

In our professional judgement, we confirm that based on our 
assessment of the breach, our integrity and objectivity as auditor 
has not been compromised and we believe that an objective, 
reasonable and informed third party would conclude that the 
provision of these services would not impair our integrity or 
objectivity for any of the impacted financial years. The Audit 
Committee concurred with this view.

We were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year 
ended 30 September 2014. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is for the 10 financial years ended 30 September 2023.

The Group engagement partner is required to rotate every five years. 
As these are the fifth set of the Group’s financial statements signed 
by Zulfikar Kamran Walji, he will be required to rotate off after the 
2023 audit.

The average tenure of partners responsible for component audits 
as set out in section 7 below is three years, with the shortest being one 
and the longest being five.

Materiality 

(ITEM 6 below)

The scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and 
our assessed risk of material misstatement. 

We have determined overall materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole at £74m (2022: £63m) and for the Parent 
Company financial statements as a whole at £49m (2022: £49m). 

Consistent with 2022, we determined that Group profit before tax 
remains the benchmark for the Group as it is most reflective of the 
business, being a profit-seeking company. As such, we based our 
Group materiality on Group profit before tax, of which it represents 
4.2% (2022: 4.3%). 

Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements was 
determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company 
total assets, of which it represents 0.3% (2022: 0.4%).

 The impact of climate change on our audit

In planning our audit, we considered the potential impacts of climate 
change on the Group’s business and its financial statements.

The Group has set out in the Strategic Report its commitment to 
reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the global 
value chain by 2050, to reach climate neutrality in the Group’s 
direct operations by 2030, and its commitment to several other 
shorter-term targets.

As part of our audit, we have performed a risk assessment, including 
enquiries of management, to understand how the impact of 
commitments made by the Group in respect of climate change, as well 
as the physical or transition risks of climate change, may affect the 
financial statements and our audit. There was no material impact from 
this work on our key audit matters.

Whilst the Group is still undertaking work to quantify and assess the 
potential impact of climate change on the business, based on the risk 
assessment procedures we performed, including reading the Group’s 
roadmap for transitioning to net zero GHGs, we did not identify any 
significant risk in this period of climate change having a material 
impact on the Group’s critical accounting estimates. This is due to the 
shorter-term nature of certain estimates (tax provisioning), the nature 
of the estimate itself (pension liabilities) and the level of headroom 
(impairment of goodwill and intangible assets). In addition, we did not 
identify any significant risks in this period to the carrying value and 
useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment caused by the 
projected physical risks of climate change or the transition to a net 
zero operating model.

We have read the disclosures of climate-related information in the 
Annual Report and considered their consistency with the financial 
statements and our audit knowledge. We have not been engaged to 
provide assurance over the accuracy of the climate risk disclosures in 
the Annual Report.

Group scope 

(ITEM 7 below)

We have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to 
determine which of the Group’s components are likely to include risks 
of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the type 
of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of 
involvement required from our component auditors around the world.

Of the Group’s 49 (2022: 51) reporting components, we subjected 
15 (2022:15) to full scope audits for Group purposes. 

The components within the scope of our work accounted for the 
percentages illustrated below.

In addition, we have performed Group-level analysis on the remaining 
components to determine whether further risks of material 
misstatement exist in those components. 

We consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit 
Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.

Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability

Our responsibility 
We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a 
material inconsistency between the directors’ disclosures in respect of 
emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the 
financial statements and our audit knowledge. 

Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to: 

 – the directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on page 31 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; 
 – the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how 

emerging risks are identified, and explaining how they are being 
managed and mitigated; and 

 – the directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have 
done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions. 

We are also required to review the viability statement set out on page 
31 under the Listing Rules.

Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only 
the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we 
cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent 
events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements 
that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of 
anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and Parent Company’s longer-term viability.

Our reporting
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to 
these disclosures.

We have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent 
with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.

3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and 
uncertainties

The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going 
concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the 
Parent Company or to cease their operations, and as they have 
concluded that the Group’s and the Parent Company’s financial 
position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that 
there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant 
doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern over the period 
to 31 March 2025 (“the going concern period”).

Going concern

We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry and the general 
economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business 
model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s financial resources or ability to continue operations 
over the going concern period. The risk that we considered most likely 
to adversely affect the Group’s available financial resources and/or 
metrics relevant to debt covenants over this period was the impact of 
elevated input cost inflation on the Group’s performance and the 
ability of the Group to mitigate and recover the medium-term impact 
of persistent inflation.

We also considered less predictable but realistic second-order 
impacts, such as a significant decline in volumes as a consequence of 
a global economic downturn.

We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity 
or covenant compliance in the going concern period by comparing 
severe but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these 
risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial 
resources and covenants indicated by the Group’s financial forecasts.

We considered whether the going concern disclosure on page 151 of 
the Group financial statements gives a full and accurate description of 
the directors’ assessment of going concern, including the identified 
risks and related sensitivities.

Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors’ use 
of the going concern basis of accounting without any material 
uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable. 
However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as 
subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with 
judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the 
above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent 
Company will continue in operation.

Our conclusions
 – We consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of 

accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is 
appropriate;

 – We have not identified, and concur with the directors’ assessment 

that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or 
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant 
doubt on the Group’s or Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern for the going concern period;

 – We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to 

the directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements on the 
use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and 
Parent Company’s use of that basis for the going concern period, 
and we found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be 
acceptable; and

 – The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 21 is 
materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit 
knowledge.

4. Key audit matters

What we mean

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: 

 – the overall audit strategy; 
 – the allocation of resources in the audit; and
 – directing the efforts of the engagement team.

We include below the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those matters 
and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, for the purpose of 
our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Consistent with 2022, estimation uncertainty in relation to

Description of the key audit matter

Our response to the risk

Forecast-based assessment: 
The Group has a significant carrying amount of goodwill which 
is spread across a range of cash-generating units (CGUs) in 
different countries. 

We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the 
Group’s controls because the nature of the balance is such that we 
would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed 
procedures described.

The value-in-use calculation for the CGUs, which represents the 
estimated recoverable amount, is subjective due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting estimated future 
cash flows (specifically the key assumptions such as revenue, 
operating margin, long-term growth rate and discount rate). 

Our procedures to address the risk included:

 – Historical comparisons: We assessed the Group’s ability to forecast 
accurately by comparing assumptions made in historic forecasts to 
actual results achieved;

 – Our sector experience: We critically assessed the Group’s 

Estimation uncertainty in relation to the UK business remains high as 
a result of persistence of input cost inflation and an increase in 
interest rates leading to a higher discount rate.

assumptions on revenue and operating profit margin taking account of 
strategic plans approved by the Board, our wider knowledge of the 
industry and the performance of other comparable CGUs;

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we 
determined that the carrying amount of the UK CGU has a 
high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of 
reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. 

The financial statements (note 9) disclose the sensitivity estimated by 
the Group. These disclosures give relevant information about the 
estimation uncertainty including the risk of a reduction in the 
headroom or need for an impairment as a result of a reasonably 
possible change in one or more of the key assumptions.

Communications with Compass Group PLC’s Audit Committee
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee 
included:

 – Our audit approach as set out above, including not seeking to rely 

on any of the Group’s controls, and the involvement of our 
valuation specialists;

 – Our conclusions from the procedures performed; and
 – Our views on the disclosures included in the financial statements 
with respect to the UK CGU and the sensitivity of the impairment 
conclusions to reasonably possible changes in assumptions.

We used our valuations experts to challenge the appropriateness of 
discount rate by deriving our own independent range;

 – Benchmarking assumptions: We challenged the Group’s long-term 
growth rate assumption by corroborating this to external data sources;

 – Sensitivity analysis: We performed sensitivity analysis on the key 

assumptions noted above to identify the extent to which changes in 
those assumptions could give risk to an impairment;

 – Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the Group’s 

disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment 
assessment to a reasonably possible change in key assumptions 
reflects the risks inherent in the estimation of the recoverable amount 
of goodwill.

Area of particular auditor judgement 
We identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:

 – The estimate is particularly sensitive to key assumptions in the 

impairment model including revenue growth rates, operating profit 
margins, long-term growth rates and discount rates and auditor 
judgement is required to assess whether the directors’ overall 
estimate falls within an acceptable range. 

Our results
We found the Group’s conclusion that there is no impairment of the UK 
CGU’s goodwill to be acceptable (2022: acceptable) and we found the 
sensitivity disclosures made to be acceptable (2022: acceptable).

Committee considered goodwill impairment in respect of the UK CGU as an area of significant attention, page 162 for the accounting policy on

Description of the key audit matter

Our response to the risk

 Subjective estimate:
The Group operates across a large number of jurisdictions and is 
subject to periodic challenges by local tax authorities on a range 
of tax matters during the normal course of business, including 
transfer pricing. 

We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the 
Group’s controls because the small number of transactions meant 
that detailed testing is inherently the most effective means of 
obtaining audit evidence.

Our procedures to address the risk included:

As a result of the complexities of tax rules on transfer pricing 
and other tax legislation, the provisioning for uncertain direct tax 
positions is judgemental and requires the directors to make estimates 
in relation to these uncertainties.

The directors’ estimation includes assessing the likelihood of 
potentially material exposures as a result of changes in local tax 
regulations and evaluating ongoing inspections by local tax 
authorities and international bodies, which could materially 
impact the amounts recorded in the Group financial statements.

Communications with Compass Group PLC’s Audit Committee
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee 
included:

 – Our audit approach as set out above, including not seeking to rely 

on any of the Group’s controls and the involvement of our 
taxation specialists;

 – Our conclusions from the procedures performed; and
 – Our views on the disclosures of the direct tax provisions 

disclosed.

 – Our taxation expertise: With the assistance of our tax specialists, we 
analysed and challenged the assumptions used to determine the 
provisions recognised using our knowledge and experience of the 
application of international and local legislation by the relevant 
authorities and courts and assessing whether the approach applied by 
the Group is supported by custom and practice.

 – With the help of our tax specialists we considered whether the 
judgements applied to each significant provision, including the 
maximum potential exposure and the likelihood of a payment being 
required, were appropriate.

 – Tests of detail: We examined the calculations prepared by the 
directors and agreed key assumptions used to underlying data.
 – We inspected correspondence with relevant tax authorities and 

assessed third-party tax advice received by the directors to evaluate 
the conclusions drawn in the advice where relevant to the significant 
exposures faced by the Group, and how these have been used by the 
directors in their assessment of the likelihood of any outflow and 
estimate of the provision.

 – Assessing transparency: We assessed the adequacy of the Group’s 

disclosures in respect of tax and uncertain direct tax positions.

Area of particular auditor judgement 
We identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:

The assessment of the outcome of investigations by the authorities, if a 
liability exists and in making an estimate of any economic outflows. 

Our results
We found the level of tax provisioning to be acceptable (2022: 
acceptable).

Committee considered direct tax provisions as an area of significant attention, page 158 for the accounting policy on tax and note 6 for the

Description of the key audit matter

Our response to the risk

Low risk, high value: 
The carrying amount of the Parent Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries and intercompany receivables represents 97%  
(2022: 88%) of the Company’s total assets.

We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the 
Company’s controls because the nature of the balance is such that we 
would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed 
procedures described.

We do not consider the recoverability of these investments and 
intercompany receivables to be at a high risk of significant 
misstatement, or to be subject to a significant level of judgement. 
However, due to their materiality in the context of the Parent Company 
financial statements as a whole, this is considered to be the area which 
had the greatest effect on our overall Parent Company audit.

Communications with Compass Group PLC’s Audit Committee
Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:

 – Our audit approach as set out above; and
 – Our conclusions from the procedures performed.

Area of particular auditor judgement 
 – We did not identify any areas of particular auditor judgement. 

Our procedures to address the risk included:

 – Test of detail: We compared a sample of the investment and 

intercompany receivables’ carrying amounts to the net assets of 
the relevant subsidiary included within the Group consolidation, 
to identify whether the net asset value, being an approximation 
of the minimum recoverable amount, was in excess of their carrying 
amount, and whether, therefore, there was coverage of the 
debt owed.

When the net assets of the relevant subsidiary were insufficient to 
support the carrying value, we considered the performance of the 
underlying investments held by the relevant subsidiary in order to 
assess whether there was an indication of impairment.

 – Assessing subsidiary net assets: For the relevant subsidiaries 

(investment holding companies), we compared the net assets of the 
relevant subsidiary to the final net assets in the prior year audited 
financial statements. Based on the knowledge acquired during the 
audit of the consolidated Group, including reporting received from 
component auditors for the underlying trading operations, we 
considered whether there were any events indicating that the net 
assets would be materially different from the prior year position. 

Our results
We found the Parent Company’s conclusion that there is no 
impairment of its investment in subsidiaries and amount owned 
by Group undertaking to be acceptable (2022: acceptable).

undertakings and notes 2 and 3 for the financial disclosures.

5. Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response 

Fraud — Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud 

Fraud risk assessment 

To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could 
indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud.

Our risk assessment procedures included:

 – Enquiring of directors, the Audit Committee and Internal Audit, and inspection of policy documentation as to 

the Group’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the Internal Audit 
function and the Group’s channel for ‘whistleblowing’, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, 
suspected, or alleged fraud.

 – Reading Board, Audit and Corporate Responsibility Committee meeting minutes. 
 – Considering remuneration incentive schemes (primarily the annual bonus plan) and performance targets for 
management and directors including revenue, operating profit margin and cash flow targets for management 
remuneration.

 – Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.
 – Using our own forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the 

circumstances of the Group.

We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud 
throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to component audit teams of 
relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to component audit teams to report to the Group 
audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.

As required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets and our 
overall knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override 
of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition, in particular the risk that Group and component 
management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries. 

We did not identify any additional fraud risks.

Risk communications

Fraud risks

Procedures to address  
fraud risks

In determining the audit procedures, we took into account the results of our evaluation of some of the Group-wide 
fraud risk management controls.

We performed procedures including:

 – Identifying journal entries and other adjustments to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified 

entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted by senior management and those posted to 
unexpected account pairings.

 – Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.

Laws and regulations — Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement relating to compliance with laws and regulations

Laws and regulations

Risk communications

Direct laws context  
and link to audit

Most significant indirect 
law/regulation areas

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the 
financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience and through discussion with the 
directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s 
regulatory and legal correspondence; and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and 
procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of 
non- compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to component 
audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for component auditors to 
report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a 
material misstatement at Group.

Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements, including financial 
reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation 
legislation, and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures 
on the related financial statement items.

Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance 
could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the 
imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: health 
and safety (food and employees), anti-bribery, data privacy, competition and employment law. Auditing standards 
limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the 
directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a 
breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not 
detect that breach.

Context

Context of the ability of 
the audit to detect 
fraud or breaches of law 
or regulation

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some 
material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our 
audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and 
regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently 
limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained 
a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material 
misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect 
non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

6. Our determination of materiality

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to 
help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole. 

£74m (2022: £63m)

What we mean

Materiality for the 
Group financial 
statements as a 
whole

£55.5m  
(2022: £47.2m)

Performance 
materiality

A quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.

Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied

Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £74m (2022: £63m). This was determined 
with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before tax from continuing operations (PBTCO). 

Consistent with 2022, we determined that PBTCO remains the main benchmark for the Group considering the 
sector in which it operates, its ownership and financing structure, and the focus of users of the financial 
statements. As such, we based our Group materiality on PBTCO of £1,747m (2022: £1,469m).

Our Group materiality of £74m was determined by applying a percentage to the PBTCO. When using a benchmark 
of PBTCO to determine overall materiality, KPMG’s approach for listed entities considers a guideline range of 
3% to 5% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.2% (2022: 4.3%) 
to the benchmark. 

Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at £49m (2022: £49m), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets, of which it represents 0.3% (2022: 0.4%).

What we mean

Our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, 
performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements 
in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.

Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied

We have considered performance materiality at a level of 75% (2022: 75%) of materiality for Compass Group PLC 
Group financial statements as a whole to be appropriate. 

The Parent Company performance materiality was set at £36.7m (2022: £36.7m), which equates to 75% (2022: 
75%) of materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole. 

We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any 
factors indicating an elevated level of risk.

£3.7m (2022: £3.1m)

What we mean

Audit misstatement 
posting threshold

This is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative 
point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing 
and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud. 

This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Compass Group PLC’s 
Audit Committee.

Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied

We set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (2022: 5%) of our materiality for the Group financial 
statements. We also report to the Audit Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on 
qualitative grounds.

7. The scope of our audit

Group scope 

What we mean

How the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.

The Group has 49 (2021: 51) reporting components. In order to determine the work performed at the reporting 
component level, we identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, 
those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to 
be performed to provide us with the evidence we required in order to conclude on the Group financial statements 
as a whole.

We determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 10% (2022: 10%) of 
Group revenue or Group total assets. We selected Group revenue and Group total assets because these are the 
most representative of the relative size of the components. We identified 1 (2022: 1) component as an individually 
financially significant component and performed a full scope audit on this component. 

In addition to the individually financially significant component, we identified 1 (2022: 1) component as 
significant, owing to significant risk of material misstatement affecting the Group financial statements. We 
performed a full scope audit on this component.

In addition, to enable us to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the Group financial statements as a 
whole, we selected 13 (2022: 13) components on which to perform full scope audit procedures. 

The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group’s results, with 
the prior year comparatives indicated in brackets:

Scope

materiality applied

£11.1m - £62.9m  
(£5m - £51m)

90% (89%)

93% (90%)

90% (90%)

The remaining 10% (2022: 11%) of Group revenue, 7% (2022: 10%) of Group profit before tax and 10% (2022: 
10%) of total Group assets is represented by 34 (2022: 36) reporting components, none of which individually 
represented more than 2% (2022: 3%) of any of Group revenue, Group profit before tax or total Group assets. For 
these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.

The work on 12 of the 15 components (2022: 12 of the 15 components) was performed by component auditors 
and the rest, including the audit of the Parent Company, was performed by the Group team. 

The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant 
risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component 
materiality levels, as detailed in the table above, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components. 

In addition, we have performed Group-level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further 
risks of material misstatement exist in those components.

The scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the 
Group’s internal control over financial reporting.

Group audit team  
oversight

What we mean

The extent of the Group audit team’s involvement in component audits. 

In working with component auditors, we:

 – Held planning calls with all component audit teams to discuss the significant areas of the audit relevant to the 

components.

 – Issued Group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope of their work, including specifying the 
minimum procedures to perform in their audit of significant risk areas, including management override of 
controls and revenue recognition.

 – Held risk assessment update discussions with all component audit teams before the commencement of the 
final phases of the audit led by the Group engagement partner and engagement quality control partner.
 – Visited 4 (2022: 5) components in person as the audit progressed to understand and challenge the audit 
approach and organised regular video conferences with the Group and component audit teams. At these 
meetings and video conferences, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and 
any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component audit teams.

 – Inspected the component audit teams’ key work papers (using remote technology capabilities) to evaluate the 
quality of execution of the audits of the components, with a particular focus on work related to significant risks.

9. Respective responsibilities 

Directors’ responsibilities

As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 131, the 
directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; 
assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. In addition, the 
directors are responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s responsibilities 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s 
report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does 
not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of the financial statements. 

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 

The Company is required to include these financial statements in an 
annual financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting 
format specified in the TD ESEF Regulation. This auditor’s report 
provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has 
been prepared in accordance with that format.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2023 

1

Basis of preparation 

Introduction 

The consolidated financial statements of Compass Group PLC (the 
Company) have been prepared on a going concern basis, as discussed 
on page 151, in accordance with UK-adopted International 
Accounting Standards. The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by 
the revaluation of certain financial instruments. 

Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in sterling, which 
is the functional and reporting currency of the Company. 

The consolidated financial statements consolidate the results of the 
Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries), 
and include the Group’s share of the results of its interests in joint 
ventures and associates using the equity method. 

Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has control. Control 
exists when the Company has power over an entity, exposure to 
variable returns from its involvement with an entity and the ability to 
use its power over the entity to affect its returns. The existence and 
effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are also considered when assessing control.  

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting 
policies used in line with those used by the Group. 

The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective 
date of disposal, as appropriate. 

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation. Where a subsidiary transacts with a joint 
operation of the Group, profits or losses are eliminated to the extent of 
the Group’s interest in the relevant joint operation. 

In preparing the financial statements of individual companies within 
the Group, transactions in currencies other than the companies’ 
functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange on the dates 
of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the rates on the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on 
retranslation are included in the consolidated income statement for 
the year, except for where they arise on items taken directly to other 
comprehensive income, in which case they are also recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas 
operations (expressed in their functional currencies, being the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity 
operates) are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are 
classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. 
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expense in 
the period in which the operation is disposed of. 

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing exchange rate.  

Significant accounting policies 

The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are set out in the relevant notes. 
These policies have been applied consistently to all the years 
presented, unless otherwise stated. 

Significant accounting policies are indicated by the following icon: 

Significant accounting policy 

Changes in accounting policies 

There were no new accounting standards or amendments to existing 
standards effective in the current year that had a significant impact on 
the Group’s consolidated financial statements. There are a number of 
changes to accounting standards, effective in future years, which are 
not expected to significantly impact the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements.  

Judgements 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires 
management to make judgements in respect of the application of its 
accounting policies which impact the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses.  

Whilst there are no judgements that management considers to be 
critical in the preparation of these financial statements, there is a 
significant judgement in respect of the classification of cash payments 
relating to contract fulfilment assets in the cash flow statement (see 
note 11). 

Estimates 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires 
management to make estimates which impact the reported amounts 
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates are based 
on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. 

Sources of estimation uncertainty are indicated by the following icon: 

Source of estimation uncertainty 

Major sources of estimation uncertainty 

The Group’s major sources of estimation uncertainty are in relation to 
goodwill in the UK cash-generating unit and post-employment benefit 
obligations on the basis that a reasonably possible change in key 
assumptions could have a material effect on the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the next 12 months (see notes 9 and 24, 
respectively). 

Other sources of estimation uncertainty 

In addition to the major sources of estimation uncertainty, tax has 
been identified as another source of estimation uncertainty. Whilst 
this is not considered to be a major source of uncertainty as defined

Basis of preparation continued 

Climate change 

Climate change is identified as a principal risk as its impact on the 
environment may lead to issues around food sourcing and supply 
chain continuity in some of the Group’s markets (see page 26). The 
potential impact of climate change has been assessed with scenario 
analysis conducted in line with the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations (see pages 51 and 
52). In October 2021, the Group announced a commitment to reach 
climate net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its global 
operations and value chain by 2050 (see page 52). 

Climate change considerations are indicated by the following icon: 

Climate change 

The potential impact of climate change and the Group’s net zero 
commitments on the following areas has been considered: 

–  going concern (see below) and viability (see page 31) assessments  
–  tax (see note 6) 
–  goodwill (see note 9) 
–  other intangible assets (see note 10) 
–  post-employment benefits (see note 24) 

There was no impact on the reported amounts in the financial 
statements as a result of this review. 

Going concern 

The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic report on pages 2 to 55. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are discussed 
in the Financial review on pages 16 to 21.  

The directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis for the reasons stated below. 

At 30 September 2023, the Group’s financing arrangements included sterling and Euro bonds (£2,353m) and US dollar US Private 
Placement (USPP) notes (£851m). In addition, the Group had Revolving Credit Facilities of £2,000m, committed to August 2026, which 
were fully undrawn, and £680m of cash, net of overdrafts. At the date of approving these consolidated financial statements, the liquidity 
position of the Group has remained substantially unchanged. 

For the purposes of the going concern assessment, the directors have prepared monthly cash flow projections for the period to 
31 March 2025 (the assessment period) from the most recent three-year strategic plan approved by the Board in November 2023. 
We consider 18 months to be a reasonable period for the going concern assessment as it enables us to consider the potential impact of 
macroeconomic and geopolitical factors over an extended period.  

Debt maturities in the going concern period include a $352m (£288m) USPP note in October 2023, a €750m (£651m) Eurobond in 
July 2024 and a $100m (£82m) USPP note in December 2024. 

The USPP notes are subject to leverage and interest cover covenants which are tested on 31 March and 30 September each year. The Group 
met both covenants at 30 September 2023. The Group’s other financing arrangements do not contain any financial covenants. 

The cash flow projections show that the Group has significant headroom against its committed facilities and meets its financial covenant 
obligations under the USPP notes without any refinancing. 

The Group has performed a stress test against the base case to determine the performance level that would result in a reduction in 
headroom against its committed facilities to nil or a breach of its covenants. The Group’s committed facilities would be reached in the event 
that underlying operating profit reduced by more than 60% of the strategic plan level. The directors do not consider this scenario to be likely. 
The stress test assumes no share buybacks or new business acquisitions as mitigating actions, with the exception of the acquisition of 
Hofmann Menü-Manufaktur GmbH which was agreed on 2 November 2023 subject to regulatory approval (see note 33). 

Consequently, the directors are confident that the Group and Parent Company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet their liabilities as 
they fall due for at least the period to 31 March 2025 and, therefore, have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis. 

Climate change  

  Climate change and the Group’s net zero commitments are not expected to have a material impact during the going concern period.

Segmental analysis 

Significant accounting policy  

Segmental information 
The segmental information presented is consistent with management reporting provided to the Executive Committee (the chief operating 
decision maker). The Executive Committee monitors the underlying revenue and operating profit of its three geographical segments, North 
America, Europe and Rest of World, to assess performance and allocate resources. The Group also has a separate segment for central 
activities which includes costs in respect of central functions, including finance, legal, commercial, IT and human resources. Underlying 
revenue and operating profit are reconciled to GAAP measures below. Finance costs and income tax expense are managed on a Group basis. 

Revenue 
Revenue represents income derived from contracts for the provision of food and support services by the Group to customers in exchange for 
consideration in the normal course of business. The Group’s revenue is comprised of revenues under its contracts with clients. Clients 
engage the Group to provide food and support services at their locations. Depending on the type of client and service, we are paid either by 
our client and/or directly by the consumers to whom we have been provided access by our client, such as the client’s employees, visitors, 
pupils, patients and spectators. Payment terms are set at contract level and vary according to country, sector and individual client. 

Performance obligations 
At contract inception, the contract is assessed to identify each promise to transfer either a distinct good or service or a series of distinct 
goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Goods and services are distinct and 
accounted for as separate performance obligations in the contract if the customer can benefit from them either on their own or together with 
other resources that are readily available to the customer and they are separately identifiable in the contract.  

Transaction price 
The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised 
goods and services to the customer, excluding value added tax and similar sales taxes. For example, the transaction price may be based on a 
price per meal, which may vary with volume, or could be based on costs incurred plus an agreed management fee. 

The Group makes a variety of ongoing payments to clients, mainly commissions, concession rentals and reimbursement of utility costs. 
These are assessed for treatment as consideration paid to customers, and where they are not in exchange for a distinct good or service, 
they are recognised as a reduction of the transaction price. In addition, the Group may make a payment to a client typically at the start of a 
contract which is not an investment in service assets and does not generate or enhance the Group’s resources. Such payments are reported 
as prepayments and, as they are not considered to be in exchange for a distinct good or service, they are charged to the income statement as 
a deduction to revenue recognised over the contract term rather than as an operating cost. 

Revenue recognition 
The Group recognises revenue when its performance obligations are satisfied as control of the goods and services is transferred to the client 
and/or consumers. In certain cases, clients engage the Group to provide food and support services in a single multi-service contract. 
Revenue is recognised for each separate performance obligation in respect of food and support services as these are provided. There is little 
judgement involved in determining if a performance obligation has been satisfied. 

For each performance obligation in a contract, the Group determines whether it is satisfied over time or at a point in time. 

The Group has determined that most of its performance obligations are satisfied over time as the client simultaneously receives and 
consumes the benefits provided as the food and/or support services are rendered at the client site. Generally, where the Group has the 
obligation to its clients to make available the provision of food service for a predetermined period, its performance obligation represents a 
series of services delivered over time. Revenue is recognised at the amount which the Group has the right to invoice, where that amount 
corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Group’s performance completed to date. Where the Group is contracted to sell 
directly to consumers, for example, in a retail café concession, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time, namely when the 
products are sold to the consumer. 

The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows for performance obligations within a contract that are satisfied over 
time and at a point in time are considered to be similar and they are affected by the same economic factors. 

Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated after the share of profit after tax of joint ventures and associates, and before finance costs. 

Specific adjusting items 
Specific adjusting items are disclosed and described separately in the consolidated financial statements where it is necessary to do so to 
provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. Specific adjusting items are material items of income or expense 
that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount. Further details are provided in note 34.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2023 continued

Tax 

Significant accounting policy 

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement except where it relates to 
items taken directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or equity, in which case it is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income or equity as appropriate. 

Current tax 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
in respect of that period at the balance sheet date. Tax benefits are recognised if it is probable that these will be accepted by the relevant tax 
authorities. Subsequently, they are reviewed each year to assess whether provisions against full recognition of the benefits are necessary. 

Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. 

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 

Deferred tax is calculated at the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset realised. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and the 
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 

Other source of estimation uncertainty 

  The Group has operations in approximately 35 countries. The tax position in each country is often not agreed with the tax authorities until some 
time after the relevant period end and, if subject to a tax audit, may be open for an extended period. In these circumstances, the recognition of 
tax liabilities and assets requires management estimation to reflect a variety of factors, including historical experience, interpretations of tax 
law and the likelihood of settlement.  

The international corporate tax environment remains complex and the sustained increase in audit activity from tax authorities means that the 
potential for tax uncertainties and disputes remains high. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were 
initially recorded, such differences will impact the results in the year in which such determination is made. In addition, the calculation and 
recognition of temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets requires estimates to be made of the extent to which future taxable profits 
are available against which these temporary differences can be utilised. 

Uncertain tax positions 
Tax risk can arise from unclear regulations and differences in interpretation but, most significantly, where tax authorities apply diverging 
standards in assessing intra-group cross-border transactions. The Group has recognised provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions, none of 
which is individually material. In determining such liabilities, the Group assesses the range of potential outcomes and estimates whether 
additional tax may be due.  

The Group is currently subject to audits and reviews in a number of countries that primarily relate to complex corporate tax issues. 

In March 2022, the UK tax authority indicated that it may seek to challenge aspects of an intra-group refinancing undertaken in 2013. 
The challenge relates to the deductibility of interest for UK corporation tax purposes for the period from June 2013 to December 2016 on 
certain loans which formed part of that refinancing. We have continued discussions with the tax authority and the provision, based on a range 
of possible outcomes, remains unchanged. Our maximum potential liability is £62m of tax and £17m of interest.  

The Canadian Revenue Agency’s enquiry into an intra-group financing arrangement has been resolved during the year consistent with the 
provision previously held. 

The Group does not currently anticipate any material changes to the amounts recorded at 30 September 2023.

Other source of estimation uncertainty (continued) 

  Deferred tax assets 

Deferred tax assets of £193m (2022: £230m) include £84m (2022: £95m) relating to the carry forward of unused tax losses. It is considered 
probable that sufficient taxable profits over a period of between one and five years will be available against which the unused tax losses can be 
utilised. In evaluating whether sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future, forecasts have been derived from the most recent three-
year strategic plan approved by management adjusted for the effect of applicable tax laws and regulations relevant to those future taxable profits. 
No reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would result in a significant reduction in projected taxable profits such that the 
recognised deferred tax assets would not be realised. 

Climate change 

  Climate change and the Group’s net zero commitments are not expected to have a material impact on taxable profits over the period during 

which deferred tax assets are expected to be utilised.

The income tax expense for the year is based on the effective UK statutory rate of corporation tax for the period of 22% (2022: 19%). Overseas tax 
is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

Permanent differences include the current year movement in our estimated liability for uncertain tax positions, the benefit of tax credits and the 
tax effect of non-deductible expenditure. Prior year items relate to the reassessment of prior year tax estimates and the resolution of open items. 

The global nature of the Group’s operations gives rise to various factors which could affect the future tax rate. These include the mix of profits, 
changes to overseas statutory tax rates or tax legislation and the foreign exchange rates applicable when those profits are translated into sterling. 
The UK government enacted an increase in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023. In addition, the future  
tax charge may be affected by the impact of acquisitions, disposals or other restructuring activities and the resolution of open issues with 
tax authorities.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses of £106m (2022: £323m) and other temporary differences of £21m (2022: 
£21m). Of the unrecognised tax losses, £50m (2022: £269m) will expire at various dates between 2024 and 2032. These deferred tax assets have 
not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain. 

The Group does not recognise any deferred tax liability on temporary differences relating to potentially taxable unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries totalling £598m (2022: £636m) because it is able to control the timing of reversal of these differences. It is probable that no reversal 
will take place in the foreseeable future. 

Regulatory developments 

In December 2021, the OECD released a framework for Pillar Two Model Rules which will introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% 
applicable to multinational enterprise groups with global revenue over €750m. The legislation implementing the rules in the UK will apply from the 
financial year ending 30 September 2025. The Group is reviewing this legislation and also monitoring the status of implementation of the model 
rules worldwide. The impact is not expected to be material. The Group has applied the temporary exception under IAS 12 Income Taxes in relation 
to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the Pillar Two Model Rules.

Underlying earnings per share for the year ended 30 September 2023 was 86.1p (2022: 63.0p). Underlying earnings per share is calculated 
based on earnings excluding the effect of acquisition-related charges, charges related to the strategic portfolio review, COVID-19 resizing credit, 
one-off pension charge, gains and losses on sale and closure of businesses and other financing items, together with the tax attributable to these 
amounts (see note 34).

Dividends 

Significant accounting policy 

Interim dividends are recognised in the financial statements when they are paid. Final dividends, which are subject to approval by the 
shareholders in a general meeting after the balance sheet date, are not included as a liability in the financial statements. Instead, they are 
disclosed as a post-balance sheet event and recognised in the financial statements when they are approved (see note 33). 

A final dividend in respect of 2023 of 28.1p per share, £482m in aggregate1, has been proposed, giving a total dividend in respect of 2023 of 
43.1p per share (2022: 31.5p per share). The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 8 February 2024.

Goodwill 

Significant accounting policy 

  Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 

assets and liabilities of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. 

Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the acquisition which is usually 
the geographical location of the operations of the Group. Goodwill is subsequently monitored and tested for impairment at the level at which 
it is allocated. Gains and losses on the disposal of businesses take account of the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold, 
allocated where necessary on the basis of relative fair value, unless another method is determined to be more appropriate. 

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its 
carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement which is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each 
asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised in respect of goodwill is not subsequently reversed. 

Major source of estimation uncertainty 

  The value in use of the UK CGU is estimated for the purposes of impairment testing based on assumptions, including the most recent three-
year strategic plan approved by management, long-term growth rates and discount rates. A reasonably possible change in the assumptions 
used to derive this estimate could have a material effect on the carrying amount of goodwill in the UK CGU in the next 12 months. The key 
assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations, together with sensitivity analysis, are set out below. 

Climate change 

  The potential impact of climate change and the Group’s net zero commitments on forecast cash flows beyond the Group’s three-year planning 
period has been considered during impairment testing by including in the sensitivity analysis assumptions consistent with the quantitative 
scenario analysis performed for the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (see pages 51 and 52).

Goodwill continued 

Impairment testing 

The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are operating cash flow forecasts from the most recent three-year strategic plan 
approved by management adjusted to remove the expected benefits of future restructuring activities and improvements to assets, externally-
derived long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates.  

The strategic plan is based on expectations of future outcomes taking into account past experience, adjusted for anticipated revenue growth, 
from both new business and like-for-like growth, and taking into consideration macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the impact 
of inflation.  

Cash flows beyond the three-year period covered by the plan are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic 
conditions and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the country. Cash flow forecasts for a period of up to five years are used by 
exception to reflect the medium-term prospects of the business if the initial level of headroom in the impairment test for a country is low, with cash 
flows beyond five years extrapolated using estimated growth rates that do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that country.  

The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Group’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) adjusted for specific risks relating to the country 
in which the CGU operates. The beta and gearing ratio assumptions used in the calculation of the Group’s WACC represent market participant 
measures based on the averages of a number of companies with similar assets.

1. Rest of Europe includes Türkiye which has residual growth rate and pre-tax discount rate assumptions of 16.4% (2022: 14.4%) and 31.3% (2022: 27.5%), 

respectively. Excluding Türkiye, the residual growth rate and pre-tax discount rate assumptions for Rest of Europe range from 1.2% to 2.5% (2022: 0.8% to 2.7%) 
and 10.7% to 14.6% (2022: 8.2% to 11.7%), respectively. 

During the first half of the year, a charge of £5m was recognised to fully impair the goodwill held in respect of the Group’s business in China.  

Consistent with prior years, the goodwill impairment testing was performed as at 31 July. Whilst the forecast performance of the Group’s CGUs 
has improved, the level of headroom in each CGU has been impacted by an increase in discount rates which reflect the higher market interest 
rates this year. Subsequent to 31 July, management has considered whether there have been any indicators that the goodwill may be impaired. 
There was no impact on the reported amounts of goodwill as a result of this review. 

Sensitivity analysis 

The Group has performed a sensitivity analysis based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management. 
There was no impact on the reported amounts of goodwill as a result of this review. 

The UK CGU is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. Most of the UK goodwill arose in 2000 on the Granada transaction. 
The estimated recoverable amount of the Group’s operations in the UK exceeds its carrying value by £186m (2022: £535m). The associated 
impact of changes in key assumptions on the impairment assessment is presented in the table below. The sensitivity analysis presented is 
prepared on the basis that a change in each key assumption would not have a consequential impact on other assumptions used in the 
impairment review. 

Decrease in recoverable amount  

Increase in pre-tax discount rate by 1% 
Decrease in projected operating profit by 3% 
Decrease in the long-term growth rate by 0.1%

In order for the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying value, the pre-tax discount rate would have to be increased by 0.9% (2022: 2.1%), 
projected operating profit decreased by 9% (2022: 23%) or the long-term growth rate decreased to 1.0% (2022: decline of 0.1%). The directors 
consider that changes in key assumptions of this magnitude are reasonably possible in the current environment. 

Other than as disclosed above, the directors do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the value 
in use of the net operating assets of the individually significant CGUs disclosed above to fall below their carrying values.

Other intangible assets 

Significant accounting policy 

  Acquisition intangibles 

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition and mainly relate to client 
contracts and brands. 

Client contract intangibles 
Client contract intangibles are capitalised at cost and relate to payments made to clients, typically at the start of a contract, to obtain the 
right to generate significant consumer revenue through the provision of food services at the client site. 

Computer software 
Software licences acquired for use by the Group are capitalised at cost, including the cost of purchasing the licence and the directly 
attributable cost of bringing the software application to use. 

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements are service contracts providing the Group with the right to access the cloud provider’s  
software over the contract period. As such, the Group does not receive a software intangible asset at the contract commencement date. 
Implementation services are assessed to determine whether they are distinct from the underlying use of the software. Where implementation 
services are not distinct, the cost is expensed as incurred. Where implementation services are distinct, an intangible asset is recognised if it 
satisfies the conditions for recognition as an intangible asset in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets, otherwise the cost is expensed 
as incurred. 

Trademarks and licences 
Trademarks and licences are capitalised at cost. 

Amortisation and impairment 
The method of amortisation reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the asset are expected to be consumed. The following 
methods are applied:  

–  acquisition intangibles: straight line over the life of the contract, including the renewal period where appropriate. The typical useful lives 

range from 2 to 20 years. 

–  client contract intangibles: straight line over the life of the contract. The typical useful lives range from 3 to 5 years. 
–  computer software: straight line or a method which better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the asset are expected to 

be consumed. The typical useful lives range from 3 to 10 years. 

–  trademarks and licences: straight line over the term of the trademark or licence. 

Other intangible assets are tested for impairment if there are any indicators of impairment. 

Climate change 

In the event that there are indicators of impairment in respect of long-life acquisition intangibles, the potential impact of climate change and 
the Group’s net zero commitments on forecast cash flows beyond the Group’s three-year planning period is considered during impairment 
testing by including in the sensitivity analysis assumptions consistent with the quantitative scenario analysis performed for the Task Force on 
Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (see pages 51 and 52).

Significant accounting policy 

  Contract fulfilment assets 

Costs incurred in the fulfilment of the Group’s obligations to the client under the contract include contributions towards service assets, 
such as kitchen and restaurant fit-out costs and equipment, which are capitalised as contract fulfilment assets. Contract fulfilment assets 
originate when payments are made, normally up front at the start of the client contract, that provide enhanced resources to the Group over 
the contract term. Contract fulfilment costs covered within the scope of another accounting standard, such as property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets, are not capitalised as contract fulfilment assets, but are treated according to other standards. 

Costs to obtain contracts 
Costs incurred during the bidding period, prior to a contract being awarded, are expensed to the income statement. Costs incurred in 
securing the contract after preferred bidder status has been obtained are generally expensed as incurred, unless they fulfil the conditions for 
capitalisation as an asset. 

The incremental costs to obtain a contract with a customer, such as commissions to the salesforce, are capitalised if it is expected that those 
costs will be recoverable. Only commissions directly attributable to an individual contract award are capitalised, while commissions payable 
due to multiple contract wins or due to a portfolio of client contracts are expensed as incurred as they cannot be directly attributable to an 
identified contract. Costs to obtain contracts that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained are recognised 
as an expense in the period. 

Amortisation and impairment  
Contract fulfilment assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the life of the client contract and the useful economic life 
of the assets. The amortisation charge is included in operating costs.  

Capitalised costs to obtain contracts are unwound over the life of the client contract as an expense.  

Contract fulfilment assets and capitalised costs to obtain contracts are reviewed annually to identify indicators of impairment. Whenever 
impairment indicators exist, the Group determines the recoverability of the contract fulfilment assets and capitalised costs to obtain 
contracts by comparing their carrying amount to the remaining amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive less the costs that 
relate to providing services under the relevant contract. 

The following table provides information about contract costs, assets and liabilities from contracts with customers and other contract-related balances.

The Group’s accrued and deferred income balances solely relate to revenue from contracts with customers. The timing of revenue recognition 
may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Accrued income typically arises where the timing of the related billing cycle occurs in a 
period after the performance obligation is satisfied and is recognised as a contract asset. Deferred income generally arises as a result of upfront 
payments under client contracts, including prepaid customer cards, and is recognised as contract liabilities, which are released over the term of 
the contract as revenue is recognised. Generally, such contract liabilities are recognised as revenue within 12 months. Movements during the year 
were driven by transactions entered into by the Group within the normal course of business.

No impairment losses were recognised on contract fulfilment assets during the year (2022: £3m). 

With the exception of contract fulfilment assets, cash payments in respect of contract balances are classified as cash flows from operating 
activities. There is a significant judgement in respect of the classification of cash payments relating to contract fulfilment assets in the cash flow 
statement. The Group classifies additions to contract fulfilment assets as cash flows from investing activities as they arise from cash payments in 
relation to assets that will generate long-term economic benefits. During the year, the purchase of contract fulfilment assets in cash flows from 
investing activities was £311m (2022: £218m).

12 Leases 

Significant accounting policy 

  At the inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control is conveyed where the Group has 
both the right to direct the identified asset’s use and to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from that use. The Group allocates the 
consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component. The non-lease component, where it is separately identifiable, is not 
included in the right-of-use asset. 

When a contract is or contains a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease 
commencement date with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for leases of low-value assets with an initial fair 
value less than approximately £5,000 and short-term leases of 12 months or less. For these leases, the lease payments are charged to the 
income statement as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 

The lease term is the non-cancellable period beginning at the contract commencement date plus periods covered by an option to extend the 
lease, if it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise the option, and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is 
reasonably certain that the Group will not exercise this option. 

Right-of-use assets 
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, comprising the initial lease liability adjusted for any lease payments already made, 
plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of restoration costs, less any lease incentives received.  

Depreciation and impairment 
The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. The 
estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. The right-of-use 
asset is tested for impairment if there are any indicators of impairment. 

Lease liabilities 
The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are reasonably certain and not paid at the commencement 
date, discounted at the incremental borrowing rate specific to the term, country and start date of the lease. The lease liability is subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The lease liability is remeasured, with a corresponding adjustment to the 
right-of-use asset, by discounting the revised lease payments as follows: 

–  using the initial discount rate at the commencement of the lease when lease payments change as a result of changes to residual value 

guarantees and changes in an index other than a floating interest rate 

–  using a revised discount rate when lease payments change as a result of the Group’s reassessment of whether it is reasonably certain to 

exercise a purchase, extension or termination option, changes in the lease term or as a result of a change in floating interest rates 

Variable lease payments that are not included in the measurement of the lease liability are recognised in the consolidated income statement 
in the period in which the event or condition that triggers payment occurs. 

Information regarding leases for which the Group is a lessee is provided below. The Group does not have any material arrangements where it 
acts as a lessor. 

The Group’s lease portfolio consists of office premises, concession rentals and other assets, such as catering equipment, vending machines and 
motor vehicles. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a broad range of terms and conditions. 

Some lease agreements contain variable payments that are not linked to an index or rate, but are based on the performance of the underlying 
asset. The variable payments depend on sales and, consequently, on overall economic developments over the next few years. Variable payment 
terms are used to link rental payments to cash flows and reduce fixed costs. 

The Group does not expect any significant changes in the overall ratio of the variable payments to the Group’s entire lease portfolio. 

Extension and termination options are included in a number of lease agreements and provide the Group with operational flexibility. These options 
are assessed at contract commencement as to whether they are reasonably certain to be exercised and are reassessed if a significant event or 
change in circumstances occurs which is in the control of the Group.

Property, plant and equipment 

Significant accounting policy 

  Freehold land is carried at cost and is not depreciated. All other property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. When assets are sold, the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the assets is recognised in the consolidated income statement. 

Depreciation and impairment 
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the anticipated useful lives of the assets. The following rates are applied for the Group: 
freehold buildings: 2% per annum; plant and machinery: 8% to 33% per annum; and fixtures and fittings: 8% to 33% per annum. 

Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment if there are any indicators of impairment.

Interests in joint ventures and associates 

Significant accounting policy 

  Joint arrangements are entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and which are jointly controlled by the Group and 
other entities under a contractual agreement. The Group accounts for its own share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses measured 
according to the terms of the agreements covering joint operations. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint 
control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. 

An associate is an undertaking that is not a subsidiary or joint arrangement over which the Group has significant influence and can 
participate in financial and operating policy decisions. 

Joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of 
the results of joint ventures and associates and the consolidated balance sheet includes the Group’s share of their net assets.  

Investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition and are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in value.

Other investments 

Significant accounting policy 

  Other investments comprising debt and equity instruments are recognised at fair value plus direct transaction costs. 

Debt instruments are classified at fair value through other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income, except for impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and 
losses, which are recognised in the income statement. When the debt instrument is derecognised, cumulative amounts in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement. 

Equity investments have been irrevocably designated at fair value through other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and are not subsequently reclassified to the Group income 
statement, including on derecognition. Impairment losses are not recognised separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. 

Other investments that are not equity investments, whose cash flows are not solely principal and interest or are not held in order to collect 
contractual cash flows, are classified and measured at fair value through profit and loss. Investments are included in non-current assets 
unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

3. Primarily represents a 19% effective interest in ASM Global Parent, Inc. 

The gain from the change in fair value of investments at fair value through other comprehensive income of £94m (2022: £133m loss) mainly 
reflects an increase in the market value of investments held by the Rabbi Trust and the fair value of trade investments.

Trade and other receivables 

Significant accounting policy 

  The carrying value of all trade receivables is recorded at amortised cost and reduced by provisions for impairment, which are measured at an 
amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. In determining credit risk, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that 
is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the 
Group’s historical experience and forward-looking information.

Inventories 

Significant accounting policy 

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using either the weighted average price or the first in, 
first out method as appropriate to the circumstances. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, 
less applicable variable selling expenses. 

Agreed discounts relating to inventories are credited to the income statement in cost of sales as the goods are consumed. 

Rebates relating to items purchased, but still held at the balance sheet date, are deducted from the carrying value of these items so that the 
cost of inventories is recorded net of applicable rebates.

The US Private Placement (USPP) notes contain financial covenants which consist of a leverage covenant test and an interest cover covenant test 
which are tested semi-annually at 31 March and 30 September. 

The leverage covenant test stipulates that net debt after adjustments (including removal of leases, derivatives and fair value adjustments) must be 
less than or equal to 3.5 times underlying EBITDA after adjustments (including non-underlying items, depreciation on right-of-use assets and 
lease interest) and can be increased to 4 times without breach for a limited period of time following a material acquisition and subject to a coupon 
step up being paid. 

The interest cover covenant test stipulates that underlying EBITDA after adjustments (including non-underlying items, depreciation on right-of-
use assets and lease interest) must be more than or equal to 3 times net finance costs after adjustments (including removal of lease interest and 
other financing items) and can be reduced to 2.5 times without breach for a limited period of time following a material acquisition and subject to a 
coupon step up being paid.

Financial risk management 

Significant accounting policy 

  Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 

The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps, to hedge the risks associated 
with changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the 
contract date and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates. 

The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board that provide written principles on the use of 
financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes. 

The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity 
profiles. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. 

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or net investment hedges where they hedge the exposure to 
foreign currency arising from a net investment in foreign operations. 

On adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the Group elected to continue to apply hedge accounting guidance in IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 

Fair value hedges 
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at 
fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged 
risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the consolidated income statement. Where the adjustment 
is to an unrecognised firm commitment, an asset or liability is recognised on the balance sheet. When the hedged transaction occurs, that 
asset or liability is recognised in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost and carrying amount of the asset or liability. Where the 
adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the net profit and loss 
such that it is fully amortised by maturity. 

When fair value hedge accounting is discontinued, any adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item for the designated risk for 
interest-bearing financial instruments is amortised to profit or loss, with amortisation commencing no later than when the hedged item 
ceases to be adjusted. 

Net investment hedges 
The Group uses foreign currency-denominated debt, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps to partially hedge against the 
change in the sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates. The Group 
designates these as a hedge of its net investments in foreign operations and recognises the gains or losses on the retranslation of the 
borrowings in other comprehensive income. If the Group uses derivatives as the hedging instrument, the effective portion of the hedge is 
recognised in other comprehensive income, with any ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement. Exchange 
differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a Group foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned 
nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity 
in the translation reserve. 

Gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled through the consolidated income statement on disposal of the 
foreign operation. 

For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken 
directly to the consolidated income statement in the period. 

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting.

Financial risk management continued 

The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, receivables and payables that are used to finance the Group’s operations. 
The Group also uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage interest rate 
and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations. The Group does not trade in financial instruments. The Group’s treasury policies are 
designed to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to manage the Group’s financial risks. The Board 
approves any changes to the policies.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. 

The Group finances its operations through cash generated by the business and borrowings from a number of sources, including banking 
institutions, the public and the private placement markets. The Group has developed long-term relationships with a number of financial 
counterparties with the balance sheet strength and credit quality to provide credit facilities as required.  

The Group seeks to avoid a concentration of debt maturities in any one period to spread its refinancing risk. The maturity profile of the Group’s 
principal borrowings at 30 September 2023 shows that the average period to maturity is 3.3 years (2022: 3.9 years).  

Liquidity risk faced by the Group is mitigated by having diverse sources of finance available to it and by maintaining substantial unutilised 
committed banking facilities to maintain a level of headroom in line with Board approval. 

The Group has a £2,000m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) committed to August 2026. At 30 September 2023, no amounts were drawn under the 
RCF (2022: £nil). 

The Group has a $4bn commercial paper programme. Commercial paper is issued to meet short-term liquidity requirements and is supported by 
the RCF. At 30 September 2023, no commercial paper was outstanding under the programme (2022: £nil). 

Foreign currency risk 

The Group’s policy is to balance its principal projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings in the same currency. 
As currency cash flows are generated, they are used to service and repay debt in the same currency. Where necessary, to implement this policy, 
forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps are executed which, when applied to the actual currency liabilities, convert these to the 
required currency. 

The borrowings in each currency can give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into sterling. Where the borrowings are less than, 
or equate to, the net investment in overseas operations, these exchange rate variances may be treated as movements on reserves and recorded in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income rather than in the consolidated income statement. 

Non-sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Fluctuations in exchange rates have given and will 
continue to give rise to translation differences. The Group is only partially protected from the impact of such differences through the matching of 
cash flows to currency borrowings. 

The Group has minimal exposure to the foreign currency risk of trade receivables and payables as operations within individual countries have little 
cross-border activity which might give rise to translation risks on trade-related balances. 

The main currencies to which the Group’s reported sterling financial position is exposed are the US dollar and Euro. As set out above, the Group 
seeks to hedge its exposure to currencies by matching debt in currency against the cash flows generated by the Group’s foreign operations in 
such currencies. 

The effect on profit for the year (after tax) and total equity of a 10% strengthening of sterling against these currencies on the Group’s financial 
instruments is shown below. A 10% weakening would result in an equal and opposite impact on the profit or loss and equity of the Group. This 
table shows the impact on the financial instruments in place at 30 September and has been prepared on the basis that the 10% change in 
exchange rates occurred on the first day of the financial year and applied consistently throughout the year.

As set out above, the Group has effective borrowings in a number of currencies. The Group raises fixed-rate capital market debt and may swap 
this to floating rate using interest rate swaps on a case-by-case basis. The Group’s policy is to ensure that, in the short term, it is not materially 
exposed to fluctuations in interest rates in its principal currencies. The Group implements this policy either by borrowing fixed-rate debt or by 
using interest rate swaps so that the interest rates on at least 80% of the Group’s projected debt are fixed for one year. For the second and third 
years, interest rates are fixed within ranges of 30%-70% and 0%-40%, respectively. 

In September 2022, the Group issued fixed-rate sustainable bonds of €500m (£434m) and £250m maturing in 2030 and 2032, respectively. 
The Group entered into interest rate and cross currency swaps to effectively convert these to sterling, paying a floating interest rate. The bonds 
and swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. The proceeds of the bonds have to be allocated to expenditure on Eligible Sustainable Projects 
in line with the Compass Group Sustainable Financing Framework during the three years before, and two years after, the date of issue.

Financial risk management continued 

The sensitivity analysis given below has been determined based on the derivative and non-derivative financial instruments the Group had in place 
at the year-end date. 

The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and debt subject to 
variable rates of interest at the balance sheet date would be to increase profit for the year (after tax) by £1m (2022: £7m) over the course of a 
year. A similar 1% decrease in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect over the course of a year.

These changes are the result of the exposure to interest rates from the Group’s floating-rate cash and cash equivalents and debt. The sensitivity 
gains and losses given above may vary because cash flows vary throughout the year and interest rate and currency hedging may be implemented 
after the year-end date in order to comply with the treasury policies outlined above. 

Credit risk 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. 

The Group’s policy is to minimise its exposure to credit risk from the failure of any single financial counterparty by spreading its risk across a 
portfolio of financial counterparties and managing the aggregate exposure to each against certain pre-agreed limits. Exposure to counterparty 
credit risk arising from deposits and derivatives (including forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps) is concentrated at the Group 
centre where possible. Financial counterparty limits are derived from the long-term and short-term credit ratings, and the balance sheet strength 
of the financial counterparty. All financial counterparties are required to have a minimum long-term credit rating from Moody’s of Baa2 and a 
short-term credit rating from Moody’s of P-2 or equivalent from another recognised agency. To reduce credit exposures, the Group has 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreements with all of its counterparties for financial derivatives, which permit net 
settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without 
considering netting arrangements, is equal to the carrying value of the Group’s financial assets. 

At 30 September 2023, 41% of cash and cash equivalents were held with investment-grade bank counterparties, 50% with AAA money market 
funds and 9% with non-investment-grade bank counterparties. In addition, 100% of derivative instruments were held with investment-grade 
bank counterparties. 

Credit sales are only made after credit approval procedures have been completed satisfactorily. The policy for making provisions for bad and 
doubtful debts varies from country to country as different countries and markets have different payment practices. Various factors are considered, 
including how overdue the debt is, the type of receivable and its past history, and current market and trading conditions. Full provision is made for 
debts that are not considered to be recoverable. 

There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables due to the diverse and unrelated nature of the Group’s 
client and supplier base. Expected credit losses are measured using historical cash collection data grouped according to payment terms. The 
historical default rates are adjusted where macroeconomic factors are expected to have a significant impact when determining future expected 
credit loss rates. The expected credit loss provision is calculated using a provision matrix, in which the provision increases as balances age. 

Trade and other receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery and enforcement activity has ceased. An 
impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date to measure expected credit losses. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no 
further credit provision required in excess of the provision for the impairment of receivables. The book value of trade and other receivables 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 

At 30 September 2023, trade receivables of £483m (2022: £516m) were past due but not impaired (see note 16). The Group has made a 
provision based on a number of factors, including past history of the debtor and expected credit losses, and all amounts not provided for are 
considered to be recoverable. 

Management has considered the impact of reasonable changes in the expected credit loss rates used in the estimates made and does not 
consider that a reasonable change would lead to a material adjustment to the estimate in the next 12 months.

On adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the Group elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting guidance in IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 

Fair value hedges 

The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to hedge the fair value of some of its fixed-rate borrowings. These instruments swap the 
fixed interest payable on the borrowings into floating interest rates and hedge the fair value of the borrowings against changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates. These swaps all qualify for fair value hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39.  

Net investment hedges 

The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts to partially hedge against the change 
in the sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates. 

The carrying value of debt and derivatives in a net investment hedge was £697m (2022: £909m). A foreign exchange gain of £166m (2022: 
£190m loss) relating to the net investment hedges has been netted off during the year within currency translation differences as presented in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. During the year, cumulative foreign exchange losses on net investment hedges attributable to 
business disposals of £3m (2022: £nil) were recycled to the consolidated income statement. The balance remaining in the foreign currency 
translation reserve from net investment hedging relationships for which hedge accounting continues to apply is a loss of £605m (2022: £774m) 
and for which hedge accounting is no longer applied is £nil (2022: £nil). 

Derivatives not in a hedging relationship 

The Group has a number of derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. These include some interest rate 
swaps and some forward currency contracts used for interest and cash management.

Interest rate benchmark reform 

The Group and all its derivative counterparties are party to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) fallback protocols which 
automatically convert derivatives from IBOR to the relevant alternative reference rate when an IBOR rate ceases. As USD LIBOR ceased on 
30 June 2023, there is no longer any uncertainty around derivatives which reference USD LIBOR and, therefore, the Group has adopted the 
IBOR Reform Phase 2 amendments in respect of these derivatives and redocumented its hedges to incorporate the change from USD LIBOR to 
USD SOFR. The Group’s interest rate benchmark reform process is now complete. 

Maturity analysis of the contractual cash flows of financial liabilities 

The following table provides an analysis of the expected contractual cash flows, including interest payable, of certain financial liabilities and 
derivative financial instruments on an undiscounted basis. Where interest payments are calculated at a floating rate, rates of each cash flow until 
maturity of the instruments are calculated based on the forward yield curve prevailing at the respective year-ends. The gross cash flows of 
derivatives are presented net for the purposes of this table.

Financial instruments 

Significant accounting policy 

  Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be party to such provisions. Financial assets are classified as current if they are expected 
to be received within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities are classified as current if they are legally due to be paid within 
12 months of the balance sheet date. 

Financial assets and liabilities, including derivative financial instruments, denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at 
period-end exchange rates. Financial assets are classified as either fair value through profit and loss, fair value through other comprehensive 
income or amortised cost. Classification and subsequent remeasurement depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial 
asset and its cash flow characteristics. Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely 
payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. 

Financial instruments measured at amortised cost 

The carrying amounts of the following financial instruments measured at amortised cost approximate to their fair values: trade and other 
receivables; cash and cash equivalents (excluding money market funds); lease liabilities; provisions; and trade and other payables. Borrowings 
are measured at amortised cost unless they are part of a fair value hedge, in which case amortised cost is adjusted for the fair value attributable to 
the risk being hedged. The carrying amount of borrowings at 30 September 2023 is £3,370m (2022: £3,964m). The fair value of borrowings at 
30 September 2023, calculated by discounting future cash flows to net present values at current market rates for similar financial instruments 
(Level 2 inputs), is £3,384m (2022: £3,920m). 

Financial instruments measured at fair value 

The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the balance sheet date.  

The fair value measurement hierarchy is as follows: 

–  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
–  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 

indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)

Financial instruments continued 

Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at 30 September 2023 may not be indicative of the amounts the Group 
would expect to realise in the current market environment. The fair values of financial instruments at levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy have 
been determined based on the valuation methodologies listed below: 

Level 2 

Life insurance policies Cash surrender values provided by third-party insurance providers. 

Derivative financial instruments Present values determined from future cash flows discounted at rates derived from market-sourced data. 
The fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the maximum credit exposure.  

Level 3 

Trade investments Estimated values using income and market value approaches.  

Contingent consideration payable on business acquisitions Estimated amounts payable based on the likelihood of specified conditions, such as 
earnings targets, being met. 

Non-controlling interest put options Estimated amounts payable based on the likelihood of options being exercised by minority shareholders. 

A reconciliation from opening to closing balances for Level 3 financial instruments is as follows:

Trade and other payables  

Significant accounting policy 

  Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value, including transaction costs, and subsequently carried at amortised cost.  

Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 

The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the liability has the characteristics of a trade payable 
or should be classified as borrowings. This assessment considers the commercial purpose of the arrangement, whether the payment terms 
are similar to customary payment terms, whether the Group is legally discharged from its obligation towards the supplier before the end of 
the original payment term and the Group’s involvement in agreeing terms between the bank and the supplier. 

Contingent consideration recognised in a business combination is subsequently measured at fair value through the income statement.

The Group has Supply Chain Financing (SCF) arrangements in place. The principal purpose of these arrangements is to enable the supplier, if it so 
wishes, to sell its receivables due from the Group to a third-party bank prior to their due date, thus providing earlier access to liquidity. From the 
Group’s perspective, the invoice payment due date remains unaltered and the payment terms of suppliers participating in the SCF programmes 
are similar to those suppliers that are not participating, and to the wider industry more generally.  

If a receivable is purchased by a third-party bank, that third-party bank does not benefit from additional security when compared to the security 
originally enjoyed by the supplier. 

At 30 September 2023, the value of invoices sold under the SCF programmes was £789m, with £735m related to the Group’s programme in the 
US (2022: £772m and £706m, respectively). These amounts are included in trade payables and all cash flows associated with the programmes 
are included in net cash flow from operating activities as they continue to be part of the normal operating cycle of the Group.

Provisions 

Significant accounting policy 

  Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best 
estimate of the cost of settling these liabilities and are discounted to present value where the effect is material using the discount rate 
applicable to the liability.

In estimating the provisions above, management has made estimates and used assumptions in determining the nature, amount and timing of 
potential outflows. Management does not consider that a reasonable change in key assumptions in any of the provision estimates made at the 
date of the balance sheet could lead to a material adjustment in the next 12 months to the carrying amount of the liability recorded. 

Workers’ compensation and similar obligations The provision for workers’ compensation and similar obligations relates mainly to the potential 
settlement of claims by employees in the US for medical benefits and lost wages associated with injuries incurred in the course of their 
employment, and is essentially long term in nature. 

Severance Provisions for severance primarily represent redundancy costs. The Group expects these provisions to be substantially utilised within 
the next year. 

Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are 
lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. Provisions for onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect 
of unavoidable contract losses which will be utilised over the remaining life of each individual contract. The typical length of a client contract is 
three to five years. A full analysis is performed at least annually of the future profitability of all loss-making contracts and contracts with low 
profitability, and of the balance sheet items directly linked to these contracts.  

Legal and other claims Provisions for legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and other sundry 
claims. The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain. 

Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed businesses Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed businesses relate to 
estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals. The final amount payable remains uncertain 
as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, negotiations in relation to potential claims are ongoing and there remains a further period 
during which claims may be received. The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claims received. 

Other Other provisions include environmental provisions in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Group’s responsibility for maintaining its 
operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements. The Group’s aim is to have a low impact on the environment. These provisions are 
expected to be utilised as operating sites are closed or as environmental matters are resolved.

Post-employment benefits 

Significant accounting policy 

  Pension obligations 

The Group operates two types of pension plans: 

–  defined contribution plans where the Group makes contributions to a member’s pension plan, but has no further payment obligations 

once the contributions have been paid 

–  defined benefit plans which provide pension payments upon retirement to members as defined by the plan rules 

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to separately administered pension plans. The contributions payable by the 
Group are charged to the consolidated income statement when they are due. Payments made to state-managed schemes are treated as 
payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined 
contribution pension plan. 

For defined benefit plans, the calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed half-yearly by a qualified actuary using the projected 
unit credit method. A current service cost is recognised which represents the expected present value of the defined benefit pension 
entitlement earned by members in the period. The consolidated balance sheet reflects a net asset or net liability for each defined benefit 
pension plan. The net asset or liability recognised is the present value of the defined benefit obligation discounted using the yields on high-
quality corporate bonds, less the fair value of plan assets (at bid price), if any. If the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the defined benefit 
obligation, a pension surplus is only recognised if the Group considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund. 

For the UK defined benefit plan, the Group considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund of a surplus, assuming the gradual 
settlement of the plan liabilities over time until all members have left the plan. The trustees cannot unconditionally wind up the plan or use 
the surplus to enhance member benefits without employer consent. The Group’s judgement is that these trustee rights do not prevent the 
Group from recognising an unconditional right to a refund and therefore a surplus. 

Net interest income (if a plan is in surplus) or net interest expense (if a plan is in deficit) is calculated using yields on high-quality corporate 
bonds and recognised in the consolidated income statement.  

Remeasurements, which include gains and losses as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions, the effect of the limit on the plan surplus 
(if any) and returns on plan assets (other than amounts included in net interest) are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. 

Other post-employment obligations 
Some Group companies provide other post-employment benefits. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of 
employment using a similar basis to that used for defined benefit pension schemes. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 

The non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the US (Rabbi Trust) does not meet the definition of a defined contribution plan under 
IAS 19 and is, therefore, accounted for as a defined benefit plan. 

Major source of estimation uncertainty 

  The present value of defined benefit liabilities is estimated based on actuarial assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, 
including discount rates, inflation, pension and salary increases, and mortality and other demographic assumptions. A reasonably possible 
change in the assumptions used to derive these estimates could have a material effect on the present value of defined benefit liabilities in the 
next 12 months. The key assumptions used to value the liabilities, together with sensitivity analysis, are set out below. 

Climate change 

  Plan assets 

The trustees of the Compass Group Pension Plan (UK Plan), the Group’s largest defined benefit plan, have integrated climate change 
considerations into their long-term decision-making and reporting processes across all classes of assets, actively engaging with all fund and 
portfolio managers. 

Defined benefit obligations 
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the present value of defined benefit obligations comprise financial and demographic 
assumptions. The key financial assumptions are discount rates and inflation and, as these reflect long-term market expectations, they 
implicitly reflect the market’s expectations of the potential impact of climate change. The directors have considered the potential impact of 
climate change on demographic assumptions, in particular on the long-term mortality assumptions and, at the present time, do not believe 
that there is sufficient evidence to require a change in the assumptions used in the calculation of the defined benefit liabilities. The directors 
will continue to monitor any potential future impact on the assumptions used.

Pension schemes  

The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory 
requirements and local customs and practices. The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes’ assets are held independently of 
the Group’s assets. Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries. 

UK schemes 

Current UK employees in a pension arrangement are in the Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan (CRISP), a GAD section of the UK Plan or 
the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). 

CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003 and has been the main vehicle for pension provision for eligible new joiners in the UK since that date. 
CRISP is a defined contribution (money purchase) arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay (minimum 
5%). Within CRISP, a new defined contribution section was established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan (CHIP). Senior 
employees who contribute to CRISP are offered an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP. The amount of contribution and eligibility for 
CHIP are decided annually at the Group’s discretion. A CHIP payment may be taken in part, or in whole, as a cash allowance instead of a pension 
contribution. 

CRISP has a corporate trustee, CRISP Trustees Limited. The Chairman is a former employee of the Group and the other six trustee directors are 
UK-based employees of the Group, three of whom are nominated by CRISP members.  

The UK Plan is a defined benefit arrangement, which provides predominantly final salary benefits. Those UK employees who transferred from the 
public sector under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, typically up until 31 March 2015, have been 
eligible to join the UK Plan, which has otherwise been closed to new entrants since 2003. Such transferees entered into the GAD sections of the 
UK Plan and are known as ‘GAD members’. However, under the UK government’s revised guidance for ‘Fair Deal for staff pensions’, the 
expectation is, and the approach has been, that the Group participates in the relevant public sector pension scheme and closes the UK Plan to 
future entrants. The UK Plan closed to future accrual for all existing members, other than GAD members, on 5 April 2010. The affected members 
were offered membership of CRISP from 6 April 2010. 

The UK Plan operates on a funded basis. The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 
100% funding level on a projected salary basis. The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent 
qualified actuaries. A formal actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years. The most recent valuation of the UK Plan took 
place as at 5 April 2022. At the valuation date, the total market value of the assets of the UK Plan was £2,617m which represented 113% of the 
benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. A revised schedule of contributions was agreed by 
the UK Plan’s trustee and the Company and, with effect from 1 October 2022, the Company pays contributions to the UK Plan at a rate of 47.1% 
of pensionable pay (previously 57.2%). 

The UK Plan is reappraised half-yearly for accounting purposes by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits 
requirements. 

The UK Plan has a corporate trustee. There is an independent chairman and one other independent trustee director. There are a further five 
trustee directors who are either UK-based employees or former employees of the Group (three of whom have been nominated by UK Plan 
members). The UK Plan operates under the Fifth Definitive Trust Deed dated 25 March 2013 and subsequent amendments and relevant 
legislation (principally the Pensions Acts 1993, 1995, 2004 and 2021), with regulatory oversight from the Pensions Regulator. The Group has 
proposed a bulk transfer of CRISP into the UK Plan and for CRISP to operate as a separate defined contribution section of the UK Plan from 
1 January 2024. Following the transfer, the combined board of the UK Plan will include trustee directors from both arrangements. Agreement with 
the trustees is expected before the end of the calendar year following a period of consultation with CRISP members and potential CRISP members 
which ended on 8 November 2023. 

The Group is subject to the Pension Automatic Enrolment Regulations for its workforce in the UK. All new UK employees who meet the statutory 
eligibility criteria, and who do not join CRISP or the UK Plan, are automatically enrolled into the NEST. Responsibility for the Group’s ongoing 
compliance with the Pension Automatic Enrolment Regulations and for ensuring that the administration and investment of funds relating to 
automatic enrolment remain appropriate lies with the Group’s Pension Automatic Enrolment Governance Committee. 

US schemes 

In the US, the main vehicles for retirement provision are defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plans are closed to new participants. 
Compass USA has taken out life insurance policies and invested in mutual funds to meet these unfunded defined benefit pension obligations, 
working towards a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis. 

The Group also has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (Rabbi Trust), which is a salary sacrifice scheme providing a tax-efficient savings 
plan for senior management. Employee and employer contributions to the plan are invested on behalf of the employees in investment funds and 
they are entitled to the assets and their returns on or after leaving the Group. Plan benefits are paid in cash. Participants can elect to receive 
payment either as a lump sum or in annual instalments over 5 to 15 years. 

Compass USA engages with a number of unions and is required to abide by the individual collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) negotiated 
with each union. Under the terms of these CBAs, Compass USA is required to pay the union members’ salary and contribute to various multi-
employer benefit plans which include: post-employment benefits, including pensions and post-employment healthcare; defined contribution 
plans, such as 401(k) and annuity and savings plans; and other plans which include legal funds, training funds and education funds.

Post-employment benefits continued 

Participation in multi-employer pension plans bears risks that differ from single-employer plans. These risks include: 

–  assets contributed to the plans by Compass USA may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers 
–  if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan for any reason, the unfunded obligation remaining may transition to the remaining 

employers participating in the plan 

–  if Compass USA stops participating in the plan for any reason, it may be required to pay a proportionate amount to the plan for its share of the 

unfunded liability, known as a withdrawal liability 

Compass USA is involved with 38 multi-employer benefit plans (2022: 39). The Group is not aware of, and has no reasonable expectation that, 
any plan in which it currently participates is in imminent danger of becoming insolvent or is likely to experience a mass withdrawal. 

These plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans as the information provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for them to be 
accounted for as defined benefit plans. The Group made total contributions of £44m in the year (2022: £30m) to these arrangements. 

Other schemes 

In Canada, Germany, Norway, Spain and Switzerland, the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements. 

In other countries, Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions. 

Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants. For these schemes, the current 
service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement. 

Defined benefit schemes 

The Group’s obligations in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of 
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years. That benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value and the fair value of scheme assets is then deducted. The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high-quality 
corporate bonds, with terms consistent with the timing of the expected benefit payments over future years. 

The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions which include inflation, expected salary 
and pension increases, and life expectancy of members. It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions used may 
have a significant effect on the consolidated income statement and balance sheet. 

The split of defined benefit liabilities on an IAS 19 basis between active, deferred and pensioner members is shown below:

The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the S3PA generational mortality tables (2022: S3PA 
generational mortality tables) with improvements in line with the projection model prepared by the 2022 Continuous Mortality Investigation of the 
UK actuarial profession (2022: 2021 model), with an S-kappa of 7.0 (2022: 7.5), with 115% (2022: 119%) weighting for male non-pensioners and 
109% (2022: 113%) for male pensioners and 103% (2022: 106%) weighting for female non-pensioners and 99% (2022: 102%) weighting for 
female pensioners, with a long-term underpin of 1.5% per annum (2022: 1.5% per annum). These mortality assumptions take account of 
experience to date and assumptions for further improvements in the life expectancy of scheme members. The Group estimates the average 
duration of the liabilities of the UK and US plans to be 12 years (2022: 13 years) and 8 years (2022: 7 years), respectively. Examples of the 
resulting life expectancies for the UK Plan are as follows:

The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data. 
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of pension schemes. 

For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries. The mortality 
assumptions used to value the US schemes are derived from the mortality table Pri-2012 (2022: Pri-2012) and MP2021 generational scale 
(2022: MP2021). Examples of the resulting life expectancies for the US schemes are as follows:

The Group bears a number of risks in relation to its defined benefit pension schemes. These risks and how they are mitigated for the Group’s 
largest defined benefit plan are described below: 

Risk 

Interest rate 

Inflation 

Description of risk 

Mitigation 

A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the 
schemes’ benefit obligations under IAS 19. The 
schemes are therefore exposed to the risk that falls 
in interest rates will decrease the schemes’ surplus. 

The schemes’ benefit obligations are linked to 
inflation. A higher rate of expected long-term 
inflation will therefore lead to higher liabilities, both 
for the IAS 19 and funding liability. 

Investment 

Asset returns can be volatile and there is a risk that 
the value of pension schemes’ assets may not move 
in line with changes in pension scheme liabilities. 

Life expectancy 

The schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for 
the life of the member and therefore increases in life 
expectancy will lead to higher liabilities. 

As part of the investment strategy, the UK Plan aims to 
mitigate this risk through investment in a liability-driven 
investment (LDI) portfolio. LDI is a form of investing designed 
to match to a large extent the movement in pension plan 
assets with the movement in projected benefit obligations 
over time. 

The UK Plan contains caps on increases in scheme benefits 
to mitigate the risk of increases in inflation. Additionally, the 
UK Plan invests in LDI products which increase (decrease) in 
value when expectations of future inflation rates increase 
(fall), thus providing protection against inflation risk. 

To mitigate against investment risk, the UK Plan invests in a 
way which aims to hedge a large proportion of the movements 
in the corresponding liabilities and investments are diversified 
across and within asset classes to avoid overexposure to any 
one asset class or market. The trustees and the Group 
regularly monitor the funding position and operate a 
diversified investment strategy. 

The UK Plan’s trustees and the Group regularly monitor the 
impact of changes in longevity on scheme obligations. 

Sensitivity analysis 

Measurement of the Group’s defined benefit obligations is particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions, including the discount rate, inflation 
and life expectancy. The sensitivities of the principal assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligations of the schemes are set out below:

Management has also considered the impact of a 1% change in the discount rate and inflation assumptions used to measure the defined benefit 
obligations of the UK schemes. A 1% increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase the liabilities by £148m and £180m, 
respectively. A 1% increase or decrease in inflation would increase or decrease the liabilities by £85m and £81m, respectively. 

The sensitivities above consider the impact of the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged. The sensitivity 
analyses have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined benefit obligations as a result of reasonable 
changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by 
offsetting changes in another assumption (although this is not always the case). The impact of a change in the UK inflation rate shown above 
includes the impact of a change in both the RPI and CPI inflation rates. 

The Group’s net pension surplus or deficit is the difference between the schemes’ assets and liabilities. Changes in the assumptions may occur at 
the same time as changes in the market value of scheme assets. These may or may not offset the changes in assumptions. For example, a fall in 
interest rates will increase the schemes’ liabilities, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value of certain assets so there may be 
little effect on the Group’s net asset or liability. 

Plan assets 

At 30 September 2023, the assets of the various schemes were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of debt securities and 
property funds. The UK Plan’s corporate bonds are held in a unit-linked insurance policy managed by M&G. The UK Plan’s unquoted property 
fund assets comprise a UK property fund of £155m (2022: £187m) and a global property fund of £131m (2022: £154m). The UK property  
fund’s value is based on the net asset value at 30 September 2023. The global property fund’s value is based on a US dollar net asset value at 
30 June 2023 converted at the exchange rate at 30 September 2023. There has been no material change in the fair value of the global property 
fund between 30 June and 30 September 2023. The majority of the remainder of the UK Plan’s assets are held in a bespoke liability-driven 
investment portfolio in a unit-linked insurance policy managed by Legal & General.

The UK Plan holds corporate bonds and other fixed-interest securities. The risk of default on these is assessed by various rating agencies. Some of 
these bond investments are issued by the UK government. The risk of default on these is lower compared to the risk on corporate bond 
investments, although some risk may remain. The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their 
market value.

1. 2023 includes a £5m charge following a change in legislation in Türkiye eliminating the minimum retirement age requirement for certain employees effective from 

March 2023. 

2. The expenses of running the UK Plan are met directly by the UK Plan rather than by the principal employer. 

The £38m reduction in the present value of defined benefit obligations due to changes in financial assumptions in 2023 includes the impact on 
the liabilities of the UK Plan of a 0.6 percentage point increase in the discount rate, net of inflation.  

The negative return on plan assets of £271m mainly reflects the performance of the UK Plan as gilt yields have increased, reducing the value of 
government bonds, and property values have decreased. 

The present value of defined benefit obligations includes £623m (2022: £566m) in respect of the Rabbi Trust, which is exactly matched by its 
investments (see note 15). 

Certain Group companies have taken out life insurance policies and invested in mutual funds to meet unfunded pension obligations. The current 
value of these policies and other assets of £77m (2022: £85m) may not be offset against post-employment benefit obligations under IAS 19 
(see note 15). 

Net post-employment benefit assets, including the Rabbi Trust investments, life insurance policies and mutual fund investments, is shown below:

The Group made total contributions to defined benefit schemes of £43m (including the Rabbi Trust) in the year (2022: £31m). Contributions in 
2023 include £8m following a change in legislation in Türkiye effective from March 2023. The Group expects to make a similar level of 
contributions to these schemes in 2024 including the impact of the legislation change in Türkiye. 

The UK Plan is the largest scheme in the Group and was in surplus on a funding basis at the date of the most recent actuarial valuation as at 
5 April 2022 and no deficit contributions are currently required. The remaining Group-funded schemes do not have significant minimum funding 
requirements whilst contributions to unfunded pension schemes are quite stable. As a result, we do not expect the required future contributions 
to change substantially beyond next year.

Significant accounting policy 

  Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 

Capital 

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (see note 34) and total equity. Our capital allocation framework is clear and unchanged. 
Our priority is to invest in the business to fund growth opportunities, target a strong investment-grade credit rating with a leverage target of around 
1x-1.5x net debt to EBITDA and pay an ordinary dividend, with any surplus capital being returned to shareholders. At 30 September 2023, the 
ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was 1.2x (2022: 1.3x) (see note 34).

The nominal value of shares in the Company purchased and subsequently cancelled is shown as a reduction in share capital and an equal and 
opposite transfer to the capital redemption reserve. 

Own shares reserve 

The own shares reserve represents shares in Compass Group PLC held either in treasury, including transaction costs, or by employee share trusts 
to satisfy liabilities to employees for long-term incentive plans. Own shares are treated as a deduction to equity until the shares are cancelled, 
reissued or sold, at which point they are transferred to retained earnings. 

The own shares reserve comprises £1,501m (2022: £515m) in respect of 70,170,859 (2022: 25,202,499) shares in Compass Group PLC held in 
treasury and £12m (2022: £4m) in respect of 573,223 (2022: 221,909) shares in Compass Group PLC held by the Compass Group PLC All Share 
Schemes Trust (ASST). 

The share buyback announced in November 2022 was completed in March 2023, with 13,127,521 shares repurchased during the year for a total 
price, including transaction costs, of £251m. Transaction costs of £1m were incurred in respect of the 3,447,549 shares repurchased during the 
year in respect of the completion of the share buyback announced in May 2022. 

In May 2023, the Company announced that it was commencing a further share buyback to repurchase up to £750m of its own shares. During the 
year, 29,736,882 shares were repurchased for a total price, including transaction costs, of £621m, of which £600m was paid in cash during the 
year. The mandate issued to the broker to purchase the shares was irrevocable at 30 September 2023 and, therefore, a creditor of £131m in 
respect of the value of the shares not yet purchased has been recognised. The share buyback was completed in November and, in total, 
36,094,092 shares were repurchased under the programme for a total price, including transaction costs, of £752m. 

The ASST is a discretionary trust for the benefit of employees and the shares held are used to satisfy some of the Group’s liabilities to employees for 
long-term incentive plans. During the year, 800,000 (2022: 317,052) shares in Compass Group PLC were purchased by the ASST and 448,686 
(2022: 280,371) shares were released from the ASST to satisfy awards under the Company’s long-term incentive plans. At 30 September 2023, 
the nominal value of the shares in the ASST was £63,341 (2022: £24,521), with a market value of £11m (2022: £4m). 

No shares have been released from treasury or by the ASST since the end of the financial year to the date of this Report to satisfy awards under 
the Company’s long-term incentive plans. 

Merger reserve 

The merger reserve arose in 2000 as a result of the merger between Compass and Granada. 

Revaluation reserve 

The revaluation reserve arose on the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in GR SA during 2008. The portion of the fair value adjustment 
pertaining to the Group’s existing 50% shareholding in GR SA was credited to the revaluation reserve in accordance with IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations. 

Translation reserve 

The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. 

Non-controlling interest put options reserve 

Where put options are held in respect of a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and the minority shareholders hold present access to the returns 
of the entity, the Group recognises a non-controlling interest, together with a put option liability measured at fair value and a corresponding  
non-controlling interest put options reserve. Subsequent remeasurements of put option liabilities under the present access and anticipated 
acquisition methods are recognised in the non-controlling interest put options reserve.

Share-based payments 

Significant accounting policy 

  The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees which are measured at fair value at the date of grant using 

option pricing models. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of the number 
of shares expected to vest. 

Income statement expense 

The Group recognised a charge of £44m (2022: £34m) in respect of share-based payment transactions. All share-based payment plans are 
equity-settled. The charge is broken down by share-based payment plan as follows:

The vesting conditions of the LTIP awards are included in the Directors’ remuneration report. The fair value of awards subject to Adjusted Free 
Cash Flow (AFCF) and Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) performance targets is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The 
vesting probability of these non-market conditions has been assessed based on a simulation model of the AFCF and ROCE forecasts. The fair 
value of awards subject to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance targets is calculated using the Monte Carlo model. 

The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of LTIP awards made during the year:

Eligible awards granted under the 2018 LTIP accrue dividends in the form of Notional Dividend Shares. Accordingly, the dividend yield in the fair 
value calculation is nil. 

The weighted average share price at the date of vesting for the 1,113,799 shares (2022: 29,082) that vested during the year was 1,824.00p 
(2022: 1,455.00p). 

The LTIP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.2 years (2022: 1.4 years). 

Restricted shares 

These are awards to certain employees in order to incentivise the achievement of particular business objectives under specific circumstances or 
where similar such shares have been forfeited by a new employee on joining the Group. The plan can take different forms such as an award of 
shares dependent on service or achievement of specific performance conditions other than service.

Acquisition, sale and closure of businesses 

Significant accounting policy 

  Business acquisitions 

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued. 

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognised at the fair values at the acquisition date, except 
for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs 
to sell. 

The cost of the acquisition in excess of the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the 
consolidated income statement. 

Where not all the equity of a subsidiary is acquired, the non-controlling interest is recognised at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate 
share of the net assets of the subsidiary. Put options over non-controlling interests are recognised as a financial liability measured at fair 
value which is re-evaluated at each year-end with a corresponding entry in the non-controlling interest put options reserve. 

Business disposals 
The Group ceases to consolidate a subsidiary when it has lost control. Upon losing control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement which includes any cumulative currency translation differences previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income. Any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in 
profit or loss. 

Assets held for sale 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to a 
sale plan, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the 
date of classification.  

Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill is allocated to the held for sale 
business on a relative fair value basis where this business forms part of a larger CGU. Investments in joint ventures and associates that have 
been classified as held for sale are no longer accounted for using the equity method. 

If the non-current asset or disposal group that ceases to be classified as held for sale is a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, prior year 
comparatives are restated for the periods since classification as held for sale and accounted for retrospectively. 

Acquisition of businesses 

The total cash spent on the acquisition of subsidiaries during the year, net of cash acquired, was £336m (2022: £273m), including £41m of 
deferred and contingent consideration and other payments relating to businesses acquired in previous years and £17m of acquisition transaction 
costs included in net cash flow from operating activities.  

On 20 March 2023, the Group acquired the trade and assets of Parks Coffee, a provider of workplace refreshments in the US, for an initial 
consideration of $108m (£90m). Total consideration includes $6m (£5m) payable in 2024 and an estimated $23m (£20m) payable in 2025 
contingent on the operation of an earn-out. The goodwill in relation to the assets acquired is £43m. This goodwill represents the premium the 
Group paid to acquire the business that complements its existing businesses and creates significant opportunities and other synergies.

Acquisition, sale and closure of businesses continued 

Contingent consideration is an estimate at the date of acquisition of the amount of additional consideration that will be payable in the future. 
The actual amount paid can vary from the estimate depending on the terms of the transaction and, for example, the actual performance of the 
acquired business. 

The fair value adjustments made in respect of acquisitions in the year to 30 September 2023 are provisional and will be finalised within 12 months 
of the acquisition date, principally in relation to the valuation of contracts acquired. 

The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the businesses represents the premium the Group has paid to acquire companies which complement 
its existing businesses and create significant opportunities for cross-selling and other synergies. The goodwill arising is not expected to be 
deductible for tax purposes. 

The acquisitions did not have a material impact on the Group’s revenue or profit for the year. 

Sale and closure of businesses 

The Group has recognised a net gain of £20m on the sale and closure of businesses (2022: net loss of £7m), including exit costs of £11m 
(2022: £7m). Activity in the year includes the exit from seven tail countries, together with the sale of businesses in the US and UK, and a further 
28% shareholding in Highways Royal Co., Limited (Japanese Highways).

Contingent liabilities 

Significant accounting policy 

  Provisions for legal and other claims are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where it is possible that a 
settlement will be reached or it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation, no provision is recognised, but 
appropriate disclosure as a contingent liability is made. 

Performance bonds, guarantees and indemnities 

Performance bonds, guarantees and indemnities 
Performance bonds, guarantees and indemnities (including those of associated undertakings)1 

2023  
£m

2022

1. Excludes post-employment obligations, borrowings and lease liabilities. 

The Company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counter indemnities 
in respect of such guarantees relating to the Group’s own contracts and/or the Group’s share of certain contractual obligations of joint 
arrangements and associates. Where the Group enters into such arrangements, it does so in order to provide assurance to the beneficiary, 
typically the client, that it will fulfil its contractual obligations, rather than to provide an insurance contract to compensate the client in the event 
that it does not fulfil those contractual obligations. The issue of such guarantees and indemnities does not increase the Group’s overall exposure 
and the disclosure of such performance bonds, guarantees and indemnities is given for information purposes only. 

Litigation and claims 

The Group is involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the nature of its business and maintains insurance cover to reduce financial risk 
associated with claims related to these proceedings. Where appropriate, provisions are made to cover any potential uninsured losses. 

Although it is not possible to predict the outcome or quantify the financial effect of these proceedings, or any claim against the Group related 
thereto, in the opinion of the directors, any uninsured losses resulting from the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect 
on the financial position of the Group. The timing of the settlement of these proceedings or claims is uncertain. 

The Group is currently subject to audits and reviews in a number of countries that primarily relate to complex corporate tax issues. None of these 
audits is currently expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial position. 

We continue to engage with tax authorities and other regulatory bodies on payroll and sales tax reviews, and compliance with labour laws and 
regulations. 

The federal tax authorities in Brazil have issued notices of deficiency in respect of 2014 and 2017 relating primarily to the PIS/COFINS treatment 
of certain food costs which we have formally objected to and which are now proceeding through the appeals process. At 30 September 2023, the 
total amount assessed in respect of these matters is £72m, including interest and penalties. The possibility of further notices of deficiency for 
subsequent years cannot be ruled out and the judicial process is likely to take a number of years to conclude. Based on the opinion of our local 
legal advisers, we do not currently consider it likely that we will have to settle a liability with respect to these matters and, on this basis, no 
provision has been recorded.  

In addition, there are a number of other ongoing tax cases in Brazil. None of these cases is individually significant and, therefore, we do not 
currently expect any of these issues to have a material impact on the Group’s financial position. 

Food safety 

In the ordinary course of business, food safety incidents are identified from time to time and our businesses’ operations receive external reviews of 
their food hygiene and safety practices, both on a periodic basis and in connection with identified incidents. At any point, a number of reviews will 
be ongoing. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome or quantify the financial effect of the outcome of these reviews, or any claim against 
Group companies related thereto, in the opinion of the directors, any uninsured losses resulting from the ultimate resolution of these ongoing 
reviews are not expected to have a material effect on the financial position of the Group. The timing of the outcome of these reviews is generally 
uncertain.

financial year.

under the share buyback announced in May 2023. In November 2023, we announced a further share buyback of up to $500m (£410m), to 
complete in 2024 subject to M&A activity.  

On 20 November 2023, a final dividend in respect of 2023 of 28.1p per share, £482m in aggregate, was proposed.

Non-GAAP measures 

Introduction 

The Executive Committee manages and assesses the performance of the Group using various underlying and other Alternative Performance 
Measures (APMs). These measures are not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or other generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP) and may not be directly comparable with APMs used by other companies. Underlying measures reflect ongoing trading and, 
therefore, facilitate meaningful year-on-year comparison. The Group’s APMs, together with the results prepared in accordance with IFRS, provide 
comprehensive analysis of the Group’s results. Accordingly, the relevant statutory measures are also presented where appropriate. Certain of the 
Group’s APMs are financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which measure progress against our strategy. 

In determining the adjustments to arrive at underlying results, we use a set of established principles relating to the nature and materiality of 
individual items or groups of items, including, for example, events which: (i) are outside the normal course of business; (ii) are incurred in a 
pattern that is unrelated to the trends in the underlying financial performance of our ongoing business; or (iii) are related to business acquisitions 
or disposals as they are not part of the Group’s ongoing trading business and the associated cost impact arises from the transaction rather than 
from the continuing business.

1. The non-distributable portion of retained earnings is £340m at 30 September 2023 (2022: £301m). 
2. Including stamp duty and brokers’ commission. 
3. In 2022, the share-based payments reserve was transferred to retained earnings on the basis that it is more appropriately presented as a component of retained 
earnings and the value of shares in Compass Group PLC purchased in previous years and held in treasury at 30 September 2022 was transferred from retained 
earnings to the own shares reserve. 

4. Details of dividends paid to equity shareholders are shown in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 

The accompanying notes form part of these Parent Company financial statements. 

Capital redemption reserve 

The nominal value of shares in the Company purchased and subsequently cancelled is shown as a reduction in share capital and an equal and 
opposite transfer to the capital redemption reserve. 

Own shares reserve 

The own shares reserve represents shares in Compass Group PLC held either in treasury, including transaction costs, or by employee share trusts 
to satisfy liabilities to employees for long-term incentive plans. Own shares are treated as a deduction to equity until the shares are cancelled, 
reissued or sold, at which point they are transferred to retained earnings. 

The own shares reserve comprises £1,501m in respect of 70,170,859 shares in Compass Group PLC held in treasury and £12m in respect of 
573,223 shares in Compass Group PLC held by the Compass Group PLC All Share Schemes Trust (ASST). 

The share buyback announced in November 2022 was completed in March 2023, with 13,127,521 shares repurchased during the year for a total 
price, including transaction costs, of £251m. Transaction costs of £1m were incurred in respect of the 3,447,549 shares repurchased during the 
year in respect of the completion of the share buyback announced in May 2022. 

In May 2023, the Company announced that it was commencing a further share buyback to repurchase up to £750m of its own shares. During the 
year, 29,736,882 shares were repurchased for a total price, including transaction costs, of £621m, of which £600m was paid in cash during the 
year. The mandate issued to the broker to purchase the shares was irrevocable at 30 September 2023 and, therefore, a creditor of £131m in 
respect of the value of the shares not yet purchased has been recognised. The share buyback was completed in November and, in total, 
36,094,092 shares were repurchased under the programme for a total price, including transaction costs, of £752m. 

The ASST is a discretionary trust for the benefit of employees and the shares held are used to satisfy some of the Group’s liabilities to employees 
for long-term incentive plans. During the year, 800,000 shares in Compass Group PLC were purchased by the ASST and 448,686 shares were 
released from the ASST to satisfy awards under the Company’s long-term incentive plans. At 30 September 2023, the nominal value of the shares 
in the ASST was £63,341, with a market value of £11m. 

No shares have been released from treasury or by the ASST since the end of the financial year to the date of this Report to satisfy awards under 
the Company’s long-term incentive plans.

Significant accounting policies 

The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
separate financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise 
stated. 

Changes in accounting policies 

There have been no significant changes in accounting policies during 
the year. 

Investments in subsidiary undertakings 

Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment. In 
the opinion of the directors, the value of such investments is not less 
than shown at the balance sheet date. 

Investment income is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable. It represents dividend income which is 
recognised when the right to receive payment is established. 

Foreign currency 

Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the rates of exchange ruling at the year-end. Gains and losses 
arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for 
the period. 

Financial assets and liabilities 

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s 
balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be 
party to such provisions. Financial assets are classified as current if 
they are expected to be received within 12 months of the balance 
sheet date. Financial liabilities are classified as current if they are 
legally due to be paid within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

Financial assets and liabilities are initially recorded at fair value 
including, where permitted by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, any 
directly attributable transaction costs. For those financial assets that 
are not subsequently held at fair value, the carrying amounts are 
reduced by a provision equal to the lifetime expected credit losses 
using historic and forward-looking data on credit risk. 

The Company classifies its financial assets and liabilities into the 
following categories: 

–  financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost 
–  financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 

Where financial assets or liabilities are eligible to be carried at either 
amortised cost or fair value, the Company does not apply the fair value 
option. 

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its 
exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. 
Derivative instruments utilised include interest rate swaps, currency 
swaps and forward currency contracts. The Company and Group 
policy is disclosed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment. In 

the opinion of the directors, the value of such investments is not less 

than shown at the balance sheet date. 

The separate financial statements of Compass Group PLC (the

In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the 

recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-

adopted International Accounting Standards, but makes amendments 

where necessary to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set 

out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has 

been taken. 

The financial statements present information about the Company as 

an individual undertaking, not as a Group undertaking, and are 

included in the Compass Group PLC consolidated financial 

statements for the year ended 30 September 2023. As permitted by 

section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not 

presented its own income statement. The amount of profit for the year 

of the Company is disclosed in the Parent Company balance sheet and 

statement of changes in equity. 

FRS 101 exemptions 

In these financial statements, the Company has applied the 

exemptions under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: 

–  cash flow statement and related notes 

–  financial instruments and fair values 

–  share-based payments 

–  transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries 

–  compensation of key management personnel 

–  capital management 

Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 

at the rates of exchange ruling at the year-end. Gains and losses 

arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for 

the period. 

Financial assets and liabilities 

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s 

balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 

provisions of the instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be 

party to such provisions. Financial assets are classified as current if 

they are expected to be received within 12 months of the balance 

sheet date. Financial liabilities are classified as current if they are 

legally due to be paid within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

Basis of preparation continued 

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost 
unless they are part of a fair value hedge accounting relationship. 
Borrowings that are part of a fair value hedge accounting relationship 
are measured at amortised cost adjusted for the fair value attributable 
to the risk being hedged. 

Deferred tax 

Deferred tax is provided at the anticipated rates on temporary 
differences arising from the inclusion of items of income and 
expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in 
which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely 
than not that they will be recovered. 

Share-based payments 

Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings are initially measured at 
fair value and are subsequently reported at amortised cost. Provisions 
on intra-group receivables are calculated at an amount equal to the 
lifetime expected credit losses using historic and forward-looking data 
on credit risk. 

The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees which are measured at fair value at the date of grant using 
option pricing models. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period based on the Company’s estimate of the 
number of shares expected to vest. 

Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings are initially measured at fair 
value and are subsequently reported at amortised cost. 

Non-interest-bearing payables are stated at their nominal value as 
they are due on demand. 

Dividends 

Interim dividends are recognised in the financial statements when 
they are paid. Final dividends, which are subject to approval by the 
shareholders in a general meeting after the balance sheet date, are 
not included as a liability in the financial statements. Instead, they are 
disclosed as a post-balance sheet event and recognised in the 
financial statements when they are approved (see note 7). 

The issue of share incentives by the Company to employees of its 
subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions. An addition to 
the Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings is reported with 
a corresponding increase in shareholders’ funds. For details of the 
charge, see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Financial guarantees and loan commitments 

Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their 
fair values. These liabilities are subsequently measured at the higher 
of the expected credit loss determined under IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments and the initial fair value.

During the year, the Company subscribed for shares in a direct subsidiary company, Hospitality Holdings Limited, for consideration totalling 
£5.6bn as part of a restructuring of certain intra-group loans which resulted in an increase in investments in subsidiary undertakings of £5.6bn 
and a corresponding change in balances with subsidiary undertakings. 

On the basis that the Company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings mainly comprise an investment in Hospitality Holdings Limited, which 
indirectly owns all of the Company’s trading businesses, there are no indicators that the carrying value may be impaired. 

The principal subsidiary undertakings are listed in note 36 to the consolidated financial statements.

Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings may be interest-free or interest-bearing loans. Interest-free loans are repayable on demand. Interest-
bearing loans incur interest at fixed rates (between 4.0% and 7.25%) or various floating rates with margins ranging from -0.15% to +1.50% 
(subject to a minimum all-in rate of 0%) and have maturities ranging from repayable on demand up to May 2031. 

The book value of amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings falling due within one year approximates to fair value due to the short-term nature of 
these receivables. The fair value of amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings falling due after more than one year is £5,556m (2022: £7,452m). 

Details of the derivative financial instruments are shown in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

During the year, the Company subscribed for shares in a direct subsidiary company, Hospitality Holdings Limited, for consideration totalling 

£5.6bn as part of a restructuring of certain intra-group loans which resulted in an increase in investments in subsidiary undertakings of £5.6bn 

and a corresponding change in balances with subsidiary undertakings. 

The Company has a £2,000m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) committed to August 2026. At 30 September 2023, no amounts were drawn under 
the RCF (2022: £nil). 

On the basis that the Company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings mainly comprise an investment in Hospitality Holdings Limited, which 

indirectly owns all of the Company’s trading businesses, there are no indicators that the carrying value may be impaired. 

The Company has a $4bn commercial paper programme. Commercial paper is issued to meet short-term liquidity requirements and is supported 
by the RCF. At 30 September 2023, no commercial paper was outstanding under the programme (2022: £nil). 

Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings may be interest-free or interest-bearing loans. Interest-free loans are repayable on demand and 
classified as current. Interest-bearing loans incur interest at fixed rates (between 0.73% and 3.10%) or various floating rates with margins ranging 
from -0.15% to +1.50% (subject to a minimum all-in rate of 0%) and have maturities ranging from repayable on demand up to September 2048. 

The book value of amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings falling due within one year approximates to fair value due to the short-term nature of 
these payables. The fair value of amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings falling due after more than one year is shown below:

Identity theft

We offer the following advice to shareholders on protecting their 
personal information and Compass Group PLC shares:

 – keep all Compass correspondence in a safe place, or destroy 

correspondence by shredding

 – when changing address, inform the registrar, Link Group. If a letter 
is received from Link Group regarding a change of address and 
there has been no change of address, contact the registrar 
immediately using the contact information at the top of this page
 – have dividends paid directly into a bank or building society account. 
This will reduce the risk of a cheque being intercepted or lost in the 
post. Contact the registrar for further information

 – on changing a bank or building society account, inform the registrar 
of the details of the new account and respond, as requested, to any 
letters Link Group send regarding this matter

Warning about share fraud

Investment scams are often sophisticated and difficult to spot. 
Fraudsters are persuasive and use high-pressure tactics to lure 
investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in 
return for an up-front payment. Whilst high profits are promised, if 
shares are bought or sold in this way, it is likely the money for the 
purchase or from the sale will be lost. These operations are commonly 
known as ‘boiler room’ scams. Shareholders should be wary if they are 
contacted out of the blue, pressured to invest quickly or promised 
returns that sound too good to be true. The higher the return 
promised, the more likely it’s a high-risk investment or a scam.

Shareholder Information

Shareholder information continued

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued some guidance for 
shareholders on how to recognise and avoid investment fraud:

 – legitimate firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact 

you unexpectedly with an offer to buy or sell shares

 – if you receive an unsolicited phone call, do not get into a 

conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting 
you and then end the call

 – check the Financial Services Register available at  

register.fca.org.uk/S/ to see if the person and firm contacting you is 
authorised by the FCA. If you wish to call the person or firm back, 
only use the contact details listed on the register

 – call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have any 

contact details on the FCA’s register, or if you are told that they 
are out of date

 – search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at  
www.fca.org.uk/warning/list-unauthorised-firms

 – if you do buy or sell shares through an unauthorised firm, you will 
not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme

 – consider obtaining independent financial and professional advice 

before you hand over any money.

Report a firm or scam by contacting the FCA’s Consumer Helpline on 
0800 111 6768 or using the FCA’s reporting form which can be found 
on their website, www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart. If a shareholder has 
already invested in a scam, fraudsters are likely to target them again 
or sell their details to other criminals. The follow-up scam may be 
separate or related to the previous fraud, such as an offer to get a 
shareholder’s money back or to buy back the investment after they 
have paid a fee. Any concerns about a potential scam should be 
reported to the FCA immediately.
