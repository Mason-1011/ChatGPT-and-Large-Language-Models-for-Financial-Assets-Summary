Reinsurance 
The Group cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business for 
the purpose of limiting its net loss potential through the 
diversification of its risks. Reinsurance arrangements, including 
quota share, excess of loss and adverse development cover 
contracts, do not relieve the Group from its direct obligations to its 
policyholders. Only contracts that give rise to a significant transfer of 
insurance risk are accounted for as reinsurance contracts. Amounts 
recoverable under such contracts are generally recognised in the 
same year as the related claim. Contracts that do not transfer 
significant insurance risk (i.e. financial reinsurance) are accounted 
for as financial instruments. 

Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurance 
companies for reinsurance claims. Amounts recoverable from 
reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the 
outstanding claims provision or settled claims associated with the 
reinsured policy. The earned portion of reinsurance premiums 
(insurance premium income ceded to reinsurers) is recognised as 
reinsurance premium expense. The provision for unearned 
reinsurance premiums comprises the element of reinsurance 
premiums relating to services to be received in future years. 
Amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts are assessed for 
impairment at each year-end date. Such assets are deemed 
impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that 
occurred after initial recognition, that the Group may not recover all 
amounts due and that the event has a reliably measurable impact on 
the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer. 

Provision for outstanding claims 
The provision for outstanding claims represents the Group’s 
estimate of the ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred but 
unpaid at the reporting date whether reported or not, and related 
internal and external claims handling expenses. Claims outstanding 
are assessed by reviewing individual claims data and making an 
allowance for claims incurred but not yet reported, adjusted for the 
effect of both internal and external foreseeable events, such as 
changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial trends, 
substantively enacted legislative changes and past experience and 
trends. Reinsurance and other recoveries are assessed in a manner 
similar to the claims outstanding and presented separately as assets. 

Unearned premium and unexpired risk provision 
The provision for unearned premiums comprises the proportion of 
gross premiums written, which is estimated to be earned in the 
following or subsequent accounting periods, calculated separately 
for each insurance contract using the daily pro rata method, 
adjusted if necessary to reflect any variation in the incidence of risk 
during the period covered by the contract. Where the value of 
expected claims and expenses attributable to unexpired periods of 
policies in force exceeds the unearned premium provision, a further 
provision is made, calculated by reference to classes of business 
which are managed together. 

Alternative performance measures (APMs) 
In the reporting of financial information, the Directors have adopted 
various APMs. Refer to the Glossary for a full list of the Group’s 
APMs, including comprehensive definitions, their purpose, 
reconciliations to IFRS measures and details of any changes to APMs. 

Judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of the consolidated Group financial statements 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions in applying the Group’s accounting policies to 
determine the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions to accounting estimates 
applied prospectively. 

Financial statements 

Critical accounting judgements 
Critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that are 
applied in the preparation of the consolidated Group financial 
statements are discussed below:  

Leases 
Management exercises judgement in determining the likelihood of
exercising break or extension options in determining the lease term. 
Break and extension options are included to provide operational 
flexibility should the economic outlook for an asset be different to 
expectations, and hence at commencement of the lease, break or 
extension options are not typically considered reasonably certain to 
be exercised, unless there is a valid business reason otherwise.  

The discount rate used to calculate the lease liability is the rate 
implicit in the lease, if it can be readily determined, or the lessee’s 
incremental borrowing rate if not. Management uses the rate implicit 
in the lease where the lessor is a related party (such as leases from 
joint ventures) and the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate for all 
other leases. Incremental borrowing rates are determined monthly 
and depend on the term, country, currency and start date of the 
lease. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on a 
series of inputs including: the risk-free rate
bond rates; a country-specific risk adjustment; a credit risk 
adjustment based on Tesco bond yields; and an entity-specific 
adjustment where the entity risk profile is different to that of 
the

based on government 

Group. 

Refer to Note 12 for additional disclosures relating to leases. 

Joint ventures and associates 
The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements under 
IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ and determined them to be joint 
ventures. These assessments required the exercise of judgement 
as

set out in Note 13. 

APMs – Adjusting items 
Adjusting items relate to certain costs or incomes that derive from 
events or transactions that fall within the normal activities of the 
Group but which, individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, 
excluded from the Group’s APMs by virtue of their size and

apply to IFRS measurements, and this assessment covers the nature 
of the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of that 
item on reported performance and individual financial statement 
line
items, as well as consistency with prior periods. Reversals of 
previous adjusting items are assessed based on the same criteria to 
ensure an even-handed treatment of gains and losses. The amount 
and timing of adjusting items can be unpredictable and subject to a 
higher level of scrutiny by users of the accounts. Adjusting items can 
include, but are not limited to: litigation costs; impairment charges 
and reversals; property transactions such as disposals; amortisation 
of acquired intangibles; changes in uncertain tax positions; 
restructuring and redundancy costs; profits or losses on disposal 
of
businesses; net pension finance income/(costs); and fair value 
remeasurements of financial instruments. The tax effect of such 
items is also classified as adjusting.  

The Group income statement is presented in a columnar format 
enable users of the accounts to see the Group’s performance 
to
before adjusting items, the adjusting items, and the statutory total 
on a line-by-line basis. An analysis of the adjusting items included in 
the Group income statement, together with the impact of these 
items on the Group cash flow statement, is disclosed in Note 4. 

Refer to pages 207 to 212 for further details on the Group’s APMs.

Clubcard points breakage 
Clubcard points breakage is the proportion of points that are not 
expected to be redeemed by customers. Management estimates 
breakage based on historical experience of customer redemptions, 
adjusted for any factors which may impact future redemption rates 
such as scheme changes or expected future trends in customer 
behaviour. Changes in breakage estimates would change the 
Clubcard contract liability (deferred revenue) on balance sheet (see 
Note 19) and the timing of revenue recognised in relation to Clubcard 
points. 

Contingent liabilities 
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be 
confirmed only on the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain 
future events outside the Group’s control, or present obligations 
that are not recognised because it is not probable that a settlement 
will be required or the value of such a payment cannot be reliably 
estimated. The Group does not recognise contingent liabilities but 
discloses them. Refer to Note 34 for the disclosures.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty  
The key assumptions about the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the reporting period end, that may have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying

Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group evaluates goodwill and non-current assets for impairment 
as set out in Note 14. The key assumptions and estimates to which 
the recoverable amounts are most sensitive, the methodology for 
calculating them and sensitivities are also disclosed in Note 14. 

Tesco Bank ECL measurement 
The measurement of ECLs for Tesco Bank financial assets requires 
the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future 
macroeconomic conditions and credit behaviour, such as the 
likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses.

Key
disclosed

in Note 27. 

Other significant estimates 
Other estimates for which management believes there is a limited 
risk of a material change in the amounts recognised or disclosed in 
the next financial year are discussed below: 

Commercial income 
Management is required to make estimates in determining the 
amount and timing of recognition of commercial income for some
transactions with suppliers. In determining the amount of volume-
related allowances recognised in any period, management estimates 
the probability that the Group will meet contractual target volumes, 
based on historical and forecast performance. There is limited 
estimation involved in recognising income for promotional and 
other

allowances.  

Management assesses its performance against the obligations 
conditional on earning the income, with the income recognised 
either over time as the obligations are met, or recognised at the 
point when all obligations are met, dependent on the contractual 
requirements. Commercial income is recognised as a credit within 
cost of sales. Where the income earned relates to inventories which 
are held by the Group at period ends, the income is included within 
the cost of those inventories, and recognised in cost of sales upon 
sale of those inventories. Management views that the cost of 
inventories sold (which is inclusive of commercial income) provides a 
consistent and complete measure of the Group income statement 
impact of the overall supplier relationships. 

Management considers the best indicator of the estimation 
undertaken is by reference to commercial income balances not 
settled at the balance sheet date, and has therefore provided 
additional disclosures of commercial income amounts reflected in 
the Group balance sheet. Refer to Note 20 for commercial income 
disclosures.

Note 2 Segmental reporting 
The Group’s operating segments are determined based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). 
The
CODM has been determined to be the Group Chief Executive, with support from the Executive Committee, as the function primarily 
responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and assessment of performance of the segments. 

The principal activities of the Group are presented in the

following segments: 

–  Retailing and associated activities (Retail) in: 

–  UK & ROI – the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland; and 
–  Central Europe – Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. 

–  Retail banking and insurance services through Tesco Bank in the UK (Tesco Bank). 

This presentation reflects how the Group’s operating performance is reviewed internally by management. 

The CODM uses adjusted operating profit, as reviewed at monthly Executive Committee meetings, as the key measure of the segments’ results 
as
it reflects the segments’ trading performance that aids comparability over time for the financial year under evaluation. Adjusted operating 
profit is a consistent measure within the Group as defined within the Glossary. Refer to Note 4 for adjusting items. Inter-segment revenue 
between the segments is not material. 

Income statement

The following tables showing segment assets and liabilities exclude those balances that make up net debt (cash and cash equivalents, short-term 
investments, joint venture loans, bank and other borrowings, lease liabilities, derivative financial instruments and net debt of the disposal group). 
With the exception of lease liabilities which have been allocated to each segment, and Tesco Bank net debt, all other components of net debt 
have been included within the unallocated segment to reflect how these balances are managed. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
other than intercompany transactions with Tesco Bank in net debt.

Deferred tax 
The following are the major deferred tax (liabilities)/assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior 
financial years, measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on the tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to utilise deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses. This assessment is based on the Group’s three-
year long-term plan which is updated and approved annually by the Board and is consistent with the Group’s longer-term viability statement and 
impairment assessments.

(a)  Property-related items include a deferred tax liability on rolled-over gains of £421m (2022: £423m), deferred tax assets on capital losses of £242m (2022: £248m) and deferred tax assets on IFRS 16 

balances of £235m (2022: £238m). The remaining balance relates to accelerated tax depreciation. 

(b) The deferred tax asset on retirement benefits includes a deferred tax asset of £155m (2022: £275m) arising from a one-off contribution of £2.5bn paid in December 2020 on which tax deductions 

are spread over 4 years, with the remaining balance related to the pension schemes in deficit. Refer to Note 29 for further details.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities 
Deferred tax assets in relation to continuing operations have not been recognised in respect of the following items, because it is not probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits:

As at 25 February 2023, the Group has unused trading tax losses from continuing operations of £1,177m (2022: £590m) available for offset against 
future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £584m (2022: £26m) of such losses, with £571m (2022: £12m) arising in the 
UK and £13m (2022: £14m) in other jurisdictions. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining overseas trading tax losses 
of £593m (2022: £564m) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams, with £552m (2022: £527m) arising in the Netherlands, £34m (2022: 
£33m) in Germany and £7m (2022: £4m) in other jurisdictions. Capital losses of £95m in ROI (2022: £91m) have not been recognised as it is not 
expected they will be utilised. There are no losses that will expire included in unrecognised losses. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in 
respect of deductible temporary differences of £45m (2022: £47m) as it is not expected they will be utilised. There is no expiry date for these 
temporary differences. 

No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £4.3bn (2022: £4bn) relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries and joint ventures as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that 
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The deferred tax on unremitted earnings at 25 February 2023 is estimated to be £6m (2022: £5m) 
which relates to taxes payable on repatriation and dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions. UK tax legislation relating to 
company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most repatriated profits, subject to certain exceptions.

Note 6 Taxation continued 
Changes in tax law or its interpretation  
The Group operates in a number of territories and so the Group’s profits are subject to tax in many jurisdictions. The Group monitors income tax 
developments in these territories which could affect the Group’s tax liabilities. The Group notes recent developments in relation to the OECD 
Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting but does not expect it to have a material impact on the Group’s tax charge.

(b) The assets classified as held for sale consist mainly of properties in the UK, Poland and Central Europe due to be sold within one year. Due to the individual nature of each property, fair values are 

classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 

Assets classified as held for sale 
During the year the Group sold 17 malls and one retail park in Central Europe, leasing back 17 stores within those sites. Net proceeds from the sale 
and leaseback transaction were £203m. As the sale and leaseback proceeds did not exceed the fair value of the stores sold, the proceeds are 
presented in the ‘investing’ category in the Group cash flow statement. The profit on disposal was £37m. Refer to Note 4. Refer to Note 12 for 
details on the leaseback of the stores.

Note 12 Leases 
Group as lessee 
Lease liabilities represent rentals payable by the Group for certain retail, distribution and office properties and other assets such as motor 
vehicles. The leases have varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights. Purchase options and renewal rights, where 
they occur, are at market value. Escalation clauses are in line with market practices and include inflation-linked, fixed rates, resets to market 
rents and hybrids of these. 

On 6 October 2022, the Group obtained control of The Tesco Dorney Limited Partnership (2022: The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership on 17 
December 2021), previously accounted for as a joint venture, through the acquisition of the other partner’s 50% interest, at which point the 
associated property leases from the joint venture became intercompany leases. Refer to Note 33 for further details.

Sale and leaseback 
During the year the Group sold 17 malls and one retail park in Central Europe, leasing back 17 stores within those sites. Refer to Note 7 for details 
on the net proceeds and profit from the transaction. The stores are being leased back over a 15-year lease term at below-market rentals with 
options to extend, and the store leases have resulted in lease liability additions of £36m. The sale and leaseback transaction allows the Group to 
relinquish control over the malls while continuing to operate the stores within those sites.  

Amounts recognised in the Group cash flow statement

Future possible cash outflows not included in the lease liability 
Some leases contain break clauses or extension options to provide operational flexibility. Potential future undiscounted lease payments not 
included in the reasonably certain lease term, and hence not included in lease liabilities, total £9.1bn (2022: £9.5bn). 

Future increases or decreases in rentals linked to an index or rate are not included in the lease liability until the change in cash flows takes effect. 
Approximately 76% (2022: 75%) of the Group’s lease liabilities are subject to inflation-linked rentals, of which 86% (2022: 87%) have inflation caps, 
with a weighted average cap of 3.4% (2022: 4.1%). A further 16% (2022: 16%) are
subject to rent reviews. Rental changes linked to inflation or rent 
reviews typically occur on an annual or five-yearly basis. Of the inflation-linked leases with caps, 30% (2022: 29%) of the lease liability value was 
hedged through index-linked swaps (refer to Note 27).  

The Group is committed to payments totalling £110m (2022: £54m) in relation to leases that have been signed but have not yet commenced.

Note 13 Group entities 
The Group consists of the ultimate Parent Company, Tesco PLC, and a number of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates held directly or
indirectly by Tesco PLC. See pages 199 to 203 for a complete list of Group entities. 

Subsidiaries 
The accounting year ends of the subsidiaries consolidated in these financial statements are on or around 25 February 2023.  

Unconsolidated structured entities 
In prior years, the Group sponsored a number of structured entities. The Group led the formation of the entities and its name appears in the 
name of the entities and/or on the debt issued by the entities. The structured entities were set up to finance property purchases by some of the 
UK property joint ventures in which the Group typically holds a 50% equity interest. The structured entities obtain debt financing from third-party 
investors and lend the funds to these joint ventures, who use the funds to purchase the properties. 

The liabilities of the UK property joint ventures include the loans due to these structured entities. The Group’s exposure to the structured entities 
is limited to the extent of the Group’s interests in the joint ventures. The liabilities of the structured entities are non-recourse to the Group. 

The Group concluded that it does not control, and therefore should not consolidate, these structured entities since it does not have power over 
the relevant activities of the structured entities, or exposure to variable returns from these entities.  

Consolidated structured entities 
The Group has a number of securitisation structured entities established in connection with Tesco Bank’s credit card securitisation transactions 
as well as financing structured entities controlled as a result of the acquisition of UK property joint ventures. Although none of the equity of these 
entities is owned by the Group, the Group has rights to variable returns from its involvement with these entities and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over them under contractual agreements. As
therefore accounted for as subsidiaries of the Group.

Financial statements 

The accounting period end dates of the joint ventures and associates consolidated in these financial statements range from 31 December 2022 
25 February 2023. The accounting period end dates of joint ventures differ from those of the Group for commercial reasons and depend 
to
upon
the requirements of the joint venture partner as well as those of the Group. The accounting period end dates of the associates are 
different from those of the Group as they depend upon the requirements of the parent companies of those entities. 

There are no significant restrictions on the ability of joint ventures and associates to transfer funds to the parents, other than those imposed by 
the Companies Act 2006 or equivalent local regulations.  

The UK property joint ventures involve the Group partnering with third parties in carrying out some property investments in order to enhance 
returns from property and access funding, while reducing risks associated with sole ownership. These property investments generally cover 
shopping centres and standalone stores. The Group enters into leases for some or all of the properties held in the joint ventures. These leases 
provide the Group with some rights over alterations and adjacent land developments. In some cases the Group has the ability to substitute 
properties in the
property management activities for third-party rentals of shopping centre units. 

joint ventures with alternative properties of similar value, subject to strict eligibility criteria. In other cases, the Group carries out 

The property investment activities are carried out in separate entities, usually partnerships or limited liability companies. The Group has assessed 
its ability to direct the relevant activities of these entities and any impact on Group returns and concluded that the entities qualify as joint 
ventures since decisions regarding them require the unanimous consent of both equity holders. This assessment included not only rights within 
the joint venture agreements, but also any rights within other contractual arrangements between the Group and the entities. 

The Group made a number of judgements in arriving at this determination, the key ones being: 

–  since the provisions of the joint venture agreements require the relevant decisions impacting investor returns to be either unanimously agreed 
by both joint venturers at the same time, or in some cases to be agreed sequentially by each venturer at different stages, there is joint decision 
making within the joint venture; 

–  since the Group’s leases are priced at fair value, and any rights embedded in the leases are consistent with market practice, they do not 
provide the Group with additional control over the joint ventures nor do they infer an obligation by the Group to fund the settlement of 
liabilities of the joint ventures; 

–  any options to purchase the other joint venturers’ equity stakes are priced at market value, and only exercisable at future dates, hence they 

do

not provide control to the Group at the current time; 

–  where the Group has a right to substitute properties in the joint ventures, the rights are strictly limited and are at fair value, hence do not 

provide control to the Group; and 

–  where the Group carries out property management activities for third-party rentals in shopping centres, these additional activities are 

controlled through joint venture agreements or lease agreements, and do not provide the Group with additional powers over the joint venture. 

During the current financial year, the Group obtained control of The Tesco Dorney Limited Partnership, which was previously accounted for as a 
joint venture, through the acquisition of the other partner’s 50% interest. Refer to Note 33 for further details.

The majority of the net impairment charge relates to increased discount rates due to increases in government bond rates as a result of the prevailing 
macroeconomic uncertainty. See the Key assumptions and sensitivity section of this note for applicable discount rates. Property fair values in the 
UK have also decreased due to the weakening of the property investment market in the last six months, which has led to increased yields.  

The remaining other non-current assets impairment losses and reversals for the Group largely reflect normal fluctuations expected from  
store-level performance, as well as any specific store closures. 

Net carrying value of non-current assets

Impairment methodology 
Cash-generating units 
The Group treats each store as a separate cash-generating unit for impairment testing of other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, 
right of use assets and investment property. The Group allocates goodwill to groups of cash-generating units, where each country represents a 
group of cash-generating units for the Group’s retail operations, as this represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by 
management. Tesco Bank and dunnhumby each represent separate cash-generating units. 

The recoverable amount of each store cash-generating unit is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. The 
recoverable amount of a group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is determined based on value in use calculations. 

Central assets such as distribution centres and associated costs are allocated to store cash-generating units based on level of
use, estimated 
with reference to sales. Urban fulfilment centres and associated costs that are part of a store are included in the store cash–generating unit. 
Standalone customer fulfilment centres and associated costs are each treated as a separate cash-generating unit.  

Value in use 
Retail  
Estimates for value in use calculations include discount rates, long-term growth rates, expected changes to future cash flows, including volumes 
and prices, and the probabilities assigned to cash flow scenarios. Estimates are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in 
the market, including the prevailing economic climate and global economy, competitor activity, market dynamics, changing customer behaviours, 
structural challenges facing retail and the resilience afforded by the Group’s operational scale.  

Cash flow projections are based on the Group’s three-year internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. The forecasts 
include best estimate assumptions on inflation, which differ by both country and revenue and cost categories. The forecasts are extrapolated to 
five years based on management’s expectations, and beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates. Long-term growth 
rates for the Retail business are based on inflation forecasts by recognised bodies. Cash flow forecasts are allocated to store-level cash-
generating units based on their relative current year actual sales performance, after adjusting for one-off cash flows affecting particular stores.

applied to the cash flows derived from the three-year internal forecasts. Additional scenarios take account of the risks

Note 14 Impairment of non-current assets continued 
The Group applies an expected cash flow approach by probability-weighting different cash flow scenarios. The greatest probability weighting 
is
presented by a 
macroeconomic downturn, higher levels of operating costs and climate change, consistent with the viability statement scenarios (see the
Longer
term viability statement in the Strategic report) as well as an upside scenario. The viability statement scenarios reflect ‘severe but 
plausible’ risks which are adjusted for impairment testing in order to reflect management’s best estimate of future economic conditions, 
including any reasonably possible upside to the three-year internal forecasts. 

In addition to the climate change scenario included within the probability-weighted cash flows, the Group incorporates other climate change 
related assumptions into the impairment modelling, including, but not limited to, investments in technology to aid the Group’s net zero 
commitments, the costs associated with replacing assets with more environmentally-friendly alternatives, and assumptions over the cash flow 
profile of the Group’s fuel business. 

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the market assessment as at the balance sheet date of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. The pre-tax discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average 
cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region and on a nominal basis. Risk-free rates are based on 
government bond rates in each
geographical region and equity risk premia and equity beta are based on forecasts by recognised bodies. 
The

Group uses the capital asset pricing model to calculate the cost of equity. 

Tesco Bank goodwill 
Tesco Bank value in use is calculated by discounting equity cash flows, defined as the excess above the regulatory requirement. Cash flow 
projections are based on the Bank’s three-year internal forecasts, approved by the Board. The forecasts are extrapolated to five years based 
on
on inflation and GDP growth forecasts by recognised bodies. The discount rate is the cost of equity of Tesco Bank. Risk-free rates, equity risk 
premia and the equity beta are derived from recognised bodies.

Fair value less costs of disposal 
Fair values of owned properties are determined with regard to the market rent for the stores or for alternative uses with investment yields 
appropriate to reflect the physical characteristics of the property, location, infrastructure, redevelopment potential and other factors. In
cases, fair values include residual valuations where stores may be viable for redevelopment. Fair values of leased properties are determined 
with
property and the local rental market, adjusted for a suitable void period. Fair values of the Group’s properties were determined with the 
assistance of independent professional valuers where appropriate. Costs of disposal are estimated based on past experience in each 
geographical region.

The recoverable values of investments in joint ventures and associates are estimated taking into account forecast cash flows, equity valuations of 
comparable entities and/or recent transactions for comparable businesses. 

Key assumptions and sensitivity

Sensitivity  
The Group has carried out sensitivity analyses on the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions in the impairment tests for (a) each group 
of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated and (b) for its portfolio of store cash-generating units. Management has extended 
the reasonably possible movements in the future cash flows and property fair values sensitivities disclosed given the level of volatility seen in 
these inputs since the previous year end, driven by the wider macroeconomic environment. 

(a)  Except for Tesco Bank goodwill, neither a reasonably possible increase of 1.0%pt in discount rates, a 10.0% decrease in future cash flows nor 
a 1.0%pt decrease in long-term growth rates would indicate impairment in any group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated.

(b)  While there is not a significant risk of an adjustment to the carrying amount of any one store cash-generating unit that would be material 
to the Group as a whole in the next financial year, the table below summarises the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which 
most impact the impairment of the Group’s entire portfolio of store cash-generating units, presented in aggregate due to the large 
number of individually immaterial store cash-generating units. The impairment is not highly sensitive to the probability weightings 
assigned to the cash flow scenarios.

(a)  Bank loans and overdrafts includes £900m (2022: £574m) of bank overdrafts. £895m (2022: £567m) is held under a notional pooling arrangement which does not meet the criteria to be

presented 

net of cash on the balance sheet. Refer to Note 18. 

(b) These notes are 3.5% Tesco Bank MREL compliant senior debt and were issued on 25 July 2019. The scheduled redemption date is July 2024. During the year there was a partial redemption by 

Tesco Bank of its issued MREL debt. 

(c)  The bonds are secured by a charge over the property, plant and equipment held within The Tesco Property Limited Partnership, The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership, The Tesco Sarum Limited 
Partnership and The Tesco Dorney Limited Partnership respectively, all of which are 100% owned subsidiaries of Tesco PLC. The carrying amount of assets pledged as security for secured bonds 
is £802m, £1,065m, £708m and £239m (2022: £818m, £892m, £521m and £nil), respectively. £51m (2022: £50m) is the total principal repayment due within the next 12 months and the remainder is 
payable in quarterly instalments until the maturity date. 

(d) These bonds are redeemable at par, indexed for increases in the RPI over the life of the MTN. However, for the LPI-linked bond, the maximum indexation of the principal in any one year is 5%, with 

a minimum of 0%. For the RPI-linked bond, refer to Note 27.  

(e)  These are sustainability-linked bonds referencing the Group’s KPI for Group Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions reduction (Scope 1 and 2, in tCO2e). The Sustainability Performance Target they are 

linked to is to reduce the Group GHG Emissions by 60% by 2025 with respect to a 2015/16 baseline.

Provisions are discounted based on the relevant risk-free rate and are risk-adjusted through adjusting the cash flow estimates. Refer to Note 14 
for details of how risk-free rates are derived. Where material, provisions are discounted based on country-specific nominal risk-free rates, with a 
weighted average risk-free rate of 3.8% (2022: 1.6%). 

Property provisions 
Property provisions comprise onerous contracts related to unprofitable stores and vacant properties, decommissioning provisions and 
remediation works and dilapidations provisions.  

Dilapidations are recognised where there is a present obligation to repair and restore leased properties to their preoccupancy state at the end 
of
the lease term. The provision is based on best estimates for individual properties, with reference to previous experience and size of leased 
property, or specific agreements with the landlord where relevant. The term is measured in accordance with the outstanding length of leases or 
the expected timing of specific obligations. 

Onerous contract provisions are recognised where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic 
benefits expected to be received under it. The timing of provisions is determined by reference to the contract giving rise to the obligations.  

Decommissioning provisions reflect the Group’s long-term obligation for site-level environmental remediation works, arising from government 
regulations and changing consumer habits. The extent and cost of future environmental remediation represents a best estimate applied across 
the property portfolio based on past experience, the extent of remediation work required and the expected timing of activity, for which there is a 
high level of uncertainty. 

Amounts provided in the year primarily relate to decommissioning and amounts released in the year primarily relate to releases of dilapidation 
and similar remediation provisions.

Restructuring provisions 
Restructuring provisions of £106m, primarily relating to expected employee costs, are expected to be fully utilised in the following financial year to 
24 February 2024. The provision is calculated in line with the expected settlement costs of impacted employees and excludes future operating costs.  

Legal and regulatory provisions 
Legal and regulatory provisions contain balances in relation to either ongoing or expected legal proceedings against the Group, or for costs 
associated with regulatory matters and/or breaches. Due to the nature of legal and regulatory matters, including unpredictable timings of legal 
cases or regulatory investigations, there is often uncertainty as to if or when provisions will be fully utilised.  

This balance consists of various individually immaterial provisions. 

Operational insurance provisions 
Insurance provisions relate to outstanding liabilities from public and employer’s liability and third-party motor claims across the Group’s trading 
operations, separate to the Tesco Underwriting insurance balances in Note 24. Provisions relate to claims arising from incidents reported prior 
to
the reporting date, including an allowance for those currently incurred but not reported. Amounts are measured considering claims history, 
including claims volume and average cost of claims, with assessment and projection by third-party actuaries. Releases in the year primarily relate 
to improved estimates of future outflows from revised actuarial valuations. The balance as at the financial year end is expected to be materially 
utilised within three years from the reporting date.  

Other provisions 
Other provisions amounts primarily relate to a Tesco Bank expected credit loss provision recognised under IFRS 9 which exceeds the gross 
carrying amount of the related financial asset, primarily loans to customers. Further information on expected credit losses can be found within 
Note 27. The remaining balance relates to individually immaterial provisions that do not fall into any of the other categories.

At 25 February 2023, £2.9bn (2022: £3.0bn) of the credit card portfolio had its beneficial interest assigned to a securitisation special purpose 
entity, Delamare Cards Receivables Trustee Limited, for use as collateral in securitisation transactions. The total encumbered portion of this 
portfolio is £1.1bn (2022: £1.2bn). 

At 25 February 2023, Delamare Cards MTN Issuer PLC had £1.8bn (2022: £1.8bn) notes in issue in relation to securitisation transactions.  

At 25 February 2023, £1.6bn (2022: £1.4bn) of the class A retained credit card-backed notes are held within their single collateral pool. 

Fair value hedge adjustments 
Fair value hedge adjustments amounting to a liability of £75m (2022: liability of £30m) are in respect of fixed rate personal loans. These 
adjustments are largely offset by derivatives, which are used to manage interest rate risk and are designated as fair value hedges of loans and 
advances to customers. 

Refer to Note 27 for allowance for expected credit losses disclosures.

Notes to the Group financial statements continued 

Note 24 Insurance continued 
Gross insurance provisions, unlike reinsurance assets, are classified as current or non-current based on contractual rights to defer settlement 
for at least 12 months after the reporting period, rather than expected timing of settlement. See Note 27 for the expected cash outflows in 
relation to these balances.

Funds withheld 
Funds withheld of £123m (2022: £115m), included within trade and other payables, represent the balance due to reinsurers arising from Quota 
Share arrangements, by which a fixed proportion of both premiums and losses are ceded to third-party reinsurers as part of the overall 
reinsurance protection strategy. 

Process used to determine assumptions 
The nature of insurance makes it very difficult to predict with certainty the likely outcome of any particular claim and the ultimate cost of notified 
claims. Each notified claim is assessed on a separate, case‐by‐case basis with due regard to the claim circumstances and historical evidence of 
the size of similar claims and provisions are based on information currently available. However, the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of 
subsequent developments.  

Sources of data 
The sources of data used as inputs for the assumptions are internal, using detailed studies that are carried out at least annually to ensure that 
the assumptions are consistent with observable market prices or other published information. When there is insufficient information to make a 
reliable best estimate of claims development, suitable benchmark assumptions are used. 

Methods 
The cost of outstanding claims and the incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims provisions are estimated using various statistical methods, which 
extrapolate the development of paid and incurred claims, average cost per claim and ultimate claim numbers for each accident period based 
upon observed development of earlier periods, with reference to suitable benchmarks. The key methods are: 

–  development factor methods, which use historical data to estimate the paid and incurred to date as proportions of the ultimate claim cost; 
–  individual claim assessment methods, which use claim‐specific details for large individual claims to estimate the ultimate claim cost; and 
–  benchmarking methods, which use the experience of comparable, more mature classes, or market data to estimate the cost of claims. 

To the extent that these methods use historical claims development information, they also assume that the historical claims development 
pattern will occur again in the future, after allowing (where possible) for instances where this might not be the case, such as changing economic 
or legal trends.

Recoveries 
The provisions are initially estimated at a gross level and a separate calculation is carried out to estimate the size of reinsurance recoveries.  
The Group is covered by a variety of excess of loss reinsurance programmes. The methods used by the Group take into account historical data, 
specific details for individual large claims and details of the reinsurance programme to assess the expected size of reinsurance recoveries. 
Recoveries through salvage and subrogation are estimated and recorded separately based on a combination of suitable benchmark assumptions 
and the observed development to date. 

Ogden rate 
The majority of claims are not discounted as they are expected to settle within four years or less. For long-term personal injury claims the 
personal injury discount rate (Ogden rate) is used. For claims provisions in relation to periodic payments orders, a long-term expected investment 
return is used as the discount rate. This is set by the Ministry of Justice and is used by the courts to calculate lump sum personal injury payments. 
Reserves are assessed at the current rate of (0.25)%.

(a)  The information in the above claims development table covers the period from which the earliest material claim arose in TU for which there is still uncertainty about the amount and timing of the 

claims payments and therefore reflects claims development in respect of claims arising prior to the acquisition of TU in 2021. 

(b) TU changed its reporting date from 31 December to 28 February during 2022. However, accident years remained consistent with a calendar year. Consequently, the first development year from 

2022 onwards represents only two months of claims development.

Fair value measurement by level of fair value hierarchy  
The following table presents the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, by level of fair value hierarchy: 

–  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1); 
–  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or 

indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and 

–  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3). 

exchange rates from highly liquid markets. For Level 3 assets and liabilities, uncollateralised derivatives are valued as per Level 2 but 

Level 2 assets are valued by discounting future cash flows using externally sourced market yield curves, including interest rate curves and 
foreign
include certain data sources which are significantly less liquid; unlisted investments are valued based on less observable inputs such as 
recent

funding rounds.

Level 3 Instruments 
During the financial year, there were £nil (2022: £nil) of transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 and £nil (2022: £nil) transfer from Level 3 to Level 1. There 
were £18m of transfers of unlisted investments (2022: £nil) and £(223)m of derivative liabilities (2022: derivative assets of £749m) to Level 3 from 
Level 2 and £nil (2022: £nil) to Level 3 from Level 1.  

As part of financial risk management, the Group holds certain uncollateralised derivative financial instruments, including interest rate and 
inflation swaps, cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. These are valued using relevant inputs which are considered observable (Level 2), 
such as forward rates and foreign exchange rates from available market data. Unobservable inputs (Level 3) relate to the funding valuation 
adjustment (FVA), which is the estimate of the adjustment to the fair value that a market participant would make to account for funding costs. 
These are calculated on the future valuation of the derivative, based on the best estimate available to management of suitable relevant cost of 
funds. A 10 basis points increase in the cost of funds would increase the FVA by £11m (2022: £18m). 

The following table presents the changes in Level 3 instruments:

For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements above, each agreement between the Group and the 
counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle on a net basis. In the absence of 
such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis. However, each party to the master netting agreement or similar 
agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.

Note 27 Financial risk management 
The Group’s financial risk management is carried out under policies approved and authority delegated by the Board of Directors, including 
parameters for risk management across the Group. The financial risk management in relation to Retail is carried out by a central treasury 
department. Tesco Bank has a separate formal structure for reporting, monitoring and managing its financial risks appropriate to the nature of its 
business as a regulated financial institution.  

The main financial risks faced by the Group, including Retail and Tesco Bank, and the management of these risks are set out below and include 
market risk (foreign exchange, interest rate, inflation and commodity prices), credit risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and insurance risk. Additional 
information on the management of the financial risks specifically relating to Tesco Bank is also set out on page 170.

denominated in a currency other than 
the functional currency of the 
purchasing company. 

Translation exposure that arises from 
exchange rate movements in 
connection with translating the Group’s 
foreign subsidiaries’ revenue and 
expenses, assets and liabilities into 
Pound Sterling.  

  Management policy  
  The Group’s policy is to hedge currency exposure that 
could significantly impact the Group income statement 
with a minimum (20%) and maximum (80%) hedge level 
of forecast uncommitted exposure within at least the 
next 12 months. 

  Translation risk related to foreign subsidiaries is not 
actively hedged, however to reduce this exposure in 
relation to the net assets of foreign subsidiaries, net 
investment hedging is undertaken.  

Loans to and from subsidiaries in 
currencies other than in the entity’s 
functional currency. 

  The Group’s policy is that 100% of the foreign exchange 
risk is hedged.  

Debt issued in a currency other than 
Pound Sterling. 

  The Group’s policy is to swap 100% of the foreign 
currency debt back to Pound Sterling, unless there are 
appropriate matching foreign currency assets.  

  Hedging strategy 
  Foreign currency forward contracts or purchased 
currency options, which are designated as cash flow 
hedges. These are denominated in the same currency 
as the highly probable future sales and purchases, 
which are expected to occur within a maximum 24-
month period, and the hedge ratio is determined 
to

1:1. 

be

  Euro-denominated borrowings are used to hedge the 
exposure of a portion of the Group’s net investments in 
overseas operations which have a
currency, against changes in value due to changes in 
foreign exchange rates. The Group has established a 
hedge ratio of 1:1, as the underlying risk of the hedging 
instrument is identical to the hedged risk component. 

Euro functional 

  Foreign currency derivatives and borrowings in 
matching currencies, which are not formally designated 
as accounting hedges as gains and losses will naturally 
offset in the income statement. 

  Cross-currency swaps, which are designated as fair 
value hedges. 

Residual exposure is present arising largely from cash and cash equivalents balances that are not in the functional currency of the entity holding 
these balances. The Group income statement impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on these residual balances is disclosed in the 
sensitivity table on page 164.  

Interest rate risk management 

Description of risks  
Debt issued at variable interest rates as 
well as cash deposits and short-term 
investments, giving rise to cash flow risk, 
and debt issued at fixed interest rates 
giving rise to fair value risk.  

  Management policy  
  The Group’s policy is to manage interest rate risk in 
total balance sheet debt (including senior unsecured 
debt, lease liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and 
investments) to a range of 55%-85% fixed. 

  Hedging strategy  
  Interest rate swap contracts are used to fix interest 
rates on senior unsecured debt or investments issued 
at floating rates, creating a fair value hedge; and for 
senior unsecured debt or investments issued at fixed 
rates to generate variable interest exposure, creating a 
cashflow hedge. The terms of the swap contracts 
match the terms of the borrowings or investments 
including notional amounts and maturity, interest 
settlement and interest rate reset dates, and the 
Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the 
hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the 
derivative contract is identical to that of the 
hedged

item.  

Different repricing dates of the assets 
and liabilities in Tesco Bank’s banking 
activities and unexpected changes to 
the yield curve, giving rise to volatility in 
earnings and economic value of these 
assets and liabilities. 

  Tesco Bank has established limits for risk appetite and 
stress tests are performed using sensitivity to 
fluctuations in underlying interest rates in order to 
monitor this risk. Tesco Bank also use the capital at risk 
approach, which assesses the sensitivity of a reduction 
in the Bank’s capital to movements in interest rates. 

  Tesco Bank uses interest rate swap contracts as fair 
value hedges, to swap fixed rate exposures of 
investment securities, loans and advances to 
customers and customer deposits, back to a 
benchmark floating rate where no existing offset is 
available. 

The scenarios considered include both parallel and 
non-parallel movements of the yield curve and have 
been designed to assess impacts across a suitable 
range of severe but plausible movements in 
interest

rates.
