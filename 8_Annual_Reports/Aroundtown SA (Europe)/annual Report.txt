Letter From
The CEO

Dear Stakeholders,

2023 has been a challenging year for the real estate sector, marked by a rapid hike in interest 
rates, increasing geopolitical tensions, and heightened economic uncertainty. Our pro-active 
management, diverse portfolio, conservative capital structure, and flexible business model 
enabled us to navigate these uncertain times and capitalize on some opportunities in this 
heightened market volatility. We executed strategic measures to strengthen our liquidity, balance 
sheet and operating platform and are ready to continue moving the company towards its long-
term objectives. In this letter, we are pleased to highlight our achievements on these fronts and 
share our insights on the current market environment. 

MARKET & PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE

2023 was marked by the rapid increase in central bank policy rates aimed at tackling high inflation rates across the eurozone. 

While these higher rates have successfully curbed inflation, uncertainty remains whether these measures will push EU countries 

into a recession. This economic uncertainty impacted the entire real estate sector resulting in devaluation recorded across all asset 

types. This year, the biggest impact was felt in the office sector. In the office sectore, we have seen impacts on tenant demand as 

businesses exercise more caution, delaying letting space expansion and relocation decisions. Consequently, we observe a certain 

decreased demand and a lower level of new lettings, with the leasing process taking longer. Conversely, we see an uptick in 

lease extensions, as tenants defer decisions until risks subside. On the positive side, high inflation rates have resulted in large 

increases in rents as our commercial leases are mostly CPI-indexed or have step-up rents, which more than compensated for the 

negative trend in the market, enabling solid rent like-for-like growth. Furthermore, increasing construction costs have resulted 

in significant cancellations of projects, resulting in a reduction in new supply in the coming years, which we expect will provide 

tailwinds in the mid-to long-term.

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report13

Due to prevailing market conditions, our office occupancy has seen a small decline 

as conferences took longer to recover. This slower recovery particularly affected certain 

which was more than offset by increasing rents, resulting in a 3.3% like-for-like rental 

hotel markets in Germany which rely in part on business travelers. Despite this, corporate

travel has bounced back to pre-pandemic levels and growth has stabilized. However, in 

which provides stability of cash flows. Furthermore, German and Dutch office markets 

2023 hotel tenants’ margins remained pressured due to cost inflation and widespread 

remain better positioned than US and UK markets, maintaining a healthy vacancy rate 

staffing shortages. However, we were able to increase our collection rate to 87%, up from 

even amidst economic uncertainty. German and Dutch office markets also showcase 

more efficient utilization of office space with higher attendance, fostering a sustainable 

hybrid model while US & UK office markets were oversupplied even before this period 

of economic uncertainty. Looking ahead, while we anticipate a further decrease in 

occupancy, we expect that rent increases will continue to offset this decline. As has 

always been the case, we will continue to proactively address challenges and capitalize 

on opportunities.

Our residential portfolio, our second largest asset type accounting for 33% of our total 

portfolio, held through our stake in GCP, continued to benefit from the widening supply-

demand gap in Germany and London. From an operational perspective, 2023 was a very 

strong year, with increasing rents and declining vacancies.  In both markets, the pace of 

new supply continues to substantially fail to keep up with strong demand and government 

targets, primarily due to higher material, labor, and financing costs, coupled with regulatory 

hurdles, making new construction economically less viable. Net migration remained high 

in 2023, and the impact of higher mortgage rates on home affordability which drives 

more people to rent collectively served as the primary catalysts for the heightened rental 

demand. Consequently, the residential portfolio vacancy reached an all-time low of 3.6%.

Low vacancy and strong demand also pushed rents higher, particularly in London, where 

rent adjustments are not regulated, enabling to capture inflation faster than in Germany. 

As a result, our residential portfolio recorded a like-for-like rental growth of 3.4% in 

2023. Throughout 2023 we slightly increased our holding rate in GCP to 63% currently 

as compared to 60% as of December 2022, utilizing the opportunity to strengthen our 

position in a stable and strong cash flow generating portfolio at an attractive share price. 

69% in 2022 and 48% in 2021. We believe that we have successfully navigated through 

the operational challenges we encountered during and after the pandemic, followed 

by the rapid increase in operational costs and operational disruptions. We expect to be 

back to pre-pandemic levels in 2024.

STRENGTHENED THE LIQUIDITY AND BALANCE SHEET THROUGH 
DISPOSALS, LIABILITY MANAGEMENT EXERCISES AND CASH RETENTION

During 2023, we reinforced our high liquidity position with disposals and new bank debt 

which supported our pro-active liability management activities. Our cash and liquid 

assets increased to €3 billion mainly from disposals and new debt funding, allowing for 

deleveraging activities. We closed over €1.2 billion of disposals during 2023 encompassing 

a variety of asset types, locations and deal sizes, including development rights. Our 

diversified portfolio and the extensive reach of our deal-sourcing network give us a 

competitive edge, allowing us to re-focus on markets that are relatively more active than 

others, while our strong liquidity position and clean debt maturity schedule provide us 

the time and flexibility to execute deals on terms we see as favorable. Signed disposals 

amounted to €0.9 billion in 2023, of which €0.2 billion was not closed as of 2023.

We accessed additional liquidity through bank financing where we utilized our strong 

banking relationships and large amount of unencumbered assets to sign ca. €1 billion 

in new bank debt, which has enabled us to increase our total liquidity and target bond 

buybacks. Our diversified asset mix and locations again gave us a competitive edge, 

especially in an environment with tightened lending standards. Our new bank debt, raised 

We expect the underlying market dynamics in our residential markets to persist in the

coming years, allowing us to benefit from these stable operational tailwinds while limiting

Additionally, we have utilized several measures to retain our cash liquidity which include a

In 2023, the fast increasing interest rates continued to negatively impact valuations 

business operations. The progress made signifies our commitment to advancing ESG 

across all asset types and locations. These elevated rates concurrently resulted in 

targets, and we remain dedicated to further enhancements to ensure the realization 

a muted transaction market marked by significantly lower volume than historical 

levels. The absence of robust transactional evidence introduced an additional layer 

of uncertainty, creating disparities among market participants’ expectations. However, 

strong rental growth in the portfolio and market rents have partially counteracted the 

effects of yield expansion on the valuations. In total, we registered a like-for-like value 

decline of 11% as of December 2023. Accordingly, the average yield increased from 4.5% 

in 2022 to 5.0% in 2023. Office properties were significantly impacted, experiencing 

a value decline of 13%. Residential assets registered a smaller decline compared to 

offices with 8%. Hotel assets have recorded the least devaluations at 6%, with the post-

of these goals.

Environmental

In 2023, our commitment to sustainability was reinforced by ongoing efforts to secure green 

certifications for our office portfolio, complemented by targeted green investments and 

refurbishments aimed at reducing emissions. Notably, we achieved significant milestones in 

BREEAM certification, fully certifying our Dutch office portfolio. The successful certification 

of the Dutch office portfolio, initiated as a pilot project in 2021, served as a foundation for 

knowledge transfer across the entire portfolio, leading to the certification of our first German

While the future trajectory of property valuations remains uncertain, a stable labor 

market and an economy that has defied gloomy expectations remain positive catalysts 

while any potential revival of the transaction markets due to lower rates would offer 

greater clarity moving forward.

Our deleveraging activities helped partially offset the negative valuation impacts. From 

June 2022 until year-end 2023, the property values declined by 14% while our LTV 

increased by 3 percentage points. As outlined above, deleveraging activities included 

Furthermore, we continued our renewable and energy efficiency investments in 2023. 

Leveraging green installations which target carbon reduction via installation of 

renewable energy systems, we equipped buildings with solar panels and energy efficient 

heating units (Combined Heat and Power) with a maximum capacity of over 6 million 
kWh pa, translating to over 2,000 tons of avoided CO2. In addition, we installed approx. 
400 EV charging sockets across our portfolio. These initiatives contribute to our society’s 
shared CO2 reduction path while also leading to improved green building certifications, 
heightened demand, and increased overall value. Parallel efforts focused on enhancing 

disposals, bond buybacks at discount, suspension of dividends, not exercising the option

we sustained meaningful partnerships with charities that delivered targeted assistance 

across our diverse portfolio locations, collaborating with local associations. Our projects 

were aimed at improving child and youth education and healthcare, fostering job readiness 

for disadvantaged young individuals, supporting initiatives for underprivileged youth, 

extending solidarity to ethnic minorities, and more. In 2023 alone, we made contributions 
to local partners through both the Aroundtown and GCP foundations spanning over 90 
impactful projects.

Additionally, our focus on delivering high-quality tenant services persisted across both 

commercial and residential sectors. Offering 24/7 tenant support company-wide, we 

achieved TÜV re-certification for both service centers in 2023. Notably, GCP’s residential 

tenant service center received the “Fairest Customer Service” award, while the migration 

of service requests to the GCP App enhanced efficiency and tenant satisfaction.

1)  SOURCING AND TARGETING ACQUISITIONS IN CENTRAL LOCATIONS 

Once a property is acquired, the actual takeover occurs swiftly and efficiently. Because 

IN TOP TIER CITIES WITH GROWTH AND UPSIDE POTENTIAL

Aroundtown’s property sourcing success stems from its unique network as well as 

its reputation as a reliable real estate acquisition partner. The Group focuses on 

acquiring value-add properties in central locations of top tier cities characterized by 

below market rent levels, inefficient cost or lease structure and/or vacancy reduction 

potential. With two decades of experience in the real estate markets, the Group 

benefits from a preferred buyer status across its sourcing network. The Group sources 

deals from a large and diverse deal sourcing base, such as receivers, banks, loan funds, 

broker networks, distressed owners, private and institutional investors and court 

auctions. The Group’s primary focus is on major cities and metropolitan areas with 

positive demographic prospects.

The Group follows acquisition criteria which ensure that newly acquired properties 

align with its business model. These criteria include:

liquidity plays a significant role in the acquisition of value-add properties, AT benefits 

strongly from its solid liquidity position and its ability to acquire properties with 

existing resources and refinance the acquisition at a later stage. The Group also 

benefits from a strong and experienced legal department, which, combined with 

close and longstanding relationships with external law firms, enables AT to complete 

multiple deals simultaneously.

3)  REPOSITIONING AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS

As a specific tailored business plan is constructed for each property, and the 

weaknesses and strengths are identified pre-acquisition, the execution of the 

repositioning process becomes smoother and faster. The business plan input is 

integrated into AT’s IT/ software platform which enables the management to monitor 

all operational and financial parameters and fully control the repositioning progress. 

The success of the repositioning of the properties is the result of the following 

•  Focus on central locations in top tier EU cities

functions:

•  Value-add potential through operational improvements

Operational and marketing initiatives

•  Cash flow generating assets

•  Rent level per sqm below market level (under-rented properties)

•  Purchase price below replacement cost and below market values

•  Potential to reduce operational cost per sqm significantly

Due to the experience and knowledge of its board and management, the Group is 

able to consider all possible uses for properties that it acquires, including altering 

the property’s primary use in order to target specific supply shortages in the market. 

The Group believes that its business model provides it with a strong and sustainable 

competitive advantage.

The initial repositioning activities aim at minimizing the time until the profitability of 

the acquired properties is improved. Targeted marketing activities are implemented 

to increase occupancy and thereby rental income. Vacancy reduction initiatives 

are tailored to the specific property type. Procedures applied to AT’s commercial 

properties include establishing a network of internal and external, as well as 

local and nationwide letting brokers, offering promotional features and building 

a reputation in the market for high service standards. For the Group’s hotel assets, 

optimal operators are selected and a fixed long-term lease contract is entered into 

once the hotel is repositioned. Initiatives for the Group’s residential properties target 

relationship building with potential tenants and the local community by collaborating

relationships with all stakeholders and have been embedded across AT’s business 

functions to ensure that their interests are represented and addressed. Aroundtown’s 

upstream value chain consists of its investors, its construction and development 

While the Group’s main focus is on extracting the potential of its portfolio, the Group 

also pursues an accretive capital recycling of non-core and/or mature properties. AT 

continuously analyzes its portfolio in terms of upside potential to lift and focuses 

its resources on properties with higher upside. AT seeks to dispose properties where 

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report19

most of the potential has been achieved or which are not in the core locations of 

AT. The disposal of such properties enables capital recycling and provides firepower 

to pursue new opportunities with high upside potential on one hand and increases 

the quality of the portfolio on the other.  Addionally, proceeds from disposals enable 

the Company to buy back debt, strengthen the balance sheet and reduce leverage.

5)  EXTRACTING BUILDING RIGHTS FROM UNUSED OR UNDERUTILIZED 
LAND OR CONVERSION RIGHTS FROM EXISTING PROPERTIES AND 
NEW LAND

As part of the value creation process, Aroundtown identifies and extracts building 

rights from unused or underutilized existing and new land and buildings and 

conversion rights, providing an additional internal growth driver. AT assesses 

internally the best use for the rights and advances on to maintain the discussion 

with authorities, engineers and architects in order to realize plans into permits. Once 

the planning and permit phases are completed, Aroundtown analyzes each project 

individually and decides the best way to realize the value into proceeds. Aroundtown 

does not intend to fully build and develop all of the rights and estimates that most 

of the rights will be disposed.

nied by a pipeline and acquisition of attractive properties and the successful tran-

remarkable growth since inception into one of the largest real estate companies 

in Europe has created two key benefits in this regard: on one hand, the ability to 

attract managers and employees that redefine the industry, and on the other hand 

the internalization of a knowledge and experience pool at a fraction of the cost in 

relation to its portfolio.

This knowledge is communicated and utilized across the Group and its business 

units which shapes its processes and operational improvements.

AT’s management possesses the knowledge that makes up its main competitive 

advantage, the ability to extract the operational and value potential from its assets. 

This includes the ability to execute the business plan successfully, which includes 

executing vacancy reduction activities, establishing cost efficiency measures, set-

ting rent increase processes, understanding tenant structures, and optimizing rental 

sition of the existing properties into mature assets, generating secure long-term 

cash flows. This large network also enables Aroundtown to dispose properties.

QUALITY LOCATIONS IN TOP TIER CITIES

The Group’s assets are primarily located in two of Europe’s strongest economies 

with AAA sovereign ratings: Germany and the Netherlands. Within these countries, 

the Group focuses on central locations in top tier cities including Germany’s capital 

Berlin, the financial center Frankfurt, the wealthiest cities Munich and Hamburg, the 

large metropolitan area of North Rhine-Westphalia, Netherlands’ financial center 

and capital Amsterdam, Europe’s biggest port Rotterdam and Germany’s dynamic 

metropolitan regions in the east Dresden and Leipzig. The Group’s assets are further 

diversified into other top cities with strong economic fundamentals, such as one 

of Europe’s main financial centers and most popular touristic destination, London.

FINANCIAL POLICY

Aroundtown has set a financial policy to improve its capital structure further:

•  LTV guidance below 45% on a sustainable basis

•  Debt to debt-plus-equity ratio at 45% (or lower) on a sustainable basis

•  Maintaining conservative financial ratios with a strong ICR

•  Unencumbered assets above 50% of total assets

•  Long debt maturity profile

•  Good mix of long-term unsecured bonds & bank loans

•  Dividend distribution of 75% of FFO I per share*

Aroundtown’s conservative capital structure, strong track record in accessing capital 

markets and its strong relationships to mortgage banks enable the Group to finance 

its funding needs. The Group maintains a robust liquidity position through a mix of 

operational cash flow generation and balance of cash and liquid assets which as of 

December 31, 2023 amounted to €3.0 billion. Additionally, undrawn RCF’s of €1 billion 

(no MAC) and a high ratio of unencumbered investment properties of 74% (by rent, 

€17.9 billion in total value) as of December 31, 2023 provide for additional financial 

flexibility.

General Information

PREPARATION OF THE NON-FINANCIAL REPORT

The content of this report and selected metrics (described as reviewed with relevant 

Internal stakeholders include, but are not limited to, Aroundtown employees from 

data tables) have been reviewed with limited assurance in accordance with the 

the following departments: Human Resources, Occupational Health and Safety, 

International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised). A statement 

Sustainability, Insurance, Data Protection, Real Estate Management, Risk Management, 

41

Energy, Water and Management, Rent Control and Increase, Finance, Advisory, and 

Compliance. Other stakeholders include value chain workers, business partners, 

investors and tenants.

2.  Problem Mapping

Interviews with key stakeholders were conducted to identify and map financial and non-

financial topics impacting Aroundtown. These interviews were categorized according to 

the ESRS standards and questions on these topics were addressed during the sessions.

3.  Data Validation

The information obtained through the interviews was validated by cross-referencing 

with other data sources, ensuring accuracy and reliability. This step helped in building 

a comprehensive understanding of the materiality of issues. The outcome of the double 

materiality assessment (DMA) was then used to prepare this report as much as possible 

in accordance with the guidelines set out in the CSRD.

from the auditors can be found on page 152.  

Aroundtown presents its performance measures in alignment with the European 

Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) sustainability Best Practice Recommendations 

(sBPR) standards throughout this report. Full estimation of value chain data, upstream 

and downstream, has not been conducted. Value chain data is only included for 

tenant-obtained energy consumption and water usage. Information regarding the 

preparation of the data throughout the report can be found in the EPRA sBPR Data 

Preparation section of this report. As well as EPRA sBPR, Aroundtown also reports 

in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and conducts Sustainability 

Accounting Standards Board (SASB) mapping, which are published in separate 

documents in our website. 

In preparation for the first compliance window of the EU’s Corporate Sustainability 

Reporting Directive (CSRD) in 2025, Aroundtown structured and prepared this 

report to be in alignment with the recommendations of the European Sustainability 

Reporting Standards (ESRS). This report also includes information published in 

compliance with the EU Taxonomy, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European 

Parliament.

The methodology used to prepare the Sustainability Statement is as below:

1. 

Identification of Stakeholders

The process began by identifying the stakeholders relevant to Aroundtown, which 

involved defining the purpose and scope of the Non-Financial Report and identifying 

captured stakeholders. Subsequently, the identified stakeholders’ perspectives were 

assessed, and relevant stakeholders were engaged further through a series of topical 

interviews.

company. On one front, it assesses the impact on the company itself, delving into 

financial health, operational efficiency, and employee well-being. Simultaneously, the 

assessment extends its gaze to the broader horizon, examining the company’s impact 

on people and the planet. This dual focus enables a comprehensive understanding of 

not only financial implications but also social responsibility, environmental impact, 

and the overall contribution to a sustainable and ethical future.

In 2023, Aroundtown undertook a review of its material topics as part of a 

comprehensive sustainability risk assessment under the direction of the Sustainability 

Department. As part of its ongoing commitment to sustainability and responsible 

business practices, it is critical to emphasize the importance of the DMA assessment 

for the development of the Group’s business. This assessment is not just a procedural 

4.  Scoring methodology was developed and implemented in order to make a final list 

of material topics that would be used for the disclosure and reporting.

Interviews and a digital survey played a crucial role in the DMA process, providing 

both a qualitative and quantitative dimension to the analysis. This approach 

ensured a comprehensive exploration of relevant subjects, allowing for a more 

in-depth understanding of the stakeholders’ perspectives and insights as well as 

their perspectives on ESG priorities and future areas of risk and opportunity for 

Aroundtown – all of which informs the Group’s strategy.

The result of the DMA is represented the materiality chart below. An analysis of

The DMA was performed in four stages: 

1.  Identification of ESG topics through the review of a list of GRI material topics, as 

well as sector-specific material topics.

2.  Prioritization of the topics in order to select a short list of material topics that were 

used for further investigation in the next steps of the process.

AROUNDTOWN’S ESG STRATEGY

Another  pillar of our ESG strategy is tenant satisfaction. Our tenants are pivotal to our 

Aroundtown’s  ESG  Strategy  is  guided  by  dedication  to  operating  responsibly, 

success, so we are committed to exceptional customer service, tailored management

approaches, and continuous improvement to foster long-term tenant relationships.

Our tenants have access to a 24/7 hotline for emergency support, and our residential

demonstrates our commitment to sustainable real estate. Overall, our approach and 

and  relevant  information  is  available.  Environmental  initiatives,  such  as  BREEAM

plans  include  further  digitalization,  service  enhancements,  and  a  focus  on  tenant 

Our  overarching  ESG  Strategy  is  detailed  throughout  this  report  and  has  been 

designed to focus on the ESG topics which have been identified as relevant to our 

business. As  a  result  of  our  2023  DMA,  we  have  implemented  several  changes  to 

ensure  material  impacts,  risks  and  opportunities  are  effectively  addressed.  Our 

Strategy is constantly evolving to meet the needs of our stakeholders and to remain 

aligned with legislation and regulation that apply to us.   

As  described  in  our  Strategy  and  Business  Model  section,  we  source  and  acquire 

assets that follow our selective acquisition criteria and benefit from internal growth 

potential, including assets that might be underperforming in terms of ESG aspects 

and can be refurbished and repositioned into quality assets. Our refurbishment-first 

approach  underpins  our  ESG  Strategy  as  we  recognize  the  benefits  of  renovating 

existing building stock rather than demolishing and developing new assets. By using 

this approach, we minimize construction waste during the development process as 

well  as  the  energy  consumption,  biodiversity  impacts  and  noise  pollution  which 

would occur during a full construction project. 

Raising  assets’  environmental  performance  is  one  of  our  main  sustainability 

drivers, and we therefore invest also in buildings with development potential from 

a  sustainability  perspective,  even  if  this  might  require  more  significant  structural 

interventions.  Fundamentally,  the  findings  of  the  environmental  assessments 

undertaken as part of our due diligence enable us to develop comprehensive asset 

environmental  improvement  plans,  including  a  defined  catalogue  of  measures 

which are factored into the budget for asset repositioning.

feedback to refine offerings, demonstrating a proactive, tenant-first approach that 

drives both operational excellence and tenant loyalty. Our Tenant Satisfaction Policy 

further  details  our  commitments  to  our  tenants  and  how  we  ensure  high-quality 

customer service. 

With regard to the satisfaction of its employees, Aroundtown continues to engage 

with them through various ways, providing training and professional development 

opportunities, as well as channeling their feedback to further shape Aroundtown as 

a welcoming and diverse company. We also closely monitor our gender pay gap in an 

effort to increase transparency and conform to widely accepted standards. 

Furthermore, our Business Partner Code of Conduct and our Human Rights Policy set 

out our commitments to act in accordance with internationally recognized standards 

of  human  rights  and  includes  our  expectations  of  our  suppliers  to  ensure  our 

value chain workers are protected to the same standards we hold ourselves. Both 

policies were updated in 2023. In general, Aroundtown’s corporate governance and 

compliance with the ever evolving regulatory and legal frameworks in the European 

Union have been of great importance to the Group and at the core of our business.

 ● Achieve a 20% reduction in energy intensity by 2030 against the 2019 baseline, 

measured in kWh/m2

Over recent years, from a global community standpoint, we have truly recognized 

the crucial role we play in mitigating the negative effects of climate change- the 

Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  has  made  it  clear  that  the 

international  community  must  limit  global  warming  to  +1.5°C  in  comparison 

to  pre-industrial  times.  Without  significant  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)

buildings and construction make up around 40% of annual global emissions, we are 

undertaking significant mitigation efforts to drive this transition. 

There  is  increasing  pressure  from  investors,  governments  and  regulators,  and 

society for urgent action to reduce the adverse impact of the built environment on 

climate change. A key development which continues to drive change is the phased 

introduction of the EU Taxonomy. This legislation requires large, listed companies 

like  Aroundtown  to  align  their  approach  with  strict  criteria  across  fundamental 

environmental objectives on climate change, water, waste, pollution, and biodiversity.

Aroundtown Group Carbon Reduction Strategy

Our fundamental commitment to climate change mitigation is our target of a 40% 
reduction in CO2 emissions intensity by 2030, against our 2019 baseline. In order to 
achieve this ambitious goal, we developed our Group-wide Environmental and Energy 

Policy,  to  establish  how  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  projects  will  be  targeted, 

identified, implemented and monitored. 

 ● Continue to implement climate change adaptation plans determined in 2022 and 2023

Guiding  our  actions  on  this  target  is  the  Group’s  CO2  Pathway,  which  monitors  our

Our Energy Strategy focuses on:

 ● Comprehensive due diligence at the acquisition stage including energy efficiency 
aspects, enabling us to develop asset improvement and refurbishment plans to 

achieve energy efficiency improvements 

 ● Implementation of environmental management policies and procedures, including 
data collection, digitalization and reporting, preventative maintenance and ongoing 

operational improvement

 ● Sustainable energy measures encompassing investment in solar and wind power 
systems, combined heat and power (CHP), electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, 

smart meters and a total energy management system

 ● Progressively switching all electricity from Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to 

PPA certified renewable energy by 2027

 ● Collaborating with tenants with whom we seek to implement green elements into 

lease agreements

integrated  picture  of  our  progress  towards  our  reduction  targets. The  outcome  of 

this project will guide our decision to proceed with a broader and more extensive 

implementation.  In  the  future,  we  will  enhance  these  assessments  with  further 

digital modelling to simulate the effect of efficiency interventions.

Whereas  our  initial  energy  management  approach  has  been  to  invest  in  onsite 

renewable energy and efficient energy generating systems such as CHPs, we adjusted 

our  approach  to  align  with  the  three-stage  hierarchy  in  the  World  Green  Building 

Council’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment for operational carbon. This means 

when identifying energy interventions, we first focus on ways to reduce and optimize 

the energy demand of our assets, then identify opportunities to generate the required 

energy renewably and onsite, and finally source the remaining energy demand through 

off-site  renewable  energy.  Note  that  given  the  regulatory  changes  in  the  past year, 

particularly regarding the usage of gas or fuel-based systems, such as CHPs, we will 

likely phase out CHPs in the mid-term.

To ensure we prioritize these improvement plans correctly and monitor their effect

Investments into Renewable and Efficient Energy Systems 

The  gradual  global  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  has  highlighted  the

Over the years, our investments have focused on the following measures:

and  information;  observance  of  energy  conservation  practices;  selection  of  low 

energy-consuming equipment and preference to renewable-based energy. 

 ● The installation and operation of solar PV generation systems on rooftops and 

parking areas

Internal Carbon Pricing

 ● The installation of highly efficient energy generating systems based on CHP

We have applied an internal carbon price so we can identify the additional benefits 

 ● The installation of EVs, charging stations. This allows for conversion of both the 
tenants’ vehicles and the Group’s fleet to EVs, resulting in lower fleet cost and more 

reliable mobility as well as lower emissions

Together  with  a  partner  company,  we  implement  efficient  and  renewable-based 

onsite  energy  systems  at  our  properties.  Our  partner  also  undertakes  site  visits 

to identify the number of EV charging points that can be installed at each of our

the German pricing based on the Fuel Emissions Trading Act2 as opposed to the wider 
market pricing. This pricing was €30/ton CO2 through 2023, is set at €45/ton CO2 for 
2024, and will increase incrementally to a price corridor of €55-65/ton CO2 by 2026. 
From 2027 onward, it will transition to a market-based system for which the rules are

The Management of Aroundtown is co-responsible for assessing and managing climate-related risks. 

A  distinction  is  made  between  climate  risks  affecting  the  Group  at  the  corporate  level,  for  which 

Management is the risk owner, and climate risks which impact our properties, which are owned by the 

Operations Department. In addition, our Taskforce on Building Resilience works cross-departmentally to 

address climate risks across relevant business units, developing action plans and adaptation solutions 

as necessary.

Strategy

In order to effectively manage climate-related risks, we firstly conduct risk assessments 

to  understand  the  impacts  these  risks  could  have.  The  Risk  Committee  oversees 

risk  management  for  the  Group,  and  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  are 

considered as part of this process. Assessment of physical and transitional climate 

risks  is  conducted  by  the  Chief  Risk  Officer  (CRO)  in  close  collaboration  with  the 

Sustainability Department, and such assessments are presented to the Committee 

annually  at  a  minimum,  as  well  as  upon  urgency  throughout  the  year.  Following 

these assessments, we determine relevant and practicable measures to help reduce 

risks and maximize potential opportunities.

Transition Risk

In order to understand the exposure of the Group to transition risks, the Sustainability 

Department and Risk Committee have undertaken a comprehensive assessment of 

various transitional risk factors. A summary of the identified risks is provided in the 

following table, which also sets out the mitigation strategies being used to control 

these risks in our organization. In alignment with the recommendations of the TCFD, 

we also describe the potential opportunities which the Group has identified in each 

of these factors.

The  timeframes  short-,  medium-  and  long-term  in  this  table  refer  to  expectations 

in  the  next  1-3  years,  4-10  years,  and  10+  years  respectively. We  have  started  the 

process of financially quantifying climate-related physical and transition risk and will 

continue to bolster these processes and our sources of information through 2024.

A move to more efficient buildings may result 
in  lower  operating  costs,  reduce  stranding 
risks  and  decrease  exposure  to  variations  in 
the  cost  and  availability  of  natural  resources. 
More  efficient  buildings  may  also  attract  hig-
her  valuations  influenced  by  improved  energy 
performance and will be more attractive to in-
vestors,  tenants  and  financial  institutions  due 
to compliance with their sustainable reporting 
requirements.

Climate-related regulations and laws are chan-
ging rapidly, placing stricter requirements and 
expectations on the energy and emissions per-
formance. Carbon pricing schemes and energy 
ratings  such  as  the  EU‘s  energy  performance 
certificates (EPCs) are increasingly being imple-
mented, and requirements for minimum ratings 
that must be met to let units to tenants are co-
ming into force. Over time, existing regulations 
may  become  more  aggressive  or  new  policy 
tools may be implemented posing restrictions 
on  letting  or  preventing  the  sale  of  buildings 
that  do  not  comply  with  such  minimum  stan-
dards, leaving them „stranded“.

Carbon pricing and enhanced emissions-repor-
ting  obligations  might  result  in  higher  opera-
ting  and  compliance  costs.  Stricter  EPC  requi-
rements  are  already  in  place  in  Netherlands 
and are set to be implemented throughout EU 
member states with the recasting of the Energy 
Performance  of  Buildings  Directive  (EPBD)  in 
2023 -  a  trend  expected  to  continue  over  the 
mid  to  long-term. These  standards  may  requi-
re  increased  CapEx  to  bring  properties  up  to 
the required standard in order to prevent their 
stranding. Market and investor pressure to disc-
lose GHG emissions, as well as a carbon reduc-
tion pathway to net-zero has increased and will 
stay high in the mid to long-term.

(S, M, L)

Companies may also become subject to lawsu-
its alleging failure to take sufficient actions to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to account 
for  or  disclose  known  climate-related  risks. 
Climate-related litigation may also result from 
erroneous  non-financial  reporting  or  mislea-
ding  sustainability  claims,  in  cases  of „green-
washing,“ while companies in the EU found to 
have  made  misleading  or  false  environmen-
tal claims could face fines if the proposed EU 
Green Claims Directive is approved.

With  stricter  EU  regulation,  including  the  EU 
Taxonomy  and  SFDR,  the  real  estate  sector 
has  already  felt  the  pressure  of  environmen-
tal  legislation.  The  significant  gaps  between 
current regulations and the carbon budgets of 
the  Paris Agreement  make  further  regulatory 
tightening over the mid- to long-term likely. It 
is also possible that the scope of these regu-
lations  expands  to  take  in  more  segments  of 
the  Group‘s  value  chain,  increasing  potential 
exposure  and  compliance  costs.  While  clima-
te-related litigation has primarily targeted go-
vernments  and  fossil  fuel  companies  to  date, 
it  is  possible  that  other  sectors  such  as  real 
estate  may  be  targeted  over  the  medium-to-
long term.

The  Group‘s  Carbon  Reduction  Pathway  forms 
the strategy for reducing the carbon intensity of 
the portfolio. The Pathway explicitly considers 
potential  carbon  taxes  and  energy  efficiency 
measures  and  will  identify  inefficient  assets 
which  are  high  priority  for  action  to  mitigate 
stranding risk. The Group has piloted the use of 
the science-based CRREM methodology across 
the  Dutch  portfolio  to  assess  the  medium-/
long-term alignment of our assets to decarbo-
nization expectations. The Group has also laun-
ched  a  broader  CRREM  analysis  starting  with 
a set of assets in the German portfolio. These 
results  have  been  used  to  inform  the  overall 
strategy,  although  at  this  time,  the  Group  has 
prioritized stranding definitions based on EPCs 
and  the  EU’s  climate  commitments  embodied 
in  the  EPBD  recast,  which  provides  a  more 
straightforward guide for prioritizing inefficient 
assets for improvement and for the renovation 
planning  process  itself,  although  some  uncer-
tainty  remains  regarding  implementation  at 
the national level.

Our dedicated Sustainability Department works 
to ensure accurate and high-quality non-finan-
cial  reporting,  while  constantly  monitoring 
changes  in  regulations  to  identify  gaps  and 
facilitate  compliance.    This  involves  not  only 
monitoring  current  legislative  initiatives  but 
also assessing the gaps between current policy 
and science-based climate targets to anticipate 
future changes.

Tenant  preferences  for  low  or  zero-carbon 
properties are likely to reduce demand for in-
efficient  properties.  Likewise,  shifting  investor 
preferences for sustainable and resilient assets 
could  see  valuations  favor  green  buildings. 
Market conditions may shift from “green premi-
ums”  for  low-  or zero-carbon  assets  to “brown 
discounts”  in  rent  or valuation  for  assets  with 
high energy or carbon intensities.

Energy markets are more prone to price fluc-
tuations driven by supply crunches or swings 
in  energy  demand.  This  leads  to  risks  asso-
ciated with high energy and utility consump-
tion  and  over-reliance  on  fossil-fuel  derived 
energy supplies.

Market

Energy

The  age  of  German  building  stock,  where  the 
Group  primarily  operates,  combined  with  our 
business model of acquiring and  managing ex-
isting buildings, poses significant challenges in 
offering low or zero-carbon properties through 
the level of investment that is required. Inabili-
ty to meet tenant preferences may increase va-
cancies and reduce revenues while inability to 
meet market expectations may reduce access to 
capital. Shifting market demand may put down-
ward  pressure  on  the  value  of “brown”  assets 
which are not in line with market expectations, 
thereby reducing the availability of capital and 
increasing  the  cost  of  debt.  Increasing  sus-
tainable  finance  regulation  is  forcing  tenants 
and  investors  to  report  on  their  sustainable 
actions, which will increase these demands on 
the Group. The existing market structure leaves 
landlords  responsible  for  capital  expenditures 
needed to improve energy efficiency of existing 
assets  with  limited  ability  to  recover  reduced 
utility expenses enjoyed by the tenant.

(M, L)

Energy  market  risks  associated  with  a  depen-
dence  on  fossil  fuels  were  previously  seen  as 
being  relevant  in  the  medium-to-long  term, 
but the Russian war in Ukraine and the ensu-
ing  rise  in  energy  prices  have  brought  these 
risks to the present day. This has caused many 
sectors, including the real estate sector to call 
for speeding up the transition to a low-carbon 
economy. Nonetheless, the current energy mix 
of most grids are still primarily reliant on fos-
sil  fuels,  as  renewable  energy  generation  and 
energy storage capacities have not reached the 
required levels for decarbonization.

(S, M, L)

The  Group  is  working  with  tenants  to  reduce 
energy and utility consumption as part of speci-
fic green lease agreements and tenant awaren-
ess  campaigns,  as  well  as  increasing  engage-
ment with our tenants on their green building 
expectations and needs. 

The  Group  is  working  on  collaboration  and 
cost-sharing  arrangements  with  tenants  in 
the  area  of  energy-efficiency-improving  reno-
vations  to  mitigate  risks  posed  by  the  current 
market structure. 

The  carbon  reduction  pathway  prioritizes  the 
most  inefficient  assets  in  the  portfolio  for  as-
sessment of possible interventions to determi-
ne economic feasibility of investments that will 
protect  or  improve  their  value.  This  pathway 
will be subject to ongoing development to en-
sure alignment to market standards.

Aroundtown’s scale provides economic benefits 
which  result  in  competitive  advantages  in  re-
positioning assets with development potential 
in  terms  of  energy  efficiency  or  climate  resi-
lience. This  could  result  in  growth  opportuni-
ties through the acquisition of such assets from 
owners without such ability. 

Low  and  zero-carbon  buildings  will  be  better 
positioned  to  reflect  shifting  tenant  preferen-
ces,  as  well  as  investor  demands,  positively 
impacting  rents  and  access  to  capital.  Green 
assets  may  strengthen  business  resilience  by 
increasing revenue through new products and 
services  that  meet  market  demands  and  may 
improve access to capital and debt. Green bond 
issuance,  sustainability-linked  loans  or  energy 
efficiency-related  subsidies  for  buildings  can 
be  used  to  improve  the  financial  feasibility  of 
making the needed investments.

The  Group  aims  to  reduce  reliance  on  fossil 
fuels  through  its  target  to  procure  100%  of 
landlord-obtained  electricity  through  power 
purchase agreements (PPAs), as well as through 
installation  of  onsite  renewable  energy  sys-
tems. Investments in energy efficiency will also 
reduce energy costs, mitigating exposure to va-
riations in price. 

Increasing  procurement  of  energy  from  re-
newable  sources  and  a  shift  to  decentralized 
energy  generation  can  reduce  operational 
costs,  compliance  costs  and  exposure  to vola-
tile  fossil  fuel  markets.  Green  bond  issuance 
or  sustainability-linked  loans  can  be  used  to 
improve the financial feasibility of making the 
needed investments.

Variation under Climate Scenarios

Variation by Location

Deadly  heat  stress  is  a  prominent  risk  across 
our countries of operation, particularly in urban 
areas with heat island effects. Other potential 
chronic  impacts  include  worsening  air  quality 
due to wildfires, and the spread of disease vec-
tors due to increased temperatures. 

Extreme 
Heat

Under-adapted assets could become dangerous 
or unlivable in situations of extreme heat, with 
potential  effects  on  occupancy  or  rent  levels. 
Household  energy  demand  is  likely  to  increa-
se to manage extreme temperatures. Increased 
CapEx  demands  will  be  incurred  to  adapt  to 
these risks with measures such as green roof-
tops or use of water permeable material.

Divergence in degree of exposure between sce-
narios is only observed in the latter half of the 
century. With actual extreme heat observations 
outpacing  modelled  estimates  of  our  current 
warming  path,  our  analysis  indicates  this  risk 
is  highly  likely  to  become  material,  regardless 
of scenario.

Likely  to  be  experienced  at  similar  levels 
throughout  given  urban  geographies,  indica-
ting the need for systemic adaptation plans in 
high-risk  locations.  Munich  has  a  high  rate  of 
increase of exposure, as well as high absolute 
risk, alongside other South German cities such 
as Stuttgart.

Decreased  precipitation  and  increased  tem-
peratures,  particularly  during  extreme  heat 
events,  could  make  water  scarce  across  large 
geographic  areas. This  may  have  wider  infras-
tructural effects, including to local agriculture.

Under-adapted assets could become dangerous 
or unlivable in drought conditions, with poten-
tial effects on occupancy or rent levels. CapEx 
requirements  may  be  required  to  adapt  high 
risk assets.

Divergence of risk level between the scenarios 
analyzed is comparatively lower than for other 
risks, with the level of exposure of the Group's 
regions  of  operation  high  across  all  warming 
paths assessed.

Wildfire  events  can  cause  substantial  damage 
to  life  and  property  in  short  periods  of  time, 
displacing  communities  and  rendering  wider 
areas  dangerous  or  unlivable.  The  resulting 
smoke also severely worsens air quality, leading 
to potential chronic impacts.

Acute  property  damage  could  prove  highly 
costly  to  the  business  and  dangerous  to  our 
occupants.  The  potential  chronic  impacts  on 
air quality may also impact occupancy.  Height-
ened physical risk is also likely to impact insu-
rance premiums and vacancy rates.

analyzed is comparatively lower than for other 
risks, with the level of exposure of the Group's 
regions  of  operation  high  across  all  warming 
paths assessed.

Spontaneous flooding due to extreme precipi-
tation can cause substantial damage, with the 
impacts depending strongly on location due to 
ground conditions and structural stability. Such 
flooding can also have collateral impacts on in-
frastructure and transportation.

Acute  property  damage  could  prove  highly 
costly  to  the  business  and  dangerous  to  our 
occupants.  Impacts  are  extremely  dependent 
on  asset-level  conditions,  making  it  difficult 
to  assess  the  value  at  risk  with  any  accuracy. 
Heightened physical risk is also likely to impact 
insurance premiums and vacancy rates.

Some cities see considerable differences in risk 
scores between the SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 sce-
narios, with greater magnitude of increase bet-
ween decades observed in the higher-warming 
scenario. The  rate  of  increase  of  risk  rating  is 
most  pronounced  in  the  decades  before  2050 
in these more severe scenarios.

Drought

Wildfire

Fluvial 
Flood

Rising  sea  levels  may  render  coastal  areas  or 
river  flood  basins  unlivable.  Impacts  will  be 
widespread  in  affected  locations,  potentially 
leading  to  displacement  of  communities  or 
substantial adaptation costs.

Coastal 
Flood

Surface  water  or  river  flooding  could  lead  to 
severe  damage  to  real  estate,  potentially  in-
curring  substantial  costs  for  repair  and  main-
tenance, and losses from assets being removed 
from operation. Heightened physical risk is also 
likely  to  impact  insurance  premiums  and  va-
cancy rates.

Differences  between  scenarios  are  significant 
by the end of the century, but are less pronoun-
ced  through  to  2050,  suggesting  this  risk  will 
be material regardless of actual warming.

Drought risks are observed to be correlated by 
region, with the East German cities of Leipzig, 
Halle,  and  Dresden  among  the  most  exposed. 
Almost all cities have near-maximum exposu-
re scores by the end of the century, indicating 
that the solutions adopted need to be systemic 
across locations.

Local geographical conditions drive wide varia-
tions in exposure levels between cities. Despite 
the connection to heat and precipitation levels, 
the  results  differ  from  the  scores  for  extreme 
heat  and  drought,  indicating  a  need  to  assess 
local risk drivers at asset-level.

There are considerable differences in exposure 
scores  at  city  level,  indicating  the  very  locati-
on-specific  drivers  of  this  risk. The  cities  with 
greatest  exposure  include  London,  Hamburg 
and  Amsterdam.    London  also  ranks  among 
the cities with the greatest rate of increase in 
exposure  through  2050,  along  with  the  cities 
of Frankfurt, Mannheim, Mainz, and Wiesbaden, 
which  are  located  near  the  confluence  of  the 
Rhein and Main rivers.  The highly location de-
pendent findings demonstrate the need to con-
duct asset-level assessments of this risk.

Naturally, this risk can only be assessed in co-
astal  cities,  with  the  highest  scores  found  in 
Bremen, Amsterdam and Hamburg. As the adap-
tation solutions required cannot be implemen-
ted at the scope of individual assets, in-depth 
consideration of the adaptation plans of local 
governments  will  be  required  to  understand 
the value at risk of assets.

With  climate  change  being  felt  across  our  countries  of  operations,  it  is  Aroundtown’s 

goal  to  increase  the  long-term  resilience  of  its  portfolio  against  climate-related  risks. 

With the selection of a climate risk assessment tool at the end of 2023, Aroundtown is 

well-equipped to expand its portfolio-level risk assessment to an in-depth, asset-specific 

analysis in 2024. This will allow the development of more tailored adaptation solutions 

for our individual assets, which will be implemented in subsequent years.

Following the common practice of distinguishing climate-related risks into physical and

transition risks, we further subdivide physical risks as being either chronic or acute, with 

regards to the timescale of their impacts, and as being temperature-, wind-, water- or solid 

mass-related, as laid out in the EU Taxonomy. 

In order to assess and monitor the progress towards our climate change-related goals and 

commitments, we regularly collect utility consumption data from our assets as shown in 

tables 1 and 2. This also allows us to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions associated

the portfolio (see section on Physical Climate Risk Assessment), the taskforce developed 

several adaptation solutions to counter these risks and to make AT’s assets more resilient 

in the long run. In order to prioritize these measures, the Building Resilience Taskforce 

held  a  working  session  to  assess  the  materiality  and  feasibility  to  the  stakeholder

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

Within Aroundtown’s overarching goal of environmental protection, we include other 

Circular Economy

closely  associated  topics  that  were  raised  in  our  2023  DMA  but  were  not  deemed 

material:  resource  use  and  circular  economy,  water  management,  biodiversity  and 

ecosystems, and pollution. All these matters align with our long-term commitment to

While the circular economy topic was not deemed material during our DMA, we do 

address the transition to a circular economy in our EU Taxonomy analysis. In order 

to establish quantitative targets for waste reduction and improved recycling rates, 

we must first gather an accurate baseline of data across our assets. This will be a key

2024 Goals

Tenant Waste Management

 ● Engage more closely with our contractors regarding the recycling of demolition waste 

To increase recycling rates, we are providing waste separation facilities on our sites, 

 ● Improve data gathering on waste disposal and recycling rates by further rolling 
out our framework agreement with an established waste management company 
for most of our portfolio

and engaging with our tenants on their waste management practices. As with other 

sustainable measures, reductions in waste output and landfill volume correspond to 

reductions in operating costs, alongside reducing our environmental impact.

 ● Conduct biodiversity projects across our assets to help understand improvement 

opportunities

 ● Expand smart water metering initiative into German assets

Whereas  some  portfolio  sectors  have  traditionally  posed  a  greater  challenge  to 

influencing waste management practices, such as residential or hotels, others have been 

easier to influence, such as offices. However, as sustainability issues rise on everyone’s 

agenda, we are beginning to see engagement on environmental issues from most of our 

tenants.  Our local technical teams are always available to support tenants who seek our 

advice on these issues. This coordination and engagement between stakeholders will be 

a crucial part of building a more circular, resource-efficient economy.

These systems are yet to prove effective in inciting meaningful behavioral changes,

the actual volume of waste disposed, so extending this initiative to further assets 

is not to be expected. 

In  order  to  track  the  progress  of  our  approach,  we  collect  waste  generation  data 

from our assets and monitor this year on year, as will be presented in April. Due to 

restrictions around tenant data sharing, we include tenant waste generation within 

our landlord-managed figures. It is only possible, based on our waste collectors, to 

report recycled and non-recycled waste.

In 2023, we continued to conduct biodiversity studies at our sites to assess the types 

and extent of species we have onsite and to identify opportunities for biodiversity 

enhancement  on  and  around  our  assets.  In  Germany,  as  part  of  our  employee 

engagement  program,  ‘Activate  the  Base’,  some  colleagues  formed  a  biodiversity 

taskforce  aiming  to  kick-off  the  biodiversity  studies  in  Germany  after  they  were 

piloted  in  the  Netherlands  in  2022.  Four  assets  were  assessed  in  Berlin  in  2023, 

for which implementation projects of the identified improvement measures will be 

rolled out in 2024.  

Meanwhile,  our  Dutch  operations  conducted  17  biodiversity  studies  across  eight 

cities,  compared  to  seven  studies  conducted  in  2022.  Following  the  results,  and 

carefully  considering  both  the  urban  landscape  of  the  corresponding  assets  and 

the  practical  feasibility  of  the  identified  possible  measures,  three  biodiversity 

enhancement projects took place in the Netherlands in 2023. These included the 

installation  of  bat,  hedgehog,  squirrel  and  bird  houses,  insect  hotels,  green  roofs, 

and the planting of local flora and fauna. For 2024, further biodiversity studies have 

already been planned for the Netherlands.

Finally, we continued to expand our ‘Aroundtown buzzes’ program to protect urban 

bee populations in and around our assets. The program was initiated in 2020 with 

15  rooftop  beehives  across  our  commercial  properties.  By  2023,  we  had  43  bee 

colonies across 11 roofs in our portfolio. These also include four roofs in our hotel 

portfolio which we added to this program, in collaboration with the hotel tenants. 

The bees are looked after by our very own registered beekeeper.

In  addition,  to  further  engage  our  staff  with  these  biodiversity  programs,  our

EU TAXONOMY

Introduction

The  EU  Taxonomy  is  a  classification  system  for  the  identification  of  sustainable 

economic  activities  established  by  the  European  Commission.  Its  purpose  is  to 

offer companies, investors and policymakers a standard set of definitions for which 

economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable in order to create 

security  for  investors,  protect  against  greenwashing  and  encourage  investment 

into  more  sustainable  activities.  The  EU  Taxonomy  is  currently  comprised  of  six 

environmental objectives: Climate Change Mitigation; Climate Change Adaptation; 

Sustainable Use and Protection of Water and Marine Resources; Transition to Circular 

Economy; Pollution Prevention and Control; and the Protection and Restoration of 

Biodiversity and Ecosystems. The technical screening criteria for the six EU Taxonomy 

environmental  objectives  were  scheduled  for  release  over  a  multiyear  timeframe. 

The Climate Delegated Act covering the technical screening criteria for a substantial 

contribution to Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change Adaptation and the 

Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria for the remaining environmental objectives 

was  approved  in  2021  and  applied  as  of  January  2022.  The  final  Environmental 

and  its  reporting  requirements,  several  training  sessions  were  conducted  with  the 

Construction  and  Operation  Departments  in  Germany,  as  well  as  the  Netherlands, 

Greece  and  Cyprus  throughout  2023.  At  Aroundtown,  the  standard  construction 

contract was also recently revised to ensure the accessibility of information necessary 

for EU Taxonomy compliance, incorporating provisions for contractors to deliver data 

pertinent to EU Taxonomy reporting. The updated contract includes the EU Taxonomy 

pollution  prevention  questionnaire  (to  be  signed  by  contractors)  which  covers  the 

DNSH criteria on Pollution Prevention and Control, and integrates explicit provisions 

for  waste  disposal  and  recycling  data,  covering  the  Circular  Economy  requirements 

under  the  DNSH  criteria  for  Climate  Change  Mitigation.  It  also  covers  the  DNSH 

technical specifications for water appliances so that in the future all refurbishment 

activities that affect water appliances must align – if economically possible – to the 

specifications of the EU Taxonomy. The new contract has taken effect from January 

2024 for Aroundtown, while GCP is currently undertaking the contract update check, 

which is also expected to be rolled out during 2024.

Methodology

Approach Taken to Determine Taxonomy-Eligible Activities

In order to determine EU Taxonomy eligibility,  Aroundtown first identified all activities 

undertaken by the Group during an initial assessment conducted in 2021 involving 

multiple  departments.  Subsequently,  the  Sustainability  Department  has  reviewed 

remaining environmental objectives - Sustainable Use and Protection of Water and 

Marine Resources; Transition to Circular Economy; Pollution Prevention and Control; 

and the Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity and Ecosystems – in June 2023, 

clarified that only Circular Economy provided additional economic activities for the 

real estate and construction sector. These new activities are:

the activities to determine whether the list was still up to date. In 2022, we changed 

 ● Construction of new buildings (3.1)

our reporting of photovoltaic systems, which were previously reported under activity 

 ● Renovation of existing buildings (3.2)

4.1 (electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology) to reporting under 

activity  7.6  (installation,  maintenance  and  repair  of  renewable  energy  systems) 

following further clarification published by the European Commission in December 

2022. In 2023, Aroundtown continued to follow the established methodology.

 ● Demolition and wrecking of buildings and other structures (3.3)

 ● Maintenance of roads and motorways (3.4)

 ● Use of concrete in civil engineering (3.5)

Hence,  the  following  seven  EU  Taxonomy-eligible  activities  were  determined  as 

Of these activities, only 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 apply to Aroundtown and are considered as

 ● Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, 

regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings (7.5)

 ● Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy systems (7.6)

 ● Acquisition and ownership of buildings (7.7). 

Despite the activities’ contribution to both objectives, Aroundtown considers itself 

with suppliers to provide better recycling data, which has already been added as a 

data delivery requirement to Aroundtown’s construction contract template in 2023. 

Attributing Data to Economic Activities

Although  our  Construction  and  Operations  Departments  started  to  put  into  place 

processes in 2022 that allow for the allocation of projects or activities to the relevant 

economic  activities,  the  majority  of  invoices  had  to  be  analyzed  and  evaluated 

as contributing more to Climate Change Mitigation than Climate Change Adaptation

Assessment of Aligned Activities

For an economic activity to be aligned with the EU Taxonomy, three requirements 

need to be fulfilled:

1.  

it must make a substantial contribution to the achievement of one or more EU 

environmental objectives (“substantial contribution”)

2.  

it  does  not  significantly  harm  any  other  EU  environmental  objective  (“do  no 

significant harm / DNSH”)

3.  

it is in compliance with minimum social standards on topics such as Human 

Rights, Labor Standards and Anti-Corruption (“minimum social safeguards”)

Germany has created an issue for reporting. Aroundtown closely follows the sector’s 

debate on the topic and has reviewed and assessed several methodologies presented 

by industry organizations and an external service provider to the real estate sector. 

After thorough review of the available methodologies, Aroundtown has adopted the 

15%  benchmark  approach  based  on  data  published  by  a  publicly  available  index, 

that  has  been  endorsed  by  the  German  Sustainable  Building  Council  (DGNB),  a 

non-profit focused on making buildings more sustainable. The index uses average 

yearly  primary  energy  consumption  data  per  asset  type  from  its vast  database  of 

European clients’ consumption data to establish top 15% and top 30% benchmarks 

for Germany, the UK, Benelux and other countries. We note that this approach was 

adopted for the German portfolio only, whereas for the Dutch and London portfolios

business levels at Aroundtown. Whereas substantial contribution to Climate Change 

Mitigation  is  assessed  at  the  individual  asset  or  project  level,  the  DNSH  criteria 

apply rather to the economic activity itself. The DNSH criteria for Climate Change 

Adaptation and Circular Economy was conducted for Aroundtown as a whole. 

Hence, aligned turnover and OpEx was only calculated in relation to the properties 

that  fall  within  the  top  15%  of  building  stock  (German  portfolio)  or  have  an  EPC 

rating  A  and  above  (Dutch  and  UK  portfolio).  However,  due  to  issues  with  data

CapEx   was considered as meeting the substantial contribution criteria. If this was 

not the case, the CapEx was assessed under for the business activity for individual 

energy efficiency measures as described in 7.3 (Installation, maintenance and repair 

of  energy  efficient  equipment).  Depending  on  the  individual  measure  that  was 

conducted,  compliance  with  the  relevant  technical  criteria  laid  out  in  the  GEG  or 

other national legislation is evaluated. Only if these were met, CapEx allocated to 7.3 

(Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficient equipment) is considered as 

meeting the substantial contribution criteria.

There  are  no  additional  technical  screening  criteria  for  activities  7.4  (Installation, 

maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and 

parking  spaces  attached  to  buildings)),  7.5  (Installation,  maintenance  and  repair 

of  instruments  and  devices  for  measuring,  regulation  and  controlling  energy 

performance of buildings) and 7.6 (Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable 

energy systems) beyond the list of individual measures described for each activity.

Do No Significant Harm Assessments

As mentioned above, in order for an economic activity to be aligned, the EU Taxonomy 

Regarding  activity  7.2  (Renovation  of  existing  buildings),  substantial  contribution 

criteria  to  Climate  Change  Mitigation  were  met,  however,  not  all  DNSH  could  be 

fulfilled, in particular the criteria for Protection of Water and Marine Resources. This 

stems  to  a  great  degree  from  a  lack  of  relevant  data  available  for  both  areas – 

areas in which Aroundtown Group is highly dependent on information provided by 

contractors and suppliers. The Group mainly faced challenges regarding the lack of 

readily available technical information of bathroom and kitchen appliances, which 

is oftentimes not indicated in contracts or invoices by contractors. 

Despite  these  challenges,  Aroundtown  has  worked  consistently  on  setting  up 

processes and gathering the necessary data for relevant DNSH criteria, in particular 

those for the environmental objectives of Protection of Water and Marine Resources. 

Aroundtown  is  committed  to  improving  access  to  data  relevant  for  EU Taxonomy 

reporting through continued engagement with contractors and suppliers. We note 

that this DNSH criteria does not apply to residential properties and can therefore be 

omitted in alignment checks of our residential portfolio held by our subsidiary GCP.

The other DNSH criteria related to the environmental objectives of Climate Change 

Adaptation, Circular Economy, and Pollution Prevention were met for 7.2 (Renovation 

of  existing  buildings),  the  assessments  of  which  are  described  further  below.  We 

note that the activity 7.2 (Renovation of existing buildings) can only be reported as

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report76

 ● Climate Change Adaptation: All economic activities in category 7 (construction 
and real estate), require that a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment 
is conducted following the steps laid out in Appendix A of the Delegated Act.4 
Please refer to the section on Climate Change Adaptation in this report for further 
information on this assessment and the adoption of relevant adaptation solutions. 

 ● Protection of Water and Marine Resources: Water appliances for bathrooms and 
kitchens need to follow specifications on maximum water flow and flush volume 
outlined in Appendix E of the EU Taxonomy Regulation5. As this DNSH is not fulfilled 
for 7.2 (Renovation of existing buildings) for AT in 2023 due to lack of data on 
installed appliances, the activity is only reported as aligned for our residential 
portfolio GCP, for which this DNSH does not apply. 

 ● Transition to a Circular Economy: At least 70% by weight of non-hazardous 
construction and demolition waste generated on the construction site are prepared 
for reuse, recycling and other material recovery. Aroundtown complies with national 
legislation on recycling requirements, and so do its renovation projects in Germany. 
The German Circular Economy Act Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz (KrWG), which implements 
EU Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, as well as its amending Directive 2018/851/EU6 
stipulates a recycling rate of 70% by weight for construction and demolition waste.   

 ● Pollution Prevention and Control: In order to prevent pollution through toxic and 
environmentally harming chemicals, non-financial undertakings are required to 
confirm that a number of chemical substances mentioned in Appendix C of the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation7 are not manufactured, placed on the market or being used 
in any economic activity. As this DNSH criteria is relevant for three of our economic 
activities – 7.1 (Construction of new buildings), 7.2 (Renovation of existing buildings) 
and 7.3 (Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficient equipment) – the 
Group has created a questionnaire outlining the specifications of Appendix C which 
has been sent to our largest contractors to confirm non-usage of these chemicals 
in our building materials and at our construction sites. It has been made clear in 
the European Commission’s FAQ document from December 20228 that such proof 
must come from the supplier itself.

Minimum Social Safeguards

The EU Taxonomy states that activities may not qualify as environmentally sustainable 
unless they comply with minimum social safeguards. This requires alignment with 
the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles 
on  Business  and  Human  Rights,  as  well  as  the  fundamental  conventions  of  the 
International Labor Organization (ILO) and the International Bill of Human Rights.

Aroundtown  has  several  corporate  policies  in  place  that  refer  to  these  international 
standards and frameworks to ensure alignment with these social minimum safeguards. 
These policies include our Human Rights Policy, the Business Partner Code of Conduct 
and Employee Code of Conduct, as well as the Anti-Corruption Policy. Further, the Group’s 
compliance trainings for employees include topics of corruption and fair business.

To assess the alignment of this framework to the required minimum safeguards, in 
particular on the topic of human rights, the Group has made reference to the report 
of the Platform on Sustainable Finance9 of October 2022, in which two criteria to 
determine compliance with the safeguards were established. These are:

1.   That the company has established adequate human rights due diligence (HRDD) 

processes,  as  outlined  in  the  UNGPs  and  OECD  Guidelines  for  Multi-national 

Enterprises (MNE).

2.   That there are no indications that the company does not adequately implement 

HRDD, resulting in human rights abuses.

Demonstrating adequate HRDD for the purposes of the first criterion requires that 
the following six key steps have been implemented:

Six-Steps of Human Rights Due Diligence

6.

Adopting and embedding a commitment to Human Rights Due Diligence into 
policies and procedures

Identification and assessment of adverse impacts, including through stakeholder 
engagement

Taking actions to cease, prevent, mitigate and remediate adverse impacts

Tracking the implementation of these actions and its results

Communicating publicly on the approach of HRDD and actions taken to avoid and 
address adverse impacts

Providing or cooperating in remediation, incl. establishing or participating in 
grievance mechanisms where individuals and groups  
can raise concerns about adverse impacts

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report77

Aroundtown has addressed and implemented these six steps through embedding 

published  on  6  July  2021  and  updated  by  Commission  Delegated  Regulation 

the  topic  of  Human  Rights  in  its  policies,  including  the  Human  Rights  Policy,  as

of information. Besides our desk-based due diligence checks, our construction and 

operation  managers  are  fulfilling  their  legal  monitoring  obligation  during  the 

execution of the project according to the national law of the project location. Finally, 

through Aroundtown’s whistle-blowing system that is accessible to employees and 

externals, potential human rights violations may be reported. 

Any reports are tracked and investigated by our Compliance Department. Following 

an internal investigation procedure as documented in our Investigation Policy for 

handling  potential  violations,  employees  or  business  partners  receive  a  warning, 

are fined, or banned from doing further business with the Group, should the claim 

be confirmed. Aroundtown may also decide to consult with authorities if necessary.

Please  also  see  the  section  ‘Fair  Business  and  Compliance’  and  the  subsection 

‘Management of Supplier Relationships’ in the Governance part of this report, which 

provide  further  information  on  compliance  with  social  minimum  safeguards  on 

corruption and fair business. 

None of the negative indicators described by the Platform on Sustainable Finance 

report  with  regard  to  human  rights,  corruption,  fair  business  and  taxation  for 

the  second  criterion  are  applicable  to  AT.  We  therefore  assess  that  this  criterion 

The definition of the Turnover KPI pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation:

Numerator

Share of turnover derived from products and services associated 
with EU Taxonomy-aligned activities.

Denominator

Total net turnover, calculated in accordance with “IAS 1.82 a) 
Revenue” and consistent with the accounting principles applied 
to the preparation of the Group’s financial statement. 

Please see the consolidated financial statements starting page 
158 of this report.

The only activity from which revenue is derived that is deemed to be EU Taxonomy-

eligible  is  activity  7.7  (Acquisition  and  ownership  of  buildings).  Aroundtown’s 

turnover consists to a great degree of revenue generated from rental income and 

operating income. The Group also derives a comparatively small amount of other 

income that is not related to eligible economic activities, which is not counted in 

the numerator but is included in the denominator. Other revenue includes mainly 

management fee, consulting fees as well as income from loans in connection with

implemented as required by Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy.

Calculation of Key Performance Indicators

Aroundtown’s denominator is taken from “revenue” from the Consolidated Statement 

of Profit or Loss.

Based on the determination above of EU Taxonomy-eligible activities, Aroundtown 
calculated the proportions of eligible and non-eligible activities, and the proportion 
of  these  eligible  activities  which  is  aligned,  in  accordance  with  the  calculation 
methodologies  defined  in  the  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  2021/2178 

Aligned  turnover  is  calculated  as  the  sum  of  turnover  generated  firstly,  from 

Aroundtown  Group’s  properties  that  fall  within  the  15%  top  building  stock  in 

Germany based on the previously described method and index and secondly, from 

Dutch and UK assets that have an EPC label A or higher.

Total operating expenditure, as the sum of direct non-
capitalized costs, including:

1.  Research and development

2.  Building renovation measures

3.  Short-term lease

4.  Maintenance and repair

5.  Any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day 

servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment by the 
undertaking or third party.

As such the denominator of the OpEx KPI is defined differently and is comprised 

of  specific  expenses  summarized  in  “property  operating  expenses”  disclosed  in 

the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss of this report. The OpEx denominator 
amount is therefore not mentioned as such in the financial statement.

OpEx  is  considered  as  overall  operating  expenses  that  is  linked  to  activitiy  7.7 

(Acquisition and ownership of buildings) and therefore to the overall maintenance 

and day-to-day servicing of properties.

Hence, the calculation of the aligned OpEx is linked, to the extent possible, to the

equipment) as well as capital expenditure on investment property and acquisition 

on investment property both from note 13 (investment property).  

The  EU  Taxonomy-aligned  CapEx  comprises  costs  incurred  from  economic 

activities 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6. Where refurbishment, energy efficiency projects 

or renewable energy projects last for several years, only those expenses that were 

capitalized in the relevant reporting year are calculated as EU Taxonomy-eligible 

or aligned CapEx.

CapEx  linked  to  activities  7.4  and  7.6  mostly  relates  to  infrastructure  costs  of 

necessary modernization, upgrades or technical equipment of the properties prior 

to the installation of EV charging stations or PV systems respectively. The majority 

of CapEx is currently invested by our partner company. CapEx linked to activity 7.7 

represents acquisitions of new assets in 2023. The CapEx numerator did not include 

CapEx as part of a CapEx plan.

OUR WORKFORCE:
LABOR STANDARDS AND EMPLOYEE TOPICS

Long-term Targets

 ● Be among the top ten most attractive employers in the commercial real estate 

sector by 2030

 ● Maintain zero incidents of discrimination

 ● Offer a minimum of 12hrs of training and development opportunities per FTE 

per year

2024 Goals

 ● Implement our newly developed staff career path to create more transparency on 

development opportunities

Policy, Anti-Discrimination Policy, Human Rights Policy, Anti-Corruption Policy and 

Whistleblowing Policy – all allow us to manage impacts, risks and opportunities 

relating to our workforce. These policies cover all of our own employees and were 

developed with the interests of our employees in mind. Our social policies detail 

our  commitments  to  the  protection  of  our  employees’  human  rights,  health  and 

safety,  and  protection  against  discrimination  and  harassment.  They  also  detail 

how  our  employees  should  keep  us  safe  in  relation  to  corruption  and  bribery 

prevention. The centralization of our HR Department ensures that processes and 

policies are standardized across the Group, meaning that knowledge and talents 

are effectively used across the board.  

Following the request from our employees, in 2023, we developed staff career 

paths, including specific KPIs, which intend to create a clear structure and more 

transparency  regarding  career  and  development  opportunities  at  Aroundtown. 

These career paths are expected to be communicated and applied from spring 

2024. We  also  ensure  all  our  employees  are  paid  adequate  wages  in  line  with 

applicable benchmarks.

It is fundamental for a responsible business that everyone should feel safe and

protected,  and  we  take  significant  steps  to  ensure  that  our  work  environment 

has a positive impact on the health and well-being of our people. Beyond this 

foundation, we seek to excel in factors such as career development, education, 

work-life balance, well-being, and diversity and inclusion, which are required to 

attract and retain today’s top talent. The interests, views and rights of our own 

employees primarily relate to human rights and health and safety. Our approach 

to the protection of our workforce is explained in the following section.  

We engage with our employees in a number of ways, primarily through our annual 

employee engagement survey which allows us to obtain direct feedback from all 

employees. We also conduct regular HR Roundtables during which our employees 

and managers have the opportunity to ask questions and engage directly with our 

HR Department. Our Group Head of HR is responsible for overseeing our annual 

employee  satisfaction  survey,  as  well  as  our  HR  Roundtables  and  we  use  the 

results of both to inform decisions or activities that will help manage actual and

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report85

To  ensure  straightforward  communication  with  staff  across  the  Group,  we  have 
implemented an HR software as an employee engagement tool. Through this platform, 
employees can manage personal data, holiday and home office requests, sick leave, 
and book training and participation at other company events. We are continuing to roll 
out new features to make the system more user-friendly. Our goal is for this software 
to serve as a centralized HR system across all our locations of operation, so that all our 
employees have easy and consistent access to the information they need, and to make 
the employees and the HR Department more agile.

In 2023, we conducted a survey with our employees, the results of which will guide 
our strategy to improve workplace satisfaction. The results were a clear indication 
of the engagement of our employees, with a 63% response rate across the Group. 
From  this,  we  have  identified  priority  areas  for  improvement  in  our  HR  policies, 
and we formulated an action plan for 2023 and 2024 to act on this feedback. This 
included further employee surveys to provide more opportunities for feedback and 
communication,  furthering  information  about  career  progression,  and  increased 
communication about Aroundtown’s overall strategy and vision, and the promotion 
path opportunities which employees can pursue within our organization. 

This  year,  our  commitment  to  a  positive  work  environment  was  reflected  by  two 
key milestones. Aroundtown was awarded ‘Top Company 2024’ by Kununu, a leading 
platform  for  employer  reviews  and  feedback  on  corporate  culture,  compensation 
schemes,  and  overall  employee  satisfaction.  This  placed  us  among  the  top  5% 
of  all  employer  profiles  in  the  platform  in  2023 –  a  confirmation  of  our  strong 
engagement for a great working environment and the satisfaction of our employees. 
Our subsidiary, GCP, was chosen as ‘Most Wanted Start 2024’ by the newspaper, Die 
Zeit, and Kununu, demonstrating GCP’s position as a leading apprenticeship company 
in Germany, highlighting our commitment to employee development. 

As  part  of  our  ongoing  efforts  to  enhance  workforce  satisfaction  and  well-being, 
our collaboration with a work-life platform in Germany continued throughout 2023. 
The  platform  extends  comprehensive  support  to  our  employees,  which  includes 
family-oriented  services  like  childcare  for  holidays,  emergencies,  daily  needs,  and 
elderly  care.  The  platform  further  enriches  the  employee  experience  by  offering 
programs  for  expecting  parents,  promoting  a  healthy  work-life  balance  through 
virtual sports courses and mental health prevention programs, and providing access 
to diverse consultations and talks on leading a healthy life, diversity and inclusion, 
and addressing discrimination concerns. These offerings align with our commitment 

Training and Development

We place great importance on delivering a broad learning and development program 

to our staff to provide them with the skills required to prosper in today’s business 

environment and further their careers. Our training is targeted to individual needs 

and  delivered  flexibly  to  meet  the  needs  of  all  our  employees. We  utilize  our  in-

house  expertise,  as  well  as  external  specialists,  to  deliver  training  ranging  from 

construction and property management to business skills and leadership training. 

Training  is  delivered  in  person,  through  online  webinars,  or  via  our  self-directed 

learning  portal,  the  Contemporary  Real  Estate  Academy  (CREA).  This  platform 

enables a unified presentation of our mandatory training content and learning and 

development material, which is accessible to all staff across our business. In 2023, 

additional features were added that allow for better communication with employees 

on training opportunities and advanced tracking of training data and the creation of 

reports for content owners and admin users from our HR Department.

We have also continued to implement performance reviews digitally through our 

HR software. Managers receive training on using the tool to provide performance 

feedback  and  can  then  provide  ratings  and  reviews  digitally.  In  2024,  we  plan 

to  relaunch  the  performance  review  tool  across  the  Aroundtown  departments 

in  Germany,  with  a  new  career  development  plan,  aiming  to  deliver  60%  of 

performance  reviews  using  this  method.  Streamlining  this  review  process  will 

allow  our  employees  to  receive  personal  feedback  more  simply  and  regularly, 

helping them to improve and progress towards their own goals.

In 2023, we also continued to expand our leadership training program, delivering 

2,430 hours of training for upcoming leaders within our organization. In addition, 

we  maintained  our  mentoring  scheme,  enabling  our  employees  to  receive 

professional  coaching  support  from  more  senior  team  members. These  programs 

sought  to  boost  individual  employee  performance  while  securing  our  long-term 

viability. The  leadership  program  is  designed  to  equip  the  company’s  current  and 

potential leaders with the fundamental critical thinking and problem-solving skills 

essential for making sound decisions. It aims to improve communication and team 

management skills, conflict resolution, as well as innovativeness and productivity. 

Employees who participate in this program are provided with the skills necessary to 

to fostering a positive and supportive work culture.

As an international company representing more than 60 nationalities, headquartered 

in  Germany,  we  also  support  our  employees  with  language  classes  in  English  and 

German. In 2023, we continued to pursue our intensive focus on language learning, 

partnering with a well-known language school to offer advanced German courses for 

non-native speakers and English for German speakers, with 3,557 hours of training 

To  contribute  further  to  the  well-being  of  our  employees,  we  offer  a  flexible 

package of benefits and working provisions, such as hybrid working arrangements 

to  support  working  from  home,  and  flexible  working  hours.  Part-time  working 

options  also  grant  greater  flexibility  for  our  employees  to  balance  their  work 

around their lives and families. Such part-time arrangements are specific to the 

provided. The language program is targeted at promoting effective communication 

employee’s needs.

and collaboration amongst employees and other stakeholders. It enhances operational 

efficiency, tears down cultural barriers, reduces misunderstandings, builds trust, and 

fosters a more inclusive workplace environment.

Occupational Health and Safety

We take our responsibility to provide a safe work environment seriously and ensure 

that  tasks  do  not  pose  undue  health  risks.  Our  Occupational  Health  and  Safety 

Policy  ensures  strict  compliance  with  all  workplace  health  and  safety  regulations 

at  national  and  EU  level.  We  are  jointly  responsible  for  occupational  health  and 

safety through the avoidance of risks to ourselves and our employees by identifying 

and reporting any unsafe working conditions, violations of safety requirements, and 

accidents  in  the  workplace. The  implementation  of  this  policy  is  overseen  by  our 

dedicated internal Office Health and Safety Manager and by the internal inspections 

of  the  occupational  safety  standards  in  our  workplaces.  We  also  undergo  ad  hoc 

external audits by state officers, but none have taken place in 2023. 

In order to manage material risks, impacts and opportunities to our workforce, we 

set targets to help mitigate these risks and maximize opportunities. In 2023, we 

increased  our  internal  budget  for  employee  training,  including  for  occupational 

health  and  safety,  with  some  employees  being  identified  as  knowledge  owners 

The wider health and well-being benefits provided include eye examinations and 

health checks carried by our company physician, access to our company gym for 

employees  at  our  Berlin  headquarters  with  courses  and  personalized  training, 

and  mental  health  appointments  available  for  all  employees  with  our  in-house 

consultant.

Furthermore,  our  collaboration  with  a  work-life  platform  mentioned  under  the 

Employee Satisfaction section also contributes to fostering a secure and supportive 

workplace environment. Offerings underpinning our commitment to occupational 

health and safety include hundreds of virtual sports and mental health prevention 

courses  covering  topics  from  mindfulness  to  resilience,  and  numerous  talks 

and  consultation  offers  promoting  a  healthy  lifestyle. Additionally,  the  platform 

provides  access  to  a  24/7  emergency  hotline  staffed  by  qualified  psychologists 

and coaches, ensuring prompt psychological support during critical situations. To 

help manage stress, specific trainings, coaching and other methods such as Open 

Space are also available.

Equal Treatment and Opportunities for All

We  are  committed  to  promoting  equal  treatment  and  opportunities  for  all 

within  our  workforce.  Our  Anti-Discrimination  Policy  specifically  addresses  the 

who then delivered training sessions themselves. The 169 certified first-aiders in 

following  grounds  for  discrimination:  race  or  ethnic  origin,  gender,  religion  or

We monitor our employee numbers by both geographical area and contract type as

duly investigated. Further, our Diversity Policy details the diversity initiatives that

In  2023,  as  a  result  of  the  ‘Activate  the  Base’  initiative,  a  Diversity  Committee 

comprising  employee  representatives  from  different  organizational  levels  was 

established with the aim of overseeing our commitments to diversity, inclusion and 

anti-discrimination. A dedicated site is now available in our intranet containing up-

to-date topics and information, and comprehensive diversity training is now provided 

to all employees upon joining the organization. To strengthen our commitment, the 

position of Chief Diversity Officer was also established during 2023, and is currently 

held by the Group Head of HR.

Work-Related Rights

We respect and promote human rights throughout our organization with the help of 

stringent policies and procedures. Should we operate in areas at risk of human rights 

violations,  we  have  committed  to  undertake  human  rights  due  diligence  and  risk 

assessments. We regard every person as unique, and recognize people‘s individual 

differences  such  as  ethnic  origin,  gender,  religion  or  belief,  experience,  physical 

and mental abilities, age, and sexual identity. In this way, we ensure our employees, 
tenants, and business partners, including our suppliers, respect the shared human 

rights of all people, in line with international regulations such as the International 

Labor  Organization‘s  Core  Labor  Standards,  and  the  UN  Guiding  Principles  on 

Business and Human Rights. Our policies concerning our employee’s work-related 

rights refer to forced or compulsory labor, and child labor. However, they currently do 

not explicitly refer to trafficking in human beings. We commit to duly consider this 

aspect during our policy reviews.

Metrics: Our Workforce 

As part of our commitment to improving employee satisfaction, maintaining high 

standards of health and safety, and ensuring all employees receive equal treatment 

and opportunities, we monitor and measure a series of metrics to help understand 

our progress in areas relating to our workforce. Employee data disclosed below is 

representative of the figures at the end of the reporting period and are reported in 

full-time equivalent.

Table 13 presents the gender pay gap within our employees. This indicator measures 
the disparity in earnings between women and men, calculated as the average gross 
hourly earnings of female employees divided in the average gross hourly earnings 
of male employees. We closely monitor and report this difference based on various 
levels of aggregation in an effort to increase transparency and conform to widely 
accepted standards. The data is split based on employee remuneration (salary and 
bonus) and basic salary in relation to employee level.

In  2023,  we  launched  several  projects  to  improve  tenant  satisfaction,  including  a

continue expanding in 2024. A tenant lounge at one of our properties, a discounted

of  scooter  and  bicycle  rental  programs  for  our  tenants  as  well  as  an  improved 

parking scheme, and the installation of solar panels onsite. The renewable electricity 

generated with these panels will be made available for sale to our tenants, aiding 

them  in  reducing  their  individual  carbon  impact.  Within  our  residential  portfolio, 

awareness raising initiatives such as information videos or leaflets advice tenants 

on sustainable practices including efficient heating and ventilation.

in  environmental  efficiency  measures  are  an  integral  part  of  this  strategy.  Larger

100% of our Dutch office portfolio. In addition, we certified the first German offices

contracts  (those  with  7+  years’  contract  duration).  The  results  also  demonstrated 

good  satisfaction  with  our  external  service  providers,  with  the  average  ratings 

for  friendliness,  accessibility,  competence,  responsiveness  and  service  orientation 

all indicating positive satisfaction. However, in our pursuit of conducting a tenant 

survey in compliance with GDPR regulations, the scope of participation was limited, 

as we needed to acquire signed consent from each tenant to use their data.

in 2023, for which we paused the survey and focused on establishing a streamlined 

process for including consent forms in new lease contracts and amendments  of 

existing  ones.  Simultaneously,  we  initiated  the  integration  of  consent  data  into 

our  SAP  System  for  a  more  efficient  and  secure  approach.  In  parallel  to  this,  as 

the  survey  highlighted  some  areas  for  improvement,  we  rolled-out  action  plans 

informed  by  the  results,  which  will  also  guide  much  of  our  work  in  2024.  For

users, we include all tenants who can be materially impacted by our activities.

Aroundtown  now  offers  a  24/7  hotline  for  our  commercial  tenants  through  the 

Service  Center  to  provide  a  point  of  contact  outside  normal  service  hours.  We 

also started the process of developing an online service portal, in which tenants 

will be able to send requests directly into our CRM system, which speeds up the 

service process. This will be implemented in 2024 alongside a website for tenant 

services containing relevant information and features. Furthermore, we have been 

developing a Tenant Retention program in the form of a modular set of measures 

for  expanding  the  service  offerings  in  our  properties,  for  example  by  creating 

coworking  spaces,  conference  areas  or  gym  facilities.  Our  efforts  align  with  our 

dedication to providing a more dynamic tenant-centric experience, which we hope 

will be reflected in the results of future surveys.

For our properties in the Netherlands, we sent out the annual satisfaction survey 

by  email  in August,  in  cooperation  with  an  external  agency. The  survey  covered 

various aspects, including the service provided by the Service Desk, the condition 

of  the  building  and  its  surroundings,  general  sustainability  matters,  and  overall 

satisfaction.  In  2023,  the  sustainability  satisfaction  score  showed  a  significant 

improvement of 9.5% compared to 2022, while tenant involvement in sustainability 

continued  to  increase,  evidenced  through  and  facilitated  by  discussions  during 

tenant meetings. 

The overall service satisfaction has also seen a positive increase of 7.1%. To enhance 

performance further, KPIs for this department have been adjusted for the upcoming 

year,  with  the  aim  of  achieving  a  yearly  improvement  of  at  least  3%.  Across  all 

measured areas, scores have surpassed those of 2022 and it is our overall goal to 

continue to improve performance.

Tenant Health and Safety

Guaranteeing  high  standards  of  health  and  safety  within  our  buildings  is  a 

fundamental  obligation  to  our  tenants,  and  a  prerequisite  to  ensuring  their 

satisfaction with our service. Through the dedication of our property management 

teams, we work continually to instill a positive health and safety culture across our 

operations. Our ultimate goal is to protect tenants and third parties from health and 

safety  risks,  and  to  deliver  an  environment  which  is  healthy,  safe  and  motivating, 

Health and safety are central to our asset management approach at every stage of 

a  property’s  life  cycle.  At  acquisition,  we  conduct  a  comprehensive  due  diligence 

risk  assessment  which  enables  us  to  identify  risks  and  implement  preventative 

maintenance  solutions.  We  assess  the  building’s  structural  characteristics  and 

establish which refurbishment activities should be targeted, looking for opportunities 

to improve the quality and accessibility of the property. Various measures are then 

implemented to support tenants’ well-being, easier movement around the building, 

and additional communal space and services. 

The  Aroundtown  Tenant  Health  and  Safety  Policy  sets  out  our  commitment  to 

protecting the well-being of our tenants and the processes we apply through the 

asset  lifecycle,  including  hazard  assessment,  training,  fire  safety,  and  reporting. 

The  policy  details  a  three-tier  management  approach,  with  distinct  roles  and 

responsibilities assigned to our facility, property and asset management teams, and 

is in compliance with all statutory norms and safety requirements in the countries 

where we are operational.

During the operational phase, we conduct technical reviews of our properties on an 

ongoing basis, to ensure alignment with regulations and to guide future investment 

planning. Our external facility managers are tasked with operational responsibility 

for  providing  the  information  and  carrying  out  the  necessary  tasks  to  maintain 

the  technical  condition  of  our  assets.  This  encompasses  documenting  all  checks 

performed on technical installations and building structures. Reports are forwarded 

to Aroundtown, and any identified remedial works are incorporated into our annual 

budget planning for each property or addressed promptly if required. In 2023, we 

advanced  in  this  domain  by  strategically  aligning  with  two  contractors  that  are 

required to adhere to stringent health and safety reporting standards.

Our standard operating procedures for all assets guarantee complete compliance 

with  fire  and  safety  regulations.  This  involves  investigating  and  documenting 

safety incidents. We regularly commission the legally required assessments from 

external fire safety specialists as well as conduct statutory checks with the regional 

fire brigade. If deficits are identified, these are documented and reported to the 

Head of Technical Property Management, who is then responsible for seeing that 

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report97

the required work is carried out. The proper implementation of these corrections is 

confirmed by appropriate follow-up processes, which include an onsite inspection 

and  subsequent  clearance  report  to  the  authorities  after  the  deficits  have  been 

processed. Our objective is to safeguard tenants and third parties from health and 

safety hazards while providing a healthy, secure, and inspiring work environment 

that satisfies our tenants. 

Besides the Tenant Health and Safety Policy, our Human Rights Policy also details 

our commitment to protecting the human rights of our tenants. Although this policy 

is  currently  confidential,  it  has  been  written  in  accordance  with  the  UN  Guiding 

Principles on Business and Human Rights and in particular respects the privacy of 

our  tenants  through  data  protection  measures. Any  and  all  reported violations  of 

human rights are recorded by our Compliance Department and reported directly to 

our CEO and a member of the board of Directors. We are committed to reporting 

human rights violations and include this risk within our risk management process.  

Metrics: Consumers and End-Users

AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND  
NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT

Investors  in  the  built  environment  are  expected  to  think  beyond  their  commercial 
interest,  to  create  long-term  socio-economic  benefit  in  the  communities  they 
operate  in.  By  building  productive  relationships  with  the  local  community,  we  can 
contribute  to  the  development  of  prosperous  neighborhoods,  which  in  turn  will 
benefit  our  properties  and  their  tenants.  The  principal  interests,  views  and  rights 
of our local communities relate to affordability, engagement and human rights. We 
actively engage with the wider communities surrounding and within our properties 
to promote neighborliness and connection. Our approach to meeting the needs of our 
communities is underpinned by our Community Involvement and Development Policy.

Long-Term Targets

 ● Invest up to €1 million p.a. in community projects via the Aroundtown and GCP 

Foundations

 ● Build partnerships with local stakeholders to achieve targeted impact with 

communities around Group assets

local communities’ needs. This includes the projects sponsored by the Aroundtown 

and  GCP  Foundations,  and  open  and  meaningful  engagement  and  consultation 

opportunities  with  external  stakeholders.  Thus,  active  community  contributions 

are one of our key priorities moving into 2024. 

Our  investment  approach  of  targeting  properties  with  value-add  potential  sees 

us  invest  in  properties  in  need  of  retrofitting  with  broader  opportunities  for 

ESG  improvements.  These  types  of  assets  provide  significant  potential  to  deliver 

improvements for the properties’ tenants and nearby residents through investment 

in  building  systems  and  facilities,  shared  services,  aesthetics  of  external  facades 

and  improved  maintenance. We  strive  to  create  spaces  for  dialogue  with  existing 

tenants  and  local  authorities  as  soon  as  an  asset  is  acquired,  to  determine  how 

the needs and concerns of the community can be addressed through the long-term 

asset strategy. These community consultations are usually in the form of meetings 

and workshops.

Some  of  these  events  have  been  a  tradition  for  many  years  and  always  include  a 

call  for  participation  through  multiple  channels  to  foster  engagement.  The  high 

participation numbers and the high tenant satisfaction rate on the initiatives of 97% 

reflect the great reception from the tenants, and we are proud to continue building up 

our efforts for community engagement in 2024.

encourage young people to form their own political values and opinions. 

October 2023 in Berlin.

Affordable Housing

Much  of  our  community  impact  comes  from  our  residential  properties,  owned 

through  our  subsidiary,  GCP.  GCP’s  tenants  represent  a  wide  range  of  social, 

economic  and  cultural  backgrounds.  To  provide  properties  which  serve  these 

communities, we are committed to providing affordable housing, so to monitor our 

performance in this regard, the Group has developed a “rental cost portion” metric 

modeled on Eurostat’s housing cost overburden rate. This metric compares GCP’s 

median rent for residential units against the net minimum wage, reflecting salary 

after taxes and social security contributions, which  we believe is a conservative 

benchmark focusing on those most sensitive to rent affordability.  

The housing cost portion based on the median warm rent of GCP’s residential properties 

in Germany in 2023 was 39% of this benchmark, up from 38% in 2022. The warm rent 

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report100

incorporates various costs of living including energy costs, and housing services, which 

Metrics: Affected Communities

GCP has no control over. The rental cost portion based on median cold rent in 2023 

for our German residential properties, excluding these factors, remained at 24% of the 

net minimum wage salary in 2023. These figures show that increased housing costs 

in 2023 were driven by utility and service cost inflation rather than increasing rental 

costs,  along  with  observations  that  wage  growth  lagged  in  the  current  inflationary 

environment. Germany has already acted to increase the minimum wage as of January 

1st, 2024, along with another increase set for 2025, which should improve housing 

affordability if the trend of a decreasing rate of inflation continues. These results are 

testament  to  the  Group’s  commitment  to  ensuring  that  our  high-quality  residential 

properties are priced affordably for all our tenants.

Modernization Rent Increases

Our subsidiary GCP launched its modernization program for its residential properties 

and is carrying a relatively small program, targeted to where it can make a significant 

impact.  As  part  of  our  commitment  to  providing  affordable  housing,  GCP  works  to 

ensure  that  modernization  cost  allocation  to  tenants  is  done  in  a  way  that  keeps 

housing affordable. To determine these cost allocations, the Rent Control and Increase 

Department analyses the current market situation and relevant regulations on cost 

allocations, to decide whether to enact rental increase waivers on the modernization 

costs. The average modernization cost allocation for our German residential properties 

in 2023 was €0.53/sqm, which is 16% lower than the legally possible cost allocation 

set out in German law.

In cases of significant rent increases, tenants can object to the cost allocation in what 

is  known  as  a  financial  hardship  case.  These  can  be  resolved  through  a  complete 

or partial waiver of the entitled rent increase for a given number of years. In 2023, 

however, zero  hardship  cases  were  received  out  of  the  1,349  units  modernized. We 

believe this low number of hardship case applications reflects the targeted approach 

to conducting modernization projects, and the careful consideration that is put into 

rent  increases  which  in  many  cases  is  partially  waived  based  on  the  company’s 

understanding  of  the  local  market  situation.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  not 

placing pressure on our tenants in cases of financial hardship, we ensure that any and 

all  changes  are  discussed  with  our  tenants  beforehand. This  transparent  and  open 

approach allows security and trusted relationships with our tenants. 

Our  dedication  to  maintaining  strong  community  connections  and  developing 

longstanding  relationships  is  demonstrated  by  our  Community  Involvement 

and  Development  Policy,  which  guides  our  efforts  towards  tenant  engagement. 

Particularly for our residential portfolio, a range of community events are organized 

such as seasonal tenant festivals and campaigns throughout the year, on site and/or 

digitally. By organizing various tenant events also digitally, our residential tenants at 

all locations have the opportunity to participate. This is enhanced by complementary 

tenant benefits, such as an additional incentive for the residential tenants loyalty 

program  or  embedding  the  digital  campaigns  in  the  GCP  app.  These  initiatives 

impact the wider community and are considered stakeholder engagement programs. 

For 2024, we strive to set up an effective tracking system that allows us to better 

measure  the  reach  of  the  initiatives  in  terms  of  actual  impact  generated  in  the 

communities -  such  as  actual  participation  rates  and  satisfaction  levels  with  the 

various programs.

of the Board of Directors, and includes as voting members independent director 

Mr. Markus Kreuter and executive director Mr. Frank Roseen, as well as advisory 

members including the Group’s Head of the Sustainability Department, Head of 

the  Energy  Department  and  Head  of  Human  Resources  Department  as  well  as 

the Chief Operating Officer of a key Group company. The ESG Committee oversees 

strategic guidance on ESG topics and is responsible for reviewing and assessing 

Aroundtown’s responsible business strategy, policies and practices with respect 

to ESG. The Committee meets at least quarterly, with additional meetings called 

as required, and sets the direction for the work of the Sustainability Department. 

The  Sustainability  Department  acts  as  a  cross-departmental  interface,  working 

across the Group to implement and monitor sustainability programs and initiatives 

at an operational level. It is led by the Head of Sustainability and reports directly 

to the CEO and to the Chairperson of the Board of Directors. The Department also 

prepares the Group’s materiality analysis and ESG reporting, as well as responds to 

enquiries by investors and rating agencies on ESG topics. It collaborates closely with 

the Energy Department, which applies its engineering expertise to implement the 

technical elements of our sustainability strategy. There are constant exchanges of 

information between departments around ESG-related aspects.

pursuant  to  the  Rules  of  Procedure  of  the  Risk  Committee. The  Risk  Committee 

provides  advice  on  actions  of  risk  management,  in  particular  by  reviewing  the 

Group’s  risk  management  procedures  established  by  the  management  and 

their  effectiveness  for  risk  detection,  assessment,  prioritization,  mitigation  and 

monitoring, as well as its internal control system. The Board of Directors decides 

on  the  composition,  tasks  and  terms  of  the  Risk  Committee  members  and  the 

appointment and dismissal of its members, and of the CRO. Members of the Risk 

Committee are Mr. Markus Kreuter (Chairperson), Mr. Markus Leininger, Ms. Simone 

Runge Brandner, Mr. Daniel Malkin, Mr. Frank Roseen and Mr. Ran Laufer. 

Internal Controls and Risk Management Systems

The Group closely monitors and manages any potential risks and sets appropriate 

measures  to  mitigate  the  occurrence  and/or  impact  of  any  possible  failure  to  an 

acceptable level. The risk management supervision is led by the Risk Committee, which 

reviews the risk management structure, organization, processes and coordinates risk-

related training. The Group categorizes the risk management systems into two main 

categories: internal risk mitigation and external risk mitigation. The internal controls 

system and compliance of the Group is monitored by the Compliance Department.

Internal Risk Mitigation

Internal controls are constructed from five main elements: 

 ● Risk management – set by the Risk Committee and guided by an ongoing analysis 
of the organizational structure and by identifying potential weaknesses. Further, 

the committee assesses control deficiencies impacting the risk management 

framework in the organization, supported by CCO and CRO. 

 ● Control discipline – based on the organizational structure and supported by 
employee and management commitments. The discipline is erected on the 

foundations of integrity and ethical values.

 ● Control features – the Group sets physical controls, compliance checks and 
verifications such as cross departmental checks. The Group puts strong emphasis 

 ● Monitoring procedures – the Group monitors and tests unusual entries, mainly 
through a detailed monthly Actual vs. Budget analysis and additional checks. 

Strong and sustainable internal control system significantly reduces the probability 

and materiality of errors. The management sees high importance in constantly 

improving all measures, adjusting to market changes and organizational dynamics. 

 ● ESG risk-related expenditures – the Group has included the identification of 
potential financial liabilities and future expenditures linked to ESG risks in the 

enterprise risk management. Potential future expenditures on ESG matters and 

opportunities are included in the financial budget. 

The Group has established procedures to protect the confidentiality and integrity 

of management information and data across all business processes. Furthermore, 

we implemented a wide range of guidelines and provisions, with the ratification 

of  the  EU  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR),  including  enhanced 

mandatory awareness training on GDPR. The Group has implemented Standard 

Operating Procedures (SOP) to ensure that all personal data stored and processed 

in  the  course  of  the  Group’s  operations  is  safe  from  manipulation  and  misuse. 

Additionally, the Group adopted an information security and privacy strategy in 

order to maintain a high level of controls to help minimize the potential risks. 

The diligence of the Group with regards to all compliance issues presents itself 

in  the  level  of  zero  compliance-related  tolerance.  Both  our  Business  Partners 

Code of Conduct and Employee Code of Conduct can be found on our website.  

External Risk Mitigation 

Through its ordinary course of business, the Group is exposed to various external 

risks.  The  Risk  Committee  is  therefore  constantly  determining  whether  the 

appropriate infrastructure, resources and systems are in place and are adequate to 

maintain an acceptable level of risk. The potential risks and exposure are related, 

inter  alia,  to  volatility  of  interest  rate  risk,  inflation  risk,  liquidity  risk,  credit  risk, 

regulatory and legal risk, collection and tenant deficiencies, the need to unexpected 

capital investments, property damage risk, physical climate risks, market downturn 

risk and geopolitical risk. The Group sets direct, specific guidelines and boundaries 

on separation of duties as approval and payment are completed by at least two 

to mitigate and address each risk of failure or potential default, by hedging and/or 

separate parties. Payment verification is cross checked and confirmed with budget 

reducing it to an acceptable level of impact and/or occurrence.

necessary. Under current procedures, the Group assesses climate-related risk at the 

portfolio level; however, it is the Group’s long-term ambition to conduct an asset-

level  analysis. The  Group’s  focus  is  to  prioritize  information  which  provides  the 

most accurate image of regional and local climate risks, as well as opportunities 

arising from the necessary transition.

Climate-related  risks  are  taken  into  account  throughout  the  process  described 

above.  A  comprehensive  risk  matrix  catalogue  for  each  risk  group  has  been 

compiled for the Group, including physical and transitional climate-related risks.

Remuneration Committee

The  Board  of  Directors  established  a  Remuneration  Committee  to  determine 

and  recommend  to  the  Board  the  Company’s  Remuneration  Policy  and  prepares 

and  recommends  to  the  Board  remuneration  proposals  for  members  of  the 

Board,  the  Executive  Directors  and  Senior  Management  including  evaluation  of 

short-  and  long-term  performance-related  remuneration  to  senior  executives.

ESG-Linked Remuneration

The ability to quantify climate related risks depends, inter alia, on the availability 

The  Remuneration  Policy  is  recommended  to  the  Board  by  the  Remuneration 

of data and methodologies. The Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) tool is 

Committee. It applies to the Company’s executive individuals and independent and 

an emerging best practice for stranding risk assessment in the real estate sector 

and  is  a  methodology  taken  into  consideration  by  the  Group. While  CRREM  was 

found to be the most advanced tool for assessing alignment with Paris Agreement 

targets, its current methodology poses challenges limiting its practical usability 

for  landlords  to  focus  on  renovation  planning  to  address  energy  and  carbon 

intensity  under  their  own  sphere  of  influence.  The  Group  has  thus  prioritized 

applying stranding definitions based on EPCs and the EU’s climate commitments 

embodied in the EPBD recast, which grants a better understanding of investment 

actions  needed  and  the  expected  results  of  those  actions  specific  to  each  asset 

class, both in terms of their sustainability and financial impacts.

In  order  to  further  engage  stakeholders,  including  the  value  chain  and  workers 

in  our value  chain,  the  Group  intends  to  develop  a  methodology  in  2024  which

to  specific  ESG  targets,  such  as  the  annual  progress  towards  Scope  1  and  2 

emissions  reductions,  the  annual  increase  of  the  proportion  of  buildings  with 

green certifications, the Group’s ESG rating, and gender equality. In 2023, the Group 

has committed to aligning the remuneration of its executive individuals with the 

requirements of the Remuneration Policy and the changes will become effective as 

of 2023 and 2024.

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report110

FAIR BUSINESS AND COMPLIANCE

Our  business  strategy  is  underpinned  by  our  fundamental  commitment  to 

ethical  conduct,  robust  corporate  governance,  and  high  levels  of  transparency. 

Safeguarding the Group from any reputational damage due to error or misconduct 

is essential in maintaining the Group’s reputation. Therefore, enforcing responsible 

behavior  guided  by  integrity  is  a  central  tool  for  the  management  in  terms  of 

its  dealings.  For  this  reason,  the  compliance  and  risk  management  teams  are 

structured accordingly and supplemented by internal review procedures, covering 

all steps of real estate investment and management chain. In order to stipulate 

ethical  behavior  throughout  its  operations,  Aroundtown  implemented  Code  of 

Conducts  for  both  its  employment  contracts  and  business  partners  contracts 

which include policies that prevent compliance violations and misconducts. These 

policies  include  Anti-Corruption,  Diversity  and  Anti-Discrimination,  Anti-Bribery, 

measures to prevent human right violations, Data Protection Declaration and User 

Policy, as well as a Whistleblowing Policy. 

This framework seeks to embed our principles of integrity, respect, performance, 

accountability, and sustainability into all of our business activities. We ensure our 

Board  of  Directors  and  senior  executives  hold  vast  experience  and  skillsets  in 

relevant business areas in order to help maintain our high governance standards.

Long-term Targets

 ● Keep our level of fair business relationships with our customers and suppliers

 ● Maintain zero tolerance towards compliance violations

2024 Goals

 ● Maintain high-level awareness and engagement with our Group policies

 ● Review and implement actions to comply with new European regulations (e.g., 

CSRD) during 2024

To  ensure  our  high  ethical  standards  are  embedded  in  our  business,  we  have 

developed  a  comprehensive  compliance  framework.  This  system  is  designed  to 

adapt to increasingly complex legal frameworks, and to protect our business from 

the risks associated with unethical conduct. The expectations and requirements of 

this framework are clearly set out through our Group-level policies and standards. 

Alignment with these standards is monitored by internal control mechanisms, and 

in case of deviations we have a clear reporting and response process.  All Group-

wide policies mentioned in this section are aligned with and approved by the Board 

of  Directors.  This  ensures  and  justifies  the  clear  statement  of  Aroundtown’s  top 

management that these policies are a crucial part of the Group and binding for each 

and every one working for and with Aroundtown.   

Our compliance and risk management teams are structured accordingly to ensure 

responsible behavior guides us, and they are supplemented by internal monitoring 

procedures, covering all steps of real estate investment and management. 

Employee Code of Conduct

At the heart of the internal policies for compliance is our Employee Code of Conduct. 

This sets out the principles of our commitment to ethical behaviour and is a contractual 

requirement for our staff at every level. The Employee Code of Conduct covers our 

standards  on  topics  including  bribery,  corruption,  fair  competition  and  anti-trust, 

conflict of interest, and discrimination. It is supplemented by topical guidelines and 

specific policies, such as the Anti-Corruption Policy, the Global Information Security 

Policy, the Diversity Policy, and the Anti-Discrimination Policy. Aroundtown is also a 

signatory of the Charta der Vielfalt (German Diversity Charter). For more information 

on our anti-discrimination efforts, please refer to the subsection Equal Treatment 

and Opportunities for All. Another crucial subject in our compliance program is the 

management of ethical standards in our supply chain as described in the section 

 ● Adherence to the Group risk management strategy by performing compliance risk 

Workers in the Value Chain.  

assessment

 ● Ensure the voluntary alignment of our Group policies to the new Supply Chain 

Act in Germany (LkSG) 

In its Employee Code of Conduct, the Group has also instruments in-place to prevent 

and fight violations of law, such as human rights violation, corruption, and bribery. 

The employees have reporting channels in case of a possible violation where the 

measures  are  dealt  with  in  confidence  to  the  full  extent  permitted  by  statutory

Aroundtown‘s  Code  of  Conduct  includes  the  prohibition  of  insider  dealing. 

Aroundtown is subject to several obligations under Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 

(Market Abuse  Regulation  (MAR)),  as  amended. Aroundtown  notifies  (including  by 

way of training sessions) pursuant to applicable provisions under MAR, all persons 

discharging  managerial  responsibilities  of  their  obligations  in  the  context  of 

managers’  transactions.  Memorandums,  notifications,  training  and  information  are 

distributed regularly.

Outstanding  leadership  is  crucial  in  this  regard.  Our  managers  are  expected  to 

be  examples  of  our  core values  of  mutual  respect  and  clear  communication. This 

standard of behavior usually shows positive effects on our commercial success, as 

contradiction of our Code of Conduct without any fear of repercussions, as dictated 

by  the  Whistleblower  Protection Act.  Issues  can  also  be  reported  in  person,  but 

to  guarantee  total  anonymity  when  preferred,  we  work  with  a  third-party  web 

application  to  allow  stakeholders  to  register  any  suspected  misconduct  in  good 

faith to ensure whistleblowing protection in line with our Whistleblowing Policy. 

Our  intranet  page  ensures  availability  and  awareness  of  this  platform  for  our 

employees and the whistleblowing system can also be accessed via our website by 

external stakeholders. This whistleblowing process is key to the effectiveness of the 

compliance framework. Should a report be submitted through our whistleblowing 

platform,  an  investigation  is  launched  by  a  responsible  user  of  the  system,  or  a 

member of Group Compliance to ensure objectivity of the investigation.

Academy (CREA), our e-learning tool providing training on anti-corruption, bribery, 

managers.  Furthermore,  our  Employee  Code  of  Conduct  establishes  expectations 

and data protection topics. This continual training and communication ensure that 

for  all  staff  to  abide  by  the  values  of  openness,  trust,  teamwork,  and  acceptance 

understanding of our standards is always being reinforced. Compliance trainings 

of diversity in all their dealings with one another and with our tenants and other 

through  CREA  are  included  in  our Welcome  Days  for  new  employees,  as  well  as 

stakeholders. Adherence to the Code of Conduct is a mandatory requirement of all 

training on the use of our whistleblowing platform. Furthermore, employees are 

employee contracts.

Our Intranet Compliance Site

Since  2022,  we  have  a  compliance  site  on  our  Group  intranet,  where  the  above 

policies  are  available  to  all  our  employees.  This  is  a  major  step  towards  our 

overarching goal of unifying our internal policies across all our operating regions. 

Through the intranet platform, we can now also ensure that policies are available 

in a standard form to the whole organization, and that updates to these policies 

are rolled out immediately.

required to undergo annual refresher training on these policies, to reaffirm their 

commitment to these standards.

Compliance Monitoring

In addition to unifying our compliance approach across our operating locations, we 

want awareness and consideration of compliance issues to be straightforward and 

commonplace for our employees. To this end, in 2022 we introduced compliance 

ambassadors  in  our  regional  offices,  to  serve  as  first  contact  points  for  staff  on 

compliance subjects. These have currently been embedded in our UK and Cyprus 

Our intranet page and our publicly available website also support the measures

our employees view our company, and if, and how, we need to make improvements. 

We monitor the effectiveness of our compliance framework by tracking the number 

of compliance violations. We continue to carefully analyze the evolving market and 

regulatory  environment  in  conjunction  with  further  appropriate  development  of 

internal structures. This process considers a range of compliance issues including 

but not limited to corruption or bribery, conflicts of interest, insider trading, and 

money laundering. In 2023, zero relevant compliance cases were reported within 

the Group.

For  the  purpose  of  this  report,  Aroundtown  considers  a  compliance  case  to  be 

relevant  either  when  it  has  the  potential  to  materially  harm  the  reputation  of 

Aroundtown, will have a significant impact on an investor’s decision to invest in AT 

or if it may lead to a significant financial damage (of > €500 thousand). Any cases 

The  feedback  we  received  during  this  exercise  is  reflective  of  our  employee 

engagement programs and demonstrates the values we uphold at the Aroundtown 

Group. In the upcoming year, we aim to maintain this positive corporate culture.

During 2023, we were not subject to any convictions or fines resulting from the 

violation of anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws. We also did not experience any 

incidents of corruption or bribery, or any public legal cases in this regard.

of  Conduct  is  a  binding  requirement  for  our  business  partners  with  an  annual 

contractual volume above €5,000, with the exception of large corporations which 

have their own code of conduct – provided it is in line with our standards – and 

with  the  exception  of  organizations  that  operate  in  heavily-regulated  sectors. 

With the signing of our Business Partner Code of Conduct, these business partners 

demonstrate their commitment to adhering to the Code of Conduct.  Furthermore, 

in 2023 we enhanced this process by developing a Business Partner Questionnaire 

which assesses compliance with our Code of Conduct.  

To  fulfill  our  commitment  and  effectively  manage  the  risks  associated  with  our 

business  partners,  we  conduct  regular  onsite  checks,  particularly  focusing  on 

health and safety. Regarding payment terms, although we do not have a specific 

policy in place that addresses cases of late payments to our suppliers, we do define 

the payment terms at the beginning of our contracts to ensure we are on the same 

page with suppliers, and we do adhere to this agreement. 

Taking  into  account  adverse  impacts  on  human  rights  identified  in  the  Group’s 

materiality assessment and risk management process, which involves consideration 

of the risks associated with our suppliers according to their economic sectors and 

countries of operation, Aroundtown has identified and addressed potential risks in 

the areas of construction and refurbishment/maintenance of the business through 

a number of measures and processes. For instance, Aroundtown’s critical suppliers 

(those with a contract volume of > €250 thousand per annum) are required to sign 

the  Group’s  HR  questionnaire  and  during  project  implementation,  site  visits  are 

conducted by the Construction or Operation Departments on a quarterly basis to 

ensure compliance with our ESG Strategy.

DATA PROTECTION

We  have  a  deep  commitment  to  protecting  the  privacy  of  our  stakeholders’ 

 ● Availability: designing systems to minimize downtime

data,  which  goes  beyond  what  is  required  of  us  by  regulation.  We  believe  data 

protection is a key aspect sitting within our governance responsibilities, and every 

organization should have strong data protection governance in place. The volume 

of data handled in our business relationships increases every year, and we take the 

trust placed in us to protect the confidentiality of this data seriously.

Long-term Targets

 ● Identify risks proactively, to detect and eliminate weaknesses before they can 

become threats

 ● Embed a culture of awareness and vigilance throughout our staff, through 

consistent and regular training 

 ● Pursue continual improvement of the security of our digital systems

2024 Goals

 ● Pass our recertification audits for ISO 27001

 ● Introduce a new “on the job” learning format aimed at making information security 
more accessible by e.g., rolling out awareness campaigns across our offices  

The development of our Information Security and Privacy Strategy is continual, and 

is spearheaded by our in-house cybersecurity leads, who sit in on the board’s Risk 

Committee  meetings  to  reflect  data  security  considerations  in  our  top-level  risk 

management processes. Our ISO 27001 certification for our Information Security 

Management  System  (ISMS)  at  our  headquarters  in  Berlin  was  maintained  for  a 

third consecutive year in 2023. The scope of the certification applies to our head 

 ● Security: securing business information pertaining to Group operations

 ● PII: enforcing the security and confidentiality of processed personal information

 ● Regulations: satisfying regulatory (such as GDPR) and other information security 

requirements

 ● Awareness: training employees on how to identify threats and act according to 

Group guidelines

 ● Resilience: protecting our systems and networks as well as the data contained 

therein from malicious activities

 ● Information Assets: ensuring that all networks, systems and applications comply 

with confidentiality, integrity and availability

As  part  of  our  proactive  approach  to  risk  management,  we  have  conducted  28 

internal  reviews  at  our  office  branches  (local  and  international)  over  2022  and 

2023, and further reviews are already planned for 2024. These were designed to 

compare the effectiveness of measures at these offices to the implementation at 

our  operational  HQ,  to  ensure  that  the  application  of  our  procedures  is  unified 

across our business locations. The results demonstrated good levels of compliance 

across  the  organization,  and  opportunities  to  further  improve  practice  at  these 

sites were identified. Our goal is to continue to conduct more audits, so we can 

pinpoint potential weaknesses before they become threats.

In  2023,  as  planned,  we  restarted  our  in-person  welcome  days,  including  data 

protection as a key part of the agenda. We also conducted extensive technical crisis 

office, while the scope of the implementation applies to all local and international 

penetration  tests  alongside  risk  assessments. To  further  strengthen  our  security

In light of the shift in recent years to remote working spurred by the COVID-19 

pandemic, we have introduced new controls to ensure that all external connections 

are secure. Through a Privileged Access Management (PAM) System, we have added 

a  supplementary  security  layer  for  external  IT  service  providers  which  enforces 

MFA (multi-factor-authentication), session recording, least privileges and requires 

approval before each session. For our external business service providers, we have 

implemented a tool which checks the compliance of the operating systems that 

connect to ensure that they are well protected with a recent operating system, a 

malware solution and encryption capabilities. External service providers can only 

connect if all these standards are fulfilled. 

To ensure adequate security in our processes for saving and sharing information, all 

documents are labelled with an information security classification, from Public to 

Restricted, which requires password protection for the document, where applicable. 

To embed our data protection system across the Group, we place great importance 

on training and awareness for our staff, with all personnel being required to sign 

a  company  statement  of  their  commitment  to  data  protection.  Furthermore,  all 

our  employees  are  required  to  complete  video-based  training  modules  on  data 

protection, which are regularly developed to keep the training provided up to date. 

In 2022, we developed and filmed new awareness videos starring our employees 

to  make  the  training  more  relatable  and  understandable,  and  we  implemented 

a  photo-based  project  portraying  colleagues  in  fun  poses  edited  to  be  used  as 

“landing pages” for phishing campaigns. In 2024, we intend to continue creating 

highly personalized awareness campaigns covering further topics. 

Beyond initial training on our data protection procedures, we emphasize continued 

learning  and  awareness  efforts.  Furthermore,  Aroundtown’s  Standard  Operating 

Procedures (SOPs) set out expected courses of action for day-to-day activities, such as 

saving and storing information or handling requests for data. Permanent employees 

must  complete  mandatory  refresher  training  every  18  months  to  reinforce  their 

knowledge of these procedures and awareness of data protection risks.

Furthermore, we monitor potential security incidents and data protection breaches 

as  an  indicator  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  operational  procedures.  In  2023,  no 

such confirmed breaches or incidents were reported. In the event of any confirmed 

incident,  a  response  team  is  formed  to  immediately  investigate  the  matter  and 

recommend remedial actions to prevent a similar occurrence.

EPRA sBPR Data Preparation

As members of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA), we choose to 
report on our ESG impacts in accordance with the 3rd edition (2017) of the EPRA 
Sustainability Best Practice Recommendations (sBPR). In 2023, we received the EPRA 
sBPR  Gold  award  for  our  disclosure  for  the  seventh  time  consecutively. This year, 
in  preparation  for  the  first  compliance  window  of  the  CSRD,  we  have  reported  in 
alignment where possible with ESRS disclosure requirements according to our DMA.

Organizational Boundaries

The  information  and  data  in  this  report  covers  the  operations  of  Aroundtown 
SA,  spanning  our  direct  employees  and  commercial  portfolio. As  of  31  December 
2023,  our  Group  portfolio  (including  Grand  City  Properties  S.A.)  held  €25  billion 
of  investment  property  comprising  offices  (40%);  residential  (33%);  hotels  (21%); 
logistics/other and retail (6%). 

Information on our residential portfolio, which is owned by Grand City Properties S.A. 
(“GCP”) in which we hold a 63% stake (excluding the shares GCP holds in treasury), 
has been consolidated and the data is included in the scope of this report. However, 
GCP’s’ performance is also reported separately, and this information is published on 
the sustainability section of GCP’s website.

Landlord and Tenant Boundaries

We have followed the methodology followed in last year’s report for allocating 
energy  consumption  between  landlord-controlled  areas  and  tenant-controlled 
areas. In our 2019 baseline, we use a common area/total area ratio to apportion 
shared-service  heating  consumption  between  landlord  and  tenant  spaces, 
based on the floor area distribution found with the property types classification 
appendix  (3a)  of  the  GRESB  Real  Estate  Assessment  reference  guide12.  Thus, 
the  whole  building  consumption  is  attributed  to  landlord  or  tenant  control  in 
proportion to the ratio of shared spaces to tenant areas expected for the property. 
Correspondingly, emissions from this heating are attributed to Scope 1 and 2 or 
to Scope 3 in the same proportion. For electricity, the consumption for tenant-
controlled  areas  is  estimated  based  on  industry  standard  energy  benchmarks, 

namely those of CIBSE. At present, we collect and/or estimate Scope 3 emissions 
data relating to tenant energy consumption. We look to expand this emissions 
data boundary in future years.

Therefore, the energy consumption and the corresponding CO2 emissions will now 
represent  the  entire  building  area  i.e.,  of  both  landlord  and  tenant-controlled 
area. We recognize that under an operational control approach, the allocation of 
CO2 emissions between Scope 1 or 2 and Scope 3 is dependent on the metering 
and sub-metering arrangement in place between tenants and landlords. However, 
to  create  an  accurate  representation  of  the  entire  building,  we  have  classified 
indirect  emissions  by  area  apportioned  between  landlord  and  tenant  spaces,  as 
described in the methods above.

Coverage

Absolute and like-for-like portfolio environmental data relates to the assets in the 
operational  control  portfolio,  which  is  a  subset  of  the  Organizational  Boundaries 
discussed above, defined as assets the company directly manages building operations 
such as choice of energy provider. The like-for-like subset contains all the properties 
for  which  we  received  environmental  reporting  data  for  the  full  two-year  period 
from January 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2023.

Actual environmental performance data is only reported on assets for which we have 
operational control and for which we can collect utilities data. On an absolute basis, 
this included a net lettable area of 6,337,823 m² out of a total operational control 
portfolio covering a net lettable area of 7,265,365 m² (excluding assets held for sale 
and properties under development) at the end of December 31st, 2023. A breakdown of 
the portfolio net lettable area based on asset types are as follows: office – 2,770,258 
m²,  retail –  183,760  m²,  others  including  logistics –  686,791  m².  During  2023,  we 
continued to improve the quality of our environmental data collection and are now 
able to report like-for-like data from approximately 68% of our total managed assets 
portfolio.

Further information relating to maximum coverage on an absolute and like-for-like 
basis per utility type is provided within our data tables.

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report117

Data relating to our employees covers all direct employees employed by Aroundtown 
in  Germany  (who  represent  80%  of  our  European  workforce),  including  part  time 
and  temporary  workers,  as  well  as  our  international  employees.  Following  the 
consolidation  with  GCP  in  2021,  our  employee  data  also  includes  GCP  data,  but 
excludes contractors and those not directly employed by us.

Voluntary  green  building  certifications  (Cert-Tot)  are  discussed  in  absolute  terms. 
100% of the Dutch office portfolio is certified, 36% of the total office portfolio is 
certified  and  21%  of  the  commercial  portfolio  is  certified  with  BREEAM.  In  our 
German portfolio, with the first office assets certified, we expect gradual progress in 
the coming periods. We are also analyzing certification options in our hotel portfolio.

Reporting Period

All  data  relates  to  our  financial year,  which  coincides  with  the  calendar year,  and 
consequently runs from January 1st to December 31st of the year under review.

Estimation of Landlord-Obtained Utility Consumption

1.   Measured  data  for  the  reporting  year  were  not  fully  available  in  time  for 
publication. In instances where the available heating data is not representative, 
estimations were calculated based on known consumption from other periods, 
following  the  ratio-based  heating-degree-days  normalization  method.  In  the 
case  of  electricity,  the  consumption  was  extrapolated  based  on  the  weighted 
arithmetic mean of other known periods. In some instances, this was not possible 
for  heating.  Here  we  calculated  an  estimation  by  extrapolating  expected 
heating consumption according to the EPC rating of the building and weather 
normalization was not performed.

2.   Data is only available for a proportion of units under our management control, 
for example regarding recycled waste. In this instance we have extrapolated data 
for the units where we are able to collect complete data given the similarities 
between our units and those which are tenanted.

We have reported the percentage of estimation that this represents per utility type 
in our data tables.

Furthermore,  we  have  disclosed  the  proportion  of  overall  consumption  that  our 
estimation  of  tenant  consumption  represents,  according  to  our  methodology 
described in the section ‘Landlord and Tenant Boundaries’.

Regarding  only  landlord-obtained  utility  consumption,  as  per  the  EPRA  sBPR 
requirements, we have detailed the extent of estimations below:

 ● Electricity: 76% of landlord-obtained consumption is based on available utility 

consumption data, with 24% estimated. 

 ● Heating: 92% of landlord-obtained consumption is based on available utility 

consumption data, with the remaining 8% estimated.

The total volume of waste is based on the contracted waste volumes at properties 
where this information was available. No additional estimation occurred. The total 
proportion  of  recycled  waste  is  based  on  household  averages  published  by  the 
German environmental protection authority which represents the highest authority 
in the country.

Our own office utilities consumption is estimated based on the proportion of the 
total  rental  floor  area  occupied  by  Aroundtown  as  we  do  not  occupy  the  whole 
building and no sub-meters exist.

Units of Measurement and Normalization

Utilities  data  are  reported  based  on  absolute  consumption  measured  in  kWh 
(energy), t CO2e (GHG emissions), m3 (water) and m3 and tons (waste).

GHG emissions are reported using location-based conversion factors published by 
the German Environmental Protection Association.

Where consumption is normalized, we calculate intensity indicators using floor area 
(m2) for whole buildings, including tenant areas. Since we are now estimating the 
tenant  consumption,  we  believe  that  our  numerator  and  denominator  provide  a 
representative intensity figure.

Employee coverage rates are expressed as a percentage of AT’s total direct employees 
at year end.

 ● Accident/Injury Rate = Number of reportable injuries / Total hours worked 

 ● Lost-Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) = Number of injuries / Million hours worked

 ● Lost Day Rate = Number of days lost due to workplace injuries / Number of 

working hours 

 ● Absentee Rate = Number of days absent due to illness / Total number of working days

 ● Work-related Fatalities = Total number of work-related fatalities

 ● Number of Accidents = Number of Injuries

 ● Rate of Accidents = Injury rate 

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report118

Accidents and injuries are tracked as the same metric, and therefore accident rate is 
classified as the same metric as injury rate. 

Segmental Analysis (By Property Type, Geography)

Segmental  analysis  by  geography  is  not  relevant  for  our  portfolio.  Our  assets  are 
primarily  located  within  Germany,  the  Netherlands  and  London,  and  therefore  in 
the same climatic zone. Segmental analysis is instead provided by asset type and is 
consistent with our financial reporting.

Disclosure on Own Offices

Our own occupied office consumption is excluded from our portfolio data as we are 
a tenant in the building.

Restatements of Information

 ● In 2023, the Group updated its definition of the Operational Control portfolio to 
include all assets it directly manages in its German and Dutch portfolios, and to 

exclude hotels. This has resulted in a restatement of the EPC coverage figures 

with the denominator now being calculated according to the new operational 

control portfolio definition.

 ● Renewable share of energy: a technical error was identified for 2022 figures, where 
an existing contract for renewable energy for one energy type was incorrectly 

applied to all energy contracts for that asset. This has now been corrected to tagging 

renewable contracts more granularly to contracts for each specific energy type.

 ● Injury rate: 2022 figures for Injury Rate have been restated due to an error in last 
year’s reporting, where an internal metric using number of Full-Time Employees 

Berlin

(FTEs) as the denominator was reported. In 2023, we updated the methodology 

as prescribed by the EPRA sBPR guidelines, which uses total number of working 

hours as the denominator.

 ● Gender Pay Gap: The Management remuneration ratio for 2022 has been restated, 
as the ratio disclosed in 2022 was calculated based on employees in Germany 

only. The updated figure reflects all locations.

AT further breaks down its net rental income into the recurring long-term net rental 

income and net rental income generated by properties marked for disposal. As AT 

intends to dispose the held-for-sale properties, AT views their contribution as non-

recurring and therefore presents their contributions in a separate line item. The net

in 2023, decreasing compared to €18 million in 2022 mostly due to the smaller 

disposals volume and held-for-sale balance. As a result, the recurring net rental 

income in 2023 totaled €1,180 million, compared to €1,204 million in 2022. Recurring 

net rental income also includes immaterial rental income from properties classified 

as development rights & invest which is excluded in the run rate.

AT recorded revenues of €1,603 million in 2023 (“FY 2023”), flat compared to €1,610 

million generated in 2022 (“FY 2022”). Net rental income represents the largest 

portion of revenues and totaled €1,193 million in 2023, 2% lower compared to €1,222 

million in 2022. The decline in net rental income due to €2.1 billion of net disposals 

closed since the start of 2022 was partially offset by the like-for-like rental growth of 

3.2% in 2023, of which 3.6% is from in-place rent like-for-like and more than offset 

the negative 0.4% from occupancy like-for-like. The commercial portfolio continued 

to benefit from significant CPI adjustments and step-up rents and recorded like-

for-like rental growth of 3.0%. The residential portfolio continued to benefit from a 

significant supply and demand imbalance resulting in a further reduction of vacancy 

to a historic new low level and a like-for-like net rental income growth of 3.4%.

AT generated operating and other income of €410 million in 2023, higher by 6% 

compared to €388 million in 2022. Operating income is mostly related to ancillary 

expenses that are reimbursed by tenants such as utility costs (heating, energy, water, 

insurance, etc.) and charges for services provided to tenants (cleaning, security, etc.). 

The increase in operating and other income was mainly due to cost inflation which 

accordingly also resulted in an increase of recoverable property operating expenses. 

Other income also includes €39 million income from vendor loans and loans-to-

own investments. Reimbursable utility costs including heating, energy and water and 

external service expenses were the largest drivers of growth. However, in line with 

the slowdown in inflation, the increase in these expenses slowed down throughout 

2023. The increase was partially offset by the smaller portfolio size due to disposals.

(694.9)

Property operating expenses amounted to €638 million in 2023, lower by 8% compared 

to €695 million in 2022. The decline in property operating expenses was mainly due to 

the lower extraordinary expenses for uncollected hotel rents and the overall smaller 

portfolio size, partially offset by cost inflation in ancillary expenses and purchased 

services that correlated with the increase in operating income. However, the cost 

inflation has softened in H2 2023. Excluding the impact from lower extraordinary 

expenses for uncollected hotel rents, property operating expenses were €605 million in 

2023 and decreased by 2% year-over-year. The largest component of property operating 

expenses are ancillary expenses and purchased services which are mainly recoverable 

from tenants and include utility costs (heating, energy, water, insurance, etc.), charges 

for services provided to tenants (cleaning, security, etc.) and other services contracted 

in relation to operations of properties. Operating personnel expenses amounted to 

€63 million in 2023, higher compared to €59 million in 2022 as headcount remained 

stable, but wage inflation resulted in an overall increase. Other operating costs include 

various expenses such as marketing, letting and legal fees, transportation, travel, 

communications, insurance, IT and VAT. These costs have decreased mainly as a result of 

lower provisions for uncollected hotel rents, the smaller portfolio and greater efficiency 

in these items, offsetting the impacts of cost inflation.

Property operating expenses also include non-recurring extraordinary expenses for 

uncollected hotel rents totaling €33 million in 2023, lower than the €75 million in 

2022. These extraordinary expenses reduced during 2023 as the hospitality industry 

continued its recovery, witnessing a steady increase in the occupancy and average daily 

room rate throughout the year.

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ ReportMAINTENANCE AND CAPEX

AT recorded maintenance and refurbishment expenses in the amount of €49 
million in 2023, lower by 4% compared to €51 million in 2022. The decline was 
mostly a result of the smaller portfolio size due to disposals, partially offset by cost 
inflation. The maintenance expense ratio over the average investment property value 
(including the properties held for sale) remained relatively stable at 0.18% in 2023.

AT continuously reviews its portfolio to assess its capex needs to maintain the high 
quality of its assets, increase the attractiveness of its portfolio to support the letting 
process and address the requirements of both existing and prospective tenants. In 
2023, AT invested €335 million in capex, reflecting a ratio of 1.2% over average 
investment property value (including properties held for sale), compared to €408 
million and 1.4% in 2022. Due to the prevailing market conditions, strengthening 
the liquidity and balance sheet has been an important objective for AT and thus, AT 
carried out projects more selectively, resulting in the lower capex spent in 2023. A 
lower volume of projects was partially offset by an increase in construction costs.

AT divides its capex into three different main categories. These include Expansion 
capex, Tenant improvements and Other capex. Expansion capex includes activities 
that are targeted at creating additional income drivers or significant value creation 
potential which may result in additional lettable space or significant enhancement 
of the existing space. These selective projects are mostly major refurbishments but 
also conversions and new-builds and they are mainly done at low risk with high pre-
let ratios. Expansion capex additionally includes GCP’s pre-letting modifications and 
development capex. Expansion capex projects represented €122 million or 36% of 
total capex in 2023, compared to €197 million or 48% in 2022, reducing in absolute 
and percentage terms mainly because of greater selectiveness in undertaking large 
projects with substantial investment requirements. Tenant improvements include 
capex for fit-out works that are targeted at retaining existing tenants and/or 
attracting new tenants, supporting the quality of the tenant structure and extending 
the average lease term. This category represented €96 million or 29% of capex in 
2023, compared to €96 million or 24% in 2022, stable in absolute terms but higher in 
percentage terms due to lower capex in 2023. Other capex includes ongoing capital 
expenditures that are targeted at sustaining the high quality of assets as well as 
improving sustainability standards to reduce the energy and CO2 consumption and 
CO2 tax, benefitting AT and its tenants. These can be green installations such as solar 
panels, combined heat and power engines and electric vehicle charging stations as 
well as green refurbishments such as roof and lighting replacements. This item also 
includes GCP’s repositioning capex. Other capex accounted for €117 million or 35% 

127

of total capex in 2023, compared to €114 million or 28% in 2022, increasing mostly 
due to GCP’s higher repositioning capex. The absolute amount remained stable year-
over-year excluding GCP’s repositioning capex, at €41 million in 2023 compared to 
€40 million in 2022 as cost inflation offset the smaller portfolio size.

Aroundtown conducts an impairment test once a year or when there is an indication 

of impairment of an asset. The impairment amount reflects the amount by which the 

carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 

In 2023, AT recorded impairment of goodwill in the amount of €137 million, compared 

to €404 million in 2022. €604 million is attributed to the goodwill on TLG and 

€540 million is attributed to the goodwill on GCP. The goodwill is mainly attributed 

to deferred taxes and the balance was reduced due to revaluation losses and the 

reduced portfolio size following disposal activity. All EPRA NAV KPI’s exclude the 

goodwill so any change in the goodwill balance has no impact on these KPI’s.

€970 million in 2023, increasing by 5% compared to €927 million in 2022 due to 

the higher collection rate in hotels.

AT’s adjusted EBITDA accounts for other adjustments in the amount of €5.3 million 

in 2023 compared to €7.4 million in 2022 related mainly to non-cash expenses 

for employees’ share incentive plans. AT conservatively does not include the 

contributions from commercial properties marked for disposal as they are intended 

to be sold and therefore, their contributions are non-recurring. This adjustment 

amounted to €10.0 million in 2023, lower compared to €12.4 million in 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure used to evaluate the operational 

results of the Group, derived by deducting from the EBITDA non-operational and/or 

non-recurring items such as revaluation and capital gains, extraordinary expenses, 

and other adjustments. Additionally, in order to mirror the recurring operational 

results of the Group, the results from investments in equity-accounted investees 

is subtracted as this also include the Group’s share in non-operational and non-

recurring results generated by these investees. Instead, to reflect their operational 

earnings, the Group includes in its adjusted EBITDA its share in the adjusted EBITDA 

generated by investments where the Group has a significant influence in accordance 

with its effective holding rate over the period.

of joint venture positions and excludes the share in minorities’ operational profits. 

Furthermore, AT includes the extraordinary expenses for uncollected hotel rents 

and makes an adjustment related to assets held for sale. 

In addition, AT provides the FFO II, which is an additional key performance indicator 

used in the real estate industry to evaluate the recurring operational profits 

including the disposal gains during the relevant period.

AT generated an FFO I amounting to €332 million in 2023, lower by 8% compared 

to €363 million in 2022. The decline was mostly due to the impact from disposals 

and cost inflation, higher perpetual notes attribution due to the partial impact 

from the coupon step-ups for notes with a first call date in 2023, and higher 

finance expenses from new debt and the impact of the higher interest rates. These 

factors were partially offset by the lower provision for uncollected hotel rents, 

like-for-like rental growth of 3.2% and a reduction in contribution to minorities 

mainly due to the higher holding rate in GCP. As of December 2023, AT’s stake in 

GCP was 63%, excluding the treasury shares, from 60% as of December 2022. The 

contribution from commercial properties held for sale, which is excluded from the 

FFO, amounted to €7.1 million in 2023 compared to €7.8 million in 2022. FFO I per 

share amounted to €0.30 in 2023, 9% lower compared to €0.33 in 2022. 

AT recorded an FFO II of €449 million in 2023, declining by 37% compared to €714 

million in 2022 mainly due to the lower volume of disposals at a lower margin in 

the period. In 2023, AT closed over €1.2 billion of disposals at an 11% margin over 

cost compared to €1.6 billion at a 29% margin over cost values in 2022.

liquid assets, AT’s liquidity position reached €3.0 billion at the end of December 2023, 

representing 21% of the total debt position.

€772 million of net cash was provided from operating activities in 2023, lower by 2% 

compared to €788 million. The like-for-like rental growth and higher rent collection 

was offset by the impact of disposals and cost inflation, as well as a lower amount of 

cash dividends received from joint venture positions and a higher working capital as a 

result of timing differences between the consumption and settlement of recoverable 

costs.

€608 million of net cash was received from investing activities in 2023, higher 

compared to €409 million in 2022, as a lower volume of disposals was offset by 

a lower volume of acquisitions and capex and repayment from loans-to-own and 

vendor loans. €970 million of cash was received from disposals and repayment of 

vendor loans – net of new vendor loans granted, transaction costs, and tax – partially 

offset by ca. €360 million of net cash used mainly for capex and investment in 

associates and others, net of repayment from loans-to-own.

€1,052 million of net cash was used in financing activities in 2023, lower compared 

to €1,764 million that was used in 2022. The main uses of cash in 2023 were the

of the €100 million Series S schuldschein and repayment of approx. €85 million in 

bank debt mainly tied to assets that were disposed. Further uses of cash included the

Total assets amounted to €33.6 billion at year-end 2023, lower by 10% compared to 

€37.3 billion at year-end 2022. The decline was mainly due to the negative property 

revaluations, impairment of goodwill and utilization of the large cash balance for 

deleveraging activities, partially offset by new bank debt raised and operational 

profits. Non-current assets totaled €28.9 billion as of December 2023, down by 11% 

compared to €32.5 billion as of December 2022.

(b) Investment property

Investment property represents the largest item under non-current assets and 

amounted to €24.6 billion at year-end 2023, 12% lower as compared to €28.0 billion 

at year-end 2022. The decline was mainly due to negative property revaluations, 

movement of investment property into assets held for sale, and disposals of 

investment property. As of December 2023, AT got its full portfolio revalued by 

independent and qualified third-party appraisers in order to reflect the most updated 

market environment. This resulted in a like-for-like value decline for the full year 

of 11%, or 10% after adding back capex, due to higher cap rates and discount rates 

which were impacted by the higher interest rates, partially offset by the like-for-like 

rent growth supported by the indexation-driven increases on commercial leases and 

strong demand in the residential sector. Since the end of June 2022, AT recorded a 

total valuation decline of 14%. 

Throughout 2023, AT closed over €1.2 billion in disposals, of which €0.7 billion 

was signed in 2023 and €0.5 billion was signed in 2022. AT signed disposals in the 

amount of €0.9 billion in 2023 including the signed disposals that are not closed yet 

at year-end 2023. The disposals were across all asset types and multiple locations, 

highlighting AT’s ability to sell despite the difficult market conditions. Signed and 

not closed disposals will further improve the strong liquidity position. In addition, 

over €200 million of new investment properties were added during the year. These 

were previously held through a joint venture structure and loans-to-own and during 

the year AT increased its stake and obtained control. These investment properties 

are composed mainly of attractive leisure hotels with additional upside potential.

(c) Goodwill and intangible assets

Goodwill and intangible assets amounted to €1.2 billion at year-end 2023, lower 

compared to €1.3 billion at year-end 2022, due to an impairment as explained under 

Impairment of goodwill above. As of December 2023, goodwill in the amount of €604 

million is related to the TLG takeover and €540 million is related to the consolidation 

of GCP. All EPRA NAV KPI’s exclude the goodwill so any change in the goodwill 

balance has no impact on these KPI’s.

(d) Investment in equity-accounted investees

Investment in equity-accounted investees amounted to €1.1 billion at year-end 2023, 

lower compared to €1.3 billion at year-end 2022. This line item represents the Group’s 

long-term investment in joint ventures in which the Group has a significant influence, 

but which are not consolidated. The largest investment in this item as at year-end 

2023, which represents approx. 45% of the total balance of this item, is AT’s stake 

in Globalworth, a leading publicly listed office landlord in Central Eastern European 

markets, mainly in Warsaw and Bucharest. The holding rate in Globalworth is slightly 

above 30% as of December 2023, indirectly held through a joint venture with CPI 

Property Group S.A. The remaining balance of equity-accounted investees mainly 

include several positions in real estate properties and investment in real estate related 

funds specialized among others in Proptech, digitalization and technology in the real 

estate sector, as well as yielding real estate loan funds, which work in a similar profile to 

the Group’s loans-to-own investments and may provide future access to attractive deals, 

and additional investments in co-working and renewable energy projects. The decline 

was mainly due the negative valuation results of these investees and consolidation of 

some previously held investment property through joint venture structures.  

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report127

(e) Other non-current assets

Other non-current assets are mainly comprised of vendor loans that are related to 

disposals, long-term financial investments and loans-to-own assets.

Vendor loans support the facilitation of the transaction and were given to several 

selected buyers of assets that were sold. The loans generally have a maturity of 1-3 

years and are expected to be paid in installments from 2024-2026. The loans are 

secured against the property sold at an initial LTV in the range of 40%-70% at the 

time of disposal and in case of default gives AT the ability to get the asset back with 

The other non-current assets also include ca. €65 million of tenant deposits which 

are used as a security for rent payments, ca. €50 million of receivables due to revenue 

straight-lining effect arising from rent-free periods granted to tenants, long-term 

minority positions in real estate properties and other receivables.

Furthermore, non-current assets include long-term derivative financial assets, 

deferred tax assets, and advance payments and deposits which mainly refer to 

advance payments for signed deals, deposits for deals in the due diligence phase 

and deposits for committed capex programs.

a penalty to the defaulted buyer (through a process involving a receiver). The balance 

Current assets totaled €4.7 billion at year-end 2023, lower compared to €4.9 billion 

as of December 2023 is €0.65 billion, compared to €0.5 billion at year-end 2022. The 

increase is due to granting new vendor loans in connection with disposals closed 

in 2023, net of repayments during 2023. As of December 2023, the average interest 

rate of the vendor loans is ca. 5%. The interest rate increased from 3.4% at year-end 

2022 due to scheduled step-ups, variable components as well as due to contractual 

extensions at higher rates. The future liquidity coming from the repayments of the 

vendor loans will reduce the Group’s leverage as they are conservatively not included 

in the leverage calculation.

Loans-to-own assets are asset-backed and yielding loans where, under certain 

conditions, the default of the loan will enable the Group to take over the underlying 

asset at a material discount. Loans-to-own assets were provided to a diverse number 

of property owners and sourced through the Group’s wide deal sourcing network 

established over the years. As of December 2023, the loans-to-own balance amounted

Other current liabilities were €1.0 billion at year-end 2023, lower compared to over

current liabilities is trade and other payables, which mainly comprise of pre-payments 

for ancillary services received from tenants that are correlated with the operating 

costs receivables under current assets. Other current liabilities also include tax 

payables, provisions for other liabilities and accrued expenses and other liabilities 

in properties held for sale which are not included above. Current assets cover current 

liabilities by 3 times.

1)  including loans and borrowings under held for sale
2)  excluding current liability items that are included in the lines above

Total liabilities amounted to €18.4 billion at year-end 2023, lower by 6% compared 

to €19.5 billion at year-end 2022. The reduction was mainly due to debt repayments, 

mostly from bond buybacks at discount, and lower deferred tax liabilities due to the 

property devaluations, partially offset by new bank debt raised. Total debt from bank 

loans and bonds amounted to €14.2 billion at year-end 2023, 4% lower compared 

to €14.8 billion at year-end 2022. The decline was mainly due to the repurchase of 

€1.3 billion in nominal value, mostly near-term bonds at an average discount of 20%, 

reducing leverage and refinancing risk. AT also redeemed the €100 million Series S 

schuldschein and repaid approx. €85 million in bank debt mainly tied to assets that 

were disposed. These measures were partially offset by ca. €900 million in new bank 

debt drawn at an average margin of 1.4% and an average maturity of over 7 years. 

As a result of these pro-active liability management exercises and large liquidity 

position, debt maturities until mid-2026 are covered, up from end-of-2025 in Dec 

2022, by the current liquidity and expected proceeds from signed disposals that are 

not closed and vendor loans. AT has additional liquidity sources from undrawn credit 

facilities that mature mostly in 2025 and unencumbered investment properties of 

€17.9 billion which allow it to raise further secured financing.

Deferred tax liabilities amounted to €2.1 billion at year-end 2023, lower by 21% 

compared to €2.7 billion at year-end 2022. The decrease was mainly due to negative 

revaluations and disposals. Deferred tax liabilities are non-cash items that are

dividends and operational profitability. Aroundtown’s leverage and financial metrics 

retain a very significant headroom to bond covenants.

The Group’s high operational profitability and financial discipline resulted in a high 

ICR of 4.2x in 2023, lower compared to 5.2x in 2022, mainly due to higher finance 

expenses. An unencumbered investment property ratio of 74% (by rent) with a total 

value of €17.9 billion (excluding held for sale assets) as of year-end 2023 highlights 

the Group’s financial flexibility and provides additional liquidity potential, along with 

undrawn revolving credit facilities.

not to call the AT perpetual note with a first call date in January 2024. All these 

decisions were taken after having considered all available options and were mainly 

made because the rates of a potential new issuance were significantly above the reset 

rates of the notes. The reset coupons were adjusted at the respective call dates to 

7.08% for AT’s January 2023 perpetual note, 6.33% for GCP’s January 2023 perpetual 

note, 7.75% for AT’s July 2023 USD perpetual note, and 5.90% for GCP’s October 2023 

Total equity amounted to €15.1 billion at year-end 2023, lower by 15% compared to 

perpetual note. After the reporting period, the coupon rate for AT’s January 2024

considered as shareholders’ equity under IFRS accounting rules and had already been 

included in the share count upon issuance. Given the macro-economic uncertainty 

and volatility in the first half of 2023, the Board of Directors of both Aroundtown and 

GCP decided not to recommend a dividend payment for 2022 to be distributed in 

2023 at the respective annual general meetings of both companies. Non-controlling 

interests declined to €2.7 billion at year-end 2023 from €3.5 billion at year-end 2023 

mostly due to the loss attributable to non-controlling interests mainly from property 

devaluations and the increased stake in GCP to 63% (excluding treasury shares) at 

year-end 2023 from 60% as at year-end 2022 via acquisition of shares.

The perpetual notes balance amounted to €4.8 billion at year-end 2023, stable 

compared to €4.7 billion at year-end 2022. Following IFRS accounting treatment, 

perpetual notes are classified as equity as they do not have a repayment date, are 

subordinated to debt, do not have default rights nor covenants and coupon payments 

are deferrable at the Company’s discretion. The perpetual notes are 100% equity 

under IFRS regardless of whether they are called or not and therefore have no impact

EPRA NAV KPI’S

The European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) provides three key Net Asset Value 
(NAV) metrics designed to provide stakeholders with the most relevant information 
on the fair value of the Group’s assets and liabilities. With the evolving nature of their 
business models, real estate companies progressed into actively managed entities, 
engaging in non-property operating activities, actively recycling capital and accessing 
capital markets for balance sheet financing. In line with these developments, EPRA 
has provided the market with the following three NAV KPI’s: EPRA Net Reinstatement 
Value (EPRA NRV), EPRA Net Tangible Assets (EPRA NTA) and EPRA Net Disposal Value 
(EPRA NDV).

The EPRA NRV’s purpose is to reflect the value of net assets required to re-build a 
company on a long-term basis assuming entities do not sell assets. Therefore, balance 
sheet items that are not expected to crystallize in normal circumstances such as the 
fair value movements of financial derivatives and deferred tax liabilities are added back 

to the equity. Additionally, gross purchasers’ costs are added back since this metric is 

aiming to reflect what would be needed to recreate a company through the investment 

markets based on its capital financing structure.

The EPRA NTA aims to reflect the tangible value of a company’s net assets assuming 

entities buy and sell assets, crystallizing certain levels of unavoidable deferred tax 

liabilities. Therefore, EPRA NTA excludes intangible assets and goodwill, and adds back 

the portion of deferred tax liabilities that is not expected to crystallize as a result of 

long-term hold strategy.

The EPRA NDV provides the shareholders with the value under the scenario that a 

company’s assets are sold or its liabilities are not held until maturity. For this purpose, it 

assumes that deferred taxes, financial instruments and other adjustments are calculated 

to the full extent of their liability, net of any resulting tax.

Development rights & Invest portfolio:

net of the associated deferred tax income, partially offset by the positive operational 

result, the lower other financial expenses mainly due to bond buybacks at discount, 

and the reduction of minorities in GCP. The reduction in goodwill had no impact on 

these KPI’s as goodwill is excluded from the equity, thus any change is neutral.  

EPRA NRV

The EPRA NRV amounted to €9.9 billion or €9.1 per share as of year-end 2023, both 

declining by 19% compared to €12.3 billion or €11.2 per share as of year-end 2022.

EPRA NTA

As an additional value creation driver, Aroundtown pursues a selective development 

program which is designed to unlock further potential through identifying and selling 

development rights at high gains or developing at low risks with high pre-let ratios. 

Since the decision is based on an opportunistic basis, Aroundtown conservatively 

does not add back deferred tax liabilities related to these assets.

lower by 28% compared to €10.5 or €9.6 per share at year-end 2022. The decline was 

further impacted by a lower difference between the higher net fair value of debt and 

the book value of debt amount as a result of net debt repayments and lower market 

volatility in 2023.

Assets held for sale are properties which are expected to be disposed within the next 

12 months. Conservatively, deferred taxes on these properties are not added back, 

although Aroundtown has a track record of benefitting from a lower tax ratio for its 

disposals due to the disposal structure.

Aroundtown actively seeks to reduce the share of retail assets in its portfolio on an 

opportunistic basis. Therefore, deferred tax liabilities related to these properties are

EPRA EARNINGS

Year ended December 31,

EPRA Earnings is intended to serve as a key indicator of the Group’s underlying 

135

operational profits for the year in the context of a European real estate company. 

Given AT’s strategic joint venture investments, the proportional share in these joint 

venture investments’ EPRA Earnings for the year is included in accordance with 

the average holding rate for the period. As Funds from Operations (FFO I) is the 

widely-recognized industry standard KPI for operational performance, an additional 

reconciliation from the EPRA Earnings to the FFO I is provided above.

EPRA Earnings amounted to €439 million in 2023, flat compared to €439 million in 

2022. Higher finance expenses and finance-related costs, the impact from disposals 

and cost inflation were offset by the like-for-like rental growth, lower extraordinary 

expenses for uncollected hotel rents, lower operating costs and reduced minorities. 

EPRA Earnings per share totaled €0.40 in 2023, also flat compared to €0.40 per share 

in 2022.

The EPRA LTV is a metric that aims to assess the leverage of shareholder equity 

EPRA LTV was 60.8% at year-end 2023, higher compared to 55.4% at year-end 2022. 

within a real estate company. The main difference between EPRA LTV and the Group’s 
calculated LTV is the wider categorization of liabilities and assets with the largest 

The increase was primarily due to the negative property revaluations, partially 

offset by the operational profits and deleveraging activities such as disposals, bond 

impact coming from the inclusion of perpetual notes as debt, inclusion of financial 

buybacks at discount, suspension of dividends and repayments from loans-to-own 

assets in the net assets and proportionate consolidation adjustments. Under IFRS, the 

and vendor loans. 

Group’s perpetual notes are considered as equity as they do not have a maturity date, 

are subordinated to all debt types and do not carry covenants. As a result, the Group 

views its LTV metric as a better measure of leverage, as it more closely matches the 

LTV under its debt covenants.

The EPRA NIY was 4.0% at year-end 2023, higher compared to 3.5% at year-end 2022, 

mainly due to lower portfolio values driven by negative revaluations, partially offset 

by disposal of assets with higher-than-average yields. The increase in in-place and 

market rents and a lower cost margin, reflected in a lower EPRA cost ratio, supported 

the increase in the EPRA NIY. Accordingly, the EPRA ‘Topped-up’ NIY increased to 4.1% 

at year-end 2023, compared to 3.5% at year-end 2022.

EPRA Vacancy is an operational measure that calculates a real estate company’s 

economic vacancy rate as based on the prevailing market rental rates. It is calculated 

by dividing the market rental value of the vacant space in the portfolio by the 

annualized rental value of the portfolio, including vacancy at market rents. The 

EPRA Vacancy including JV further includes AT’s share in joint venture investments, 

including its holding in Globalworth, the leading publicly listed office landlord in 

Central and Eastern European markets, mainly in Warsaw and Bucharest.

EPRA Vacancy was 7.9% at year-end 2023, higher compared to 7.6% at year-end 

2022. The small increase was mainly due to negative like-for-like occupancy, partially 

offset by disposal of assets with higher-than-average vacancy. Correspondingly, EPRA 

Vacancy including JV increased to 8.1% at year-end 2023, up from 7.8% at year-end 

2022. Aroundtown has observed an increase in market ERV’s due to inflation driven 

indexations.

The EPRA Cost Ratios provide an overview of a company’s

operating cost structure and provide for increased comparability

across companies. The cost ratios are derived by dividing the 

141

administrative expenses and property operating expenses 

(including non-recoverable service charges) by the net rental 

income. The ratio is calculated both including and excluding the 

direct vacancy costs. Given the strategic importance of its joint 

venture investments, AT includes in its calculations their relative 

contributions at the average holding rate during the year.

The EPRA cost ratios amounted to 23.0% including direct 

vacancy costs and 20.8% excluding direct vacancy costs in 2023, 

lower compared to 27.8% and 25.7% in 2022 respectively. The 

lower cost ratio is the result of efficiency gains, like-for-like 

net rental growth, lower extraordinary expenses for uncollected 

hotel rents, and disposal of assets with a higher-than-average 

cost structure. Correspondingly, cost ratios excluding the 

extraordinary expenses for uncollected hotel rents amounted 

to 20.4% including direct vacancy costs and 18.3% excluding 

direct vacancy costs in 2023, both lower compared to 22.0% and

Funds from Operations I (FFO I) is an industry standard 

performance indicator for evaluating operational recurring 

profits of a real estate firm. Aroundtown calculates FFO I by 

deducting from the Adjusted EBITDA before JV contribution, 

the Finance expenses, Current tax expenses, Contribution to 

minorities and adds back Adjustments related to assets held 

for sale. Adjustments related to assets held for sale refers 

to finance expenses and current tax expenses related to 

assets held for sale. Contribution to minorities additionally 

include the minority share in GCP’s FFO I (starting from July 

1, 2021) and the minority share in TLG’s FFO I excluding 

which excluded the Extraordinary expenses for uncollected rent. 

Starting from FY 2022, this line item is not shown in the table

FFO I of joint venture positions in accordance with the holding 

rate over the period to reflect the recurring operational profits 

generated by those investments. This item is labelled as 

Contribution of joint ventures’ FFO I. Prior to the third quarter of 

2021, this item was mostly attributed to Aroundtown’s share 

in GCP’s FFO I, however, starting from July 1, 2021, GCP is 

consolidated in Aroundtown’s financial accounts. Aroundtown 

created Extraordinary expenses for uncollected hotel rents. 

Therefore, Aroundtown’s FFO I includes these expenses.

FFO I per share is calculated by dividing the  FFO I by the 

Weighted average basic shares which excludes the shares held 

in treasury.

In FY 2020 and FY 2021, Aroundtown additionally showed

standards which includes Aroundtown’s share in TLG’s and 

GCP’s relevant real estate transfer taxes (RETT). Following the 

consolidation of GCP, the goodwill recognized in relation 

to  GCP  became relevant for EPRA  NRV  calculations.  EPRA 

NRV per share is calculated by dividing the EPRA NRV by the 

Number of shares which excludes the treasury shares.

The EPRA NTA is defined by the European Public Real Estate 

Association (EPRA) as a measure to highlight the value of a 

company’s net tangible assets assuming entities buy and sell 

assets,  thereby  crystallizing  certain  levels  of  unavoidable 

deferred  taxes.  Aroundtown’s  EPRA  NTA  calculation  begins 

by  adding  to  the  Equity  attributable  to  the  owners  of  the 

The EPRA NAV was discontinued by EPRA starting from FY

portfolio,  development  rights  &  invest  portfolio,  GCP’s

portfolio cities classified as “Others” and significant minority 

EPRA  NAV  thereafter.  The  main  difference  between  the 

share in deferred tax liabilities, as well as excluding deferred 

former EPRA NAV and the EPRA NRV is the addition of real 

tax assets on certain financial instruments in line with EPRA 

estate transfer taxes in the EPRA NRV.

value  measurement  of  derivative  financial  instruments  which 

includes  the  derivative  financial  instruments  related  to 

interest hedging and excludes significant minority share in 

derivative  financial  instruments.  Furthermore,  Aroundtown 

deducts the Goodwill in relation to TLG, Goodwill in relation 

to  GCP  and  Intangibles  as  per  the  IFRS  balance  sheet  which 

excludes significant minority share in intangibles. The EPRA 

NTA was reclassified in Dec 2022 to exclude RETT in order 

to  align  better  with  market  standards.  The  EPRA  NTA  per 

share is calculated by dividing the EPRA NTA by the Number 

of shares which excludes the treasury shares. The EPRA NTA 

with  RETT  adds  gross  purchasers’  cost  of  properties  which

EPRA NET DISPOSAL VALUE (EPRA NDV)

The  EPRA  NDV  is  defined  by  the  European  Public  Real

the  shareholders’  value  under  a  disposal  scenario,  where 

deferred  taxes,  financial  instruments  and  certain  other 

adjustments are calculated to the full extent of their liability, 

net  of  any  resulting  tax.  Aroundtown  calculates  its  EPRA 

NDV by deducting from the Equity attributable to the owners 

of  the  Company,  the  Goodwill  in  relation  to TLG  and  Goodwill 

in  relation  to  GCP  and  deducting/adding  the  Net  fair value 

of  debt  which  is  the  difference  between  the  market  value

EPRA EARNINGS

The EPRA Earnings is defined by the European Public Real 

Estate Association (EPRA) as the earnings from operational 

activities  and  serves  as  an  indicator  of  a  company’s 

underlying operational profits for the period in context of 

a  European  real  estate  company. Aroundtown  calculates 

its EPRA Earnings by deducting from the Earnings per IFRS

Independent Limited Assurance Report  
on the Non-Financial Report (Independent Auditor)

Independent Limited Assurance Report

We were engaged by the Board of Directors (the “Management”) of Aroundtown 
SA (“the Company”) to report on the Company’s statements and indicators (the 
“sustainability disclosures information”) that are disclosed in the Company’s Non-
Financial Report 2023 (the “Report”), for the selected ESG topics and KPIs related to 
the year 2023, as listed in Appendix I:

Management is responsible for preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying and 
ensuring that the Company complies with laws and regulations applicable to its activities.

Management is also responsible for ensuring that staff involved with the preparation 
and presentation of the sustainability disclosures information as reported in the 
Report are properly trained, information systems are properly updated and that any 
changes in reporting encompass all significant business units. 

 ● Energy and Carbon Emissions
 ● Environmental Compliance
 ● Diversity and Equality
 ● Employment and Skills 

in the form of an independent limited assurance conclusion as to whether the 
sustainability disclosures information is prepared and presented in all material 
respects in accordance with EPRA Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations 
(“EPRA SBPR”) Guidelines dated September 2017, and the EU Regulation 2020/852 
on EU Taxonomy for Sustainable activities (Article 8) (the “Criteria”).

Responsibilities of the Management of the Company

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and presentation 
of  the  sustainability  disclosures  information  as  reported  in  the  Report  in 
accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes designing, implementing 
and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the sustainability 
disclosures information. 

Our Responsibilities 

Our responsibility is to examine the sustainability disclosures information as 
described in the Report and to report thereon in the form of an independent limited 
assurance conclusion based on the evidence obtained. We conducted our engagement 
in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, 
Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Boards as 
adopted for Luxembourg by the Institut des Réviseurs d’Entreprises (hereafter “IRE”). 

That Standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited 
assurance about whether the sustainability disclosures information as reported in 
the Report is properly prepared and presented in all material respects in accordance 
with the Criteria and is free from material misstatement.

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, “Quality 
Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, 
or Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements” (“ISQM 1”), as adopted for 

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report153

Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) and 
accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including the 
design, implementation and operation of a system of quality management of audits or 
reviews of financial statements, or other assurance and related services engagements.  

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the 
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) 
(IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, which is founded on 
fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due 
care, confidentiality, and professional behaviour. 

Summary of work performed

A limited assurance engagement on the sustainability disclosures information as 
described in the Report consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible 
for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical 
and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate, with relation to the 
sustainability disclosures information as described in the Report.

 - Interviews  with  relevant  staff  responsible  for  providing  and  preparing  the 

information  in  the  Report,  inquiries  and  inspection  of  the  related  controls 

implemented and methodologies used;

 - Confirmation  of  alignment  of  the  content  and  structure  of  the  sustainability 

statement with the Criteria. 

The assurance procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in 

nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance 

engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 

engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained 

had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. A limited assurance 

engagement involves performing procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence 

to give assurance over the matters identified for our report. The assurance procedures 

selected depend on our judgment, the suitable criteria including our assessment of 

the risk of material misstatement in the sustainability disclosures information as 

reported in the Report, whether due to fraud or error.

As part of this engagement, we have not performed any procedures by way of 

 - Conducting media search for references to the Company during the reporting period;

audit, review or verification of the sustainability disclosures information nor of the 

 - Obtaining  and  reading  the  Company’s  policies  and  processes  to  address 

underlying records or other sources from which the information was extracted.

related controls implemented;

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report154

Inherent limitations

Our assurance work was limited to examining the relevant documents that were 
made available by Management. Other than as described in the assurance procedures 
above, we were not required to, nor have we, verified the accuracy or completeness of 
the underlying data from which the Report, provided by the client, has been prepared. 

Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure, it is possible that 
errors or irregularities in the information presented in the Report may occur and not 
be detected. Our engagement is not designed to detect all weaknesses in the internal 
controls over the preparation and presentation of the Report, as the engagement 
has not been performed continuously throughout the period and the procedures 
performed were undertaken on a sample basis.

Our assurance work did not include:

 - Procedures to verify the sustainability disclosures information related to another 

period than for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Conclusion

Our conclusion has been formed on the basis of, and is subject to, the matters 
outlined in this report.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our conclusion.

Based on the assurance procedures performed and evidence obtained, as described 
above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
sustainability disclosures information as reported in the Report are not prepared 
and presented in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.

Restriction of Use of Our Report

Our report is solely for the purpose set forth in the above objective and is not to 
be used for any other purpose. Our report is solely for the use of the Management 
and, through the Company’s website, the investors of the Company (“the Investors”). 
The Investors can rely upon the Report at their own risks. We do not owe any duty to 
the Investors, whether in contract or in tort or under statute or otherwise (including 
in negligence) with respect to or in relation to the Report. Investors will not bring 
any actions, proceedings or claims against KPMG Audit S.à r.l. where the action, 
proceeding or claim in any way relates to or concerns the use of or reliance on 

the Report. We cannot be held liable to Investors for any direct nor indirect loss or 
damage suffered or costs incurred by them, arising out of or in connection with the 
use or the Report, however such loss or damage is caused. 

It might not be translated, summarised, disclosed, published or transmitted 
electronically for any other purposes, without our prior consent.

We will agree with you the basis and timing of communications in order to 
communicate any matters raised during our assignment that we believe to be both 
important and relevant.

2.   BASIS OF PREPARATION

2.1  Statement of compliance

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.

Certain consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of 
financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows’ items related to the year 
ended December 31, 2022 have been reclassified to enhance comparability with 2023 
figures and are marked as “reclassified”.

The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Company’s 
Board of Directors on March 27, 2024.

2.2  Basis of measurement

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, 
applying the historical cost convention, except for the measurement of the following:

 » Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;

 » Investment property is measured at fair value;

 » Owner-occupied properties are measured at fair value;

 » Investment in equity-accounted investees – measured using the equity method;

 » Derivative financial assets and liabilities – measured at fair value;

 » Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale – measured at fair value less costs to sell, 

when applicable;

 » Deferred tax assets and liabilities – measured at the amount expected to be paid to 
(recovered from) the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.

2.3  Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU requires from management the exercise of judgment, to make estimates and 
assumptions that influence the application of accounting principles and the related 
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
deemed to be reasonable based on current knowledge available at that time. Actual 
results may differ from such estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reassessed on a regular basis. Revisions 

in accounting estimates are recognized in the period during which the estimate is 

revised, if the estimate affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and 

future periods, if the revision affects the present as well as future periods. 

Judgments

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the 

following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized 

in the consolidated financial statements:

 ● Leases

Property lease classification (the Group as lessor)

The Group has entered into property leases on its investment property portfolio. The 

Group has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the 

arrangements, such as the lease terms not constituting a major part of the economic 

life of the properties and the present value of the minimum lease payments not 

amounting to substantially all of the fair value of the properties, that it retains 

substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of these properties 

and accounts for the contracts as operating leases.

 ● Revenue from contracts with customers

Determination of performance obligations

In relation to the services provided to tenants of investment property as part of the 

lease agreements into which the Group enters as a lessor, the Group has determined 

that the promise is the overall property management service and that the service 

performed each day is distinct and substantially the same. Although the individual 

activities that comprise the performance obligation vary significantly throughout the 

day and from day to day, the nature of the overall promise to provide management 

service is the same from day to day. Therefore, the Group has concluded that the 

services to tenants represent a series of daily services that are individually satisfied 

over time, using a time-elapsed measure of progress, because tenants simultaneously 

receive and consume the benefits provided by the Group. With respect to the sale of 

property, the Group concluded the goods and services transferred in each contract 

constitute a single performance obligation.

Determining the timing of revenue recognition on the sale of property

and the Company’s management to use certain assumptions regarding rates 

of return on the Group’s assets, future rent, occupancy rates, contract renewal

terms, the probability of leasing vacant areas, asset operating expenses, the

investment in associates may be impaired, the recoverable amount associated 

with this investment (being the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and 

value in use, that is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be 

derived from the investment) would be compared to its carrying amounts to 

determine if a write down to fair value is necessary.

 »

Impairment of non-financial assets (property, equipment and intangible assets) - 

When there is an indication that an asset may be impaired or when annual 

impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s 

recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 

or Cash Generating Unit (CGU)’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in 

use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the 

asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from 

other assets or groups of assets. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 

counsels. These estimates are based on the legal counsels’ best professional 

judgment, taking into account the stage of proceedings and historical legal 

precedents in respect of the different issues. Since the outcome of the claims 

will be determined in court, the results could differ from these estimates.

 » Property leases - estimating the incremental borrowing rate - The Group cannot 

readily determine the interest rate implicit in leases where it is the lessee, 

therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. 

The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over 

a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset 

of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. 

The IBR therefore reflects what the Group ‘would have to pay’, which requires 

estimation when no observable rates are available.

3.  MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

3.1  Changes in accounting policies and disclosures

In the current year, the Group has applied a number of new and amended IFRS 
Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) 
and adopted by the EU that are mandatorily effective in the EU for an accounting period 
that begins on or after January 1, 2023. Their adoption has not had any material impact 
on the disclosures or on the amounts reports in these financial statements.

 ● IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (including the June 2020 Amendments to IFRS 17)

IFRS 17 establishes the principals for the recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of insurance contacts and supersedes IFRS 4 Insurance Contacts. 

IFRS 17 outlines a general model, which is modified for insurance contracts with direct 
participation features, described as the variable fee approach. The general model is 
simplified if certain criteria are met by measuring the liability for remaining coverage 
using the premium allocation approach. The general model uses current assumptions 
to estimate the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows and it explicitly 
measures the cost of that uncertainty. It takes into account market interest rates and 
the impact of policyholders’ options and guarantees. 

The IASB has also developed guidance and examples to explain and demonstrate the 

application of the ‘four-step materiality process’ described in IFRS Practice Statement 2.

 ● Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: 

Definition of Accounting Estimates 

The amendments replace the definition of a change in accounting estimates with a 

definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are 

“monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. 

The definition of a change in accounting estimates was deleted. However, the IASB 

retained the concept of changes in accounting estimates in the Standard with the 

following clarifications: 

 » A  change  in  accounting  estimate  that  results  from  new  information  or  new 

developments is not the correction of an error

 » The effects of a change in an input or a measurement technique used to develop 

an accounting estimate are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result 

 ● Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 

from the correction of prior period errors

2: Disclosure of Accounting policies

The amendments change the requirements in IAS 1 with regard to disclosure of 
accounting policies. The amendments replace all instances of the term ‘significant 
accounting policies’ with ‘material accounting policy information’. Accounting policy 
information is material if, when considered together with other information included 
in an entity’s financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions 
that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of 
those financial statements. 

The supporting paragraphs in IAS 1 are also amended to clarify that accounting policy 
information that relates to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions is 
immaterial and need not be disclosed. Accounting policy information may be material 
because of the nature of the related transactions, other events or conditions, even if 
the amounts are immaterial. However, not all accounting policy information relating to 
material transactions, other events or conditions is itself material. 

The IASB added two examples (Examples 4-5) to the Guidance on implementing IAS 

8, which accompanies the Standard. The IASB has deleted one example (Example 3) 

as it could cause confusion in light of the amendments.

 ● Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities 

arising from a Single Transaction

The amendments introduce a further exception from the initial recognition exemption. 

Under the amendments, an entity does not apply the initial recognition exemption 

for transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

Depending on the applicable tax law, equal taxable and deductible temporary 

differences may arise on initial recognition of an asset and liability in a transaction 

that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit. 

For example, this may arise upon recognition of a lease liability and the corresponding 

right-of-use asset applying IFRS 16 at the commencement date of a lease.

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Consolidated Financial Statements172

Following the amendments to IAS 12, an entity is required to recognize the related

deferred tax asset and liability, with the recognition of any deferred tax asset being 

subject to the recoverability criteria in IAS 12. 

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the 

Company and its subsidiaries as at December 31, 2023. Control is achieved when 

The IASB also adds an illustrative example to IAS 12 that explains how the amendments 

the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 

are applied. 

The amendments apply to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the 

investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:

 » Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give the current ability to direct the 

comparative period an entity recognizes:

 » A deferred tax asset (to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 

available  against  which  the  deductible  temporary  difference  can  be  utilized) 

 » Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee

 » The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns

and a deferred tax liability for all deductible and taxable temporary differences 

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To

-  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities

-  Decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities and the corresponding

appropriate) at that date.

support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or 

similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances 

in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

 » The contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders of the investee

 » Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

 » The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances 

indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.

are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized 

directly in equity attributed to owners of the Company.

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, profit or loss on disposal is calculated 

as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration 

received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying 

amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any

related cumulative gain or loss has been recognized in other comprehensive income 

and accumulated in equity, the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive 

income and accumulated in equity are accounted for as if the Company had directly 

disposed of the relevant assets (i.e., reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly 

to retained earnings as specified by applicable IFRS). The fair value of any investment 

retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the 

3.4  Business combinations and goodwill

The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities 

and assets include an input and a substantive process that, together, significantly 

contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive 

if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include 

an organized workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform 

that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs 

and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, 

or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of 

an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is 

measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interests 

in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure 

non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle 

their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation,

goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional 

information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from 

the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the identifiable assets acquired and 

liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the 

over the aggregate consideration transferred, the gain (defined as a “bargain purchase”) 

is immediately recognized in profit or loss.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the 

reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional 

amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional 

amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities 

are recognized, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances 

that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts

acquiree.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are 

recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:

 » Deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit 

arrangements are recognized and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes 

and IAS 19 Employee Benefits, respectively;

 » Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with 

IFRS 5 Non- current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured 

in accordance with that standard.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated 

to each of the Group’s CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the 

synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the 

acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill 

is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill 

is monitored for internal management purposes and not be larger than an operating 

segment as defined by IFRS 8.

At the Group, each real estate property generally meets the requirements for 

classification as a CGU. As part of internal management, the real estate properties are 

grouped under managed portfolio clusters (TLG and GCP which is a public company, 

and the rest). These portfolio clusters are the lowest level within the Group at which 

goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes hence the impairment test 

is performed at property portfolio level of the acquiree. Other cash-generating assets 

that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and form

gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based 

on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU or group 

of CGUs. A single real estate asset that forms part of the CGU under a managed portfolio 

cluster that is monitored together for internal management purposes does not constitute 

an operation within this group of CGUs. As such, disposals of single properties do not 

result in a derecognition of goodwill.

3.5  Investments in associates and equity-accounted investees

The requirements of IAS 36 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to 

recognize any impairment loss with respect to the Group’s investment in an associate. 

In the event of impairment indicators, the entire carrying amount of the investment 

(including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of 

Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and 

fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount; any impairment loss recognized 

forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment

to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not 

control or joint control over those policies. A jointly controlled entity is an entity in 

which two or more parties have interest.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates and equity-accounted investees are 

incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of 

accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is 

accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 

Operations. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized 

When an entity in the Group transacts with its associate, profits and losses resulting 

from the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Group’s consolidated 

financial statements, however only to the extent of interests in the associate that are 

not related to the Group.

revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term is the non-

cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant 

has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the Group is 

reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.

Revenue from services to tenants

Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested.

Finance expenses comprise interest expense on bank loans, third party borrowings 

and bonds.

invoiced. The Group has determined that these services constitute distinct non-lease 

components (transferred separately from the right to use the underlying asset) and 

are within the scope of IFRS 15. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract 

to the separate lease and revenue (non-lease) components on a relative stand-alone 

selling price basis. 

In respect of the revenue component, these services represent a series of daily services 

that are individually satisfied over time because the tenants simultaneously receive and 

consume the benefits provided by the Group. The Group applies the time elapsed method 

to measure progress.

3.8  Current tax and property taxes

Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be 

recovered from or paid to taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute 

the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in 

the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in other comprehensive income 

or equity is recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity and not in the

Other revenue

Other revenue includes mainly management fee, consulting fees as well as income 

from loans in connection with real estate transactions. This income is included in 

revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

3.9  Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between 

the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 

purposes at the reporting date. 

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:

 ● When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of 
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the 

time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. 

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Consolidated Financial Statements177

 ● In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements, when the timing of the 

reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 

temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, the 

carryforward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are 

recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 

which the deductible temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax credits 

and unused tax losses can be utilized, except:

 ● When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises 
from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 

combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit 

nor taxable profit or loss.

 ● In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in 
subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred 

tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary 

Deferred tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either 

in OCI or directly in equity.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria 

for separate recognition at that date, are recognized subsequently if there is new 

information about changes in facts and circumstances. The adjustment is either treated 

as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred 

during the measurement period or recognized in profit or loss.

The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if, and only if, it has a 

legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the 

deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 

taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which 

intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the 

assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant 

amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is stated at fair value, which 

reflects market conditions at the reporting date. Gains or losses arising from changes 

in the fair values of investment property are included in profit or loss in the period in 

which they arise, including the corresponding tax effect. 

Transfers are made to (or from) investment property only when there is evidence of a 

change in use (such as commencement of development or inception of an operating

to the directly attributable costs incurred on the property sold and an allocation of any 

other related costs based on the relative size of the property sold.

For presenting of the disposal results of a trading property, the Group identifies whether 

the sale of a trading property forms part of its ordinary activities or not. In case it does, 

recognition of the revenue and expense will be as described above. Otherwise, the 

resulting gain or loss will be presented in net, outside of the Group’s revenue, under 

the line item property revaluation, capital gains and other income in the consolidated 

statement of profit or loss.

3.15  Non-current assets held for sale

The Group classifies non-current assets (principally investment property) and disposal 

groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through 

a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal 

groups classified as held for sale (except for investment property measured at fair 

value) are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to 

sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an 

asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs and income tax expense.

The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is 

highly probable, and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in 

its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is 

unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell 

will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and 

the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of the classification. 

Investment property held for sale continues to be measured at fair value. Assets and 

liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the consolidated 

statement of financial position.

When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, 

all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when 

the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a 

non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.

A financial instrument is any contract that gives right to a financial asset of one entity 

and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

(a)  Financial assets

(1)  Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at 

amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through 

profit or loss.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial 

asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for 

managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a 

significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical 

expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the 

case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. 

Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which 

the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price 

determined under IFRS 15. See note 3.6.

In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or fair 

value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of 

principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment 

is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.

The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages 

its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines 

whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the 

financial assets, or both.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time 

frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular way 

trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to 

purchase or sell the asset.

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Consolidated Financial Statements181

(2)  Subsequent measurement

For the purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in 

four categories:

1.  Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)

For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, interest income, foreign exchange 

revaluation and impairment losses or reversals are recognized in consolidated 

statement of profit or loss and computed in the same manner as for financial assets 

measured at amortized cost. The remaining fair value changes are recognized in 

OCI. Upon de-recognition, the cumulative fair value change recognized in OCI is

Financial assets at fair value through OCI (equity instruments)

Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity

they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 and are not held for trading. The 

classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.

Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss.

flows that would otherwise be required or a reclassification of a financial asset out

(4)  Impairment of financial assets

The Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit loss for all financial assets 

not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference 

between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all 

the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of

through profit or loss.

(3)  De-recognition

Financial asset (or, where applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of 

similar financial assets) is primarily de-recognized (i.e., removed from the Group’s 

consolidated statement of financial position) when:

 ● The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or

 ● The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has 
assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material 

delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the 

Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) 

the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and 

rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the asset.

ECLs are recognized in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not 

been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided 

for credit losses that result from defaults events that are possible within the next 

12 months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has 

been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance 

is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, 

irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL). The Group presumes 

that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial 

recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the 

Group has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.

Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible 

default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month 

ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default 

events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred 

when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has 

reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging 

default criterion is more appropriate. A financial asset is written off when there is 

no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

(b)  Financial liabilities

(1) Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities at amortized cost

This is the category most relevant to the Group. After initial recognition, interest-

bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost 

using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the 

liabilities are de-recognized as well as through the EIR amortization process.

Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on 

acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair 

value through profit or loss or at amortized cost.

(3) De-recognition

All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans 

and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs and are 

subsequently expensed via EIR.

(2) Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as 

described below:

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities 

held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at 

fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the 

purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative 

financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging 

instruments in hedge relationships as defined by IFRS 9. Separated embedded 

derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as 

effective hedging instruments.

A financial liability is de-recognized when the obligation under the liability is 

discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced 

by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of 

an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification 

is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a 

new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in 

the consolidated statement of profit or loss. 

(c) 

Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) Reform

IBOR reform Phase 2 requires, as a practical expedient, for changes to the basis for 

determining contractual cash flows that are necessary as a direct consequence of IBOR 

reform to be treated as a change to a floating rate of interest, provided the transition 

from IBOR to a risk-free rate (RFR) takes place on a basis that is ‘economically equivalent’. 

To qualify as ‘economically equivalent’, the terms of the financial instrument must be the 

same before and after transition except for the changes required by IBOR reform. For 

changes that are not required by IBOR reform, the Group applies judgement to determine 

whether they result in the financial instrument being derecognized. Therefore, as financial 

instruments transition from IBOR to RFRs, the Group applied judgement to assess 

whether the transition had taken place on an economically equivalent basis. In making 

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Consolidated Financial Statements184

this assessment, the Group considered the extent of any changes to the contractual cash

subsequent years.

(d)  Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in 

the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal 

right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, 

or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

3.17  Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the 

issue of ordinary shares are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

3.18  Mandatory convertible notes

Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the 

convertible bonds, based on the allocation of the proceeds to the liability and equity 

components when the instruments are initially recognized.

On conversion, the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is 

recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

3.20  Treasury shares

When own shares are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid including 

direct acquisition costs is recognized as a deduction from equity. Repurchased own 

shares are classified as treasury shares, presented in the treasury share reserve and 

are not revaluated after the acquisition. When treasury shares are subsequently sold or 

delivered, the amount received is recognized as an increase in equity and the resulting 

Mandatory convertible notes are classified as equity, and coupon related to the 

surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in the share premium.

Interest are presented as liability and must be paid by the Company upon conversion 

event and should not compound interest. Issuance costs incurred are deducted from 

the initial carrying amount of the notes.

3.19  Convertible bonds

Perpetual notes have no maturity date and may only be redeemed by the Group, at 

its sole discretion, on certain dates. The perpetual notes are recognized as equity 

attributable to its holders, which forms part of the total equity of the Group. The 

Company may, at its sole discretion, elect to defer the payment of interest on the notes 

(referred to as Arrears of Interest). Arrears of Interest must be paid by the Company upon 

the occurrence of certain events, including but not limited to, dividends, distributions or 

other payments made to instruments such as the Company’s ordinary shares, which rank 

junior to the perpetual notes. Upon occurrence of such an event, any Arrears of Interest

3.22  Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

Hedges that meet all the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for and 

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

further described below:

The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, 

Cash flow hedges

interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks, 

interest rate risks and fair value risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially 

recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and 

are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets 

when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in 

OCI and accumulated in the hedge reserves, while any ineffective portion is recognized 

immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The cash flow hedge reserve 

is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and 

the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item.

The forward element is recognized in OCI and accumulated in a separate component

3.28  Share-based payment transactions 

The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to 

employees is generally recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in

The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the 

lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Initially, the right-

of-use assets are measured at cost and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease 

liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 

recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the 

commencement date less any lease incentives received.

3.31  Standards issued but not yet effective

As part of the amendments, the IASB amended an Illustrative Example in IFRS 16 

and added a new example to illustrate the subsequent measurement of a right-of-

use asset and lease liability in a sale and leaseback transaction with variable lease 

payments that do not depend on an index or rate. The illustrative examples also clarify 

that the liability that arises from a sale and leaseback transaction that qualifies as a 

sale applying IFRS 15 is a lease liability.

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 

January 1, 2024. Earlier application is permitted. If a seller-lessee applies the 

amendments for an earlier period, it is required to disclose that fact.

A seller-lessee applies the amendments retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 

to sale and leaseback transactions entered into after the date of initial application, 

which is defined as the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity 

first applied IFRS 16.

The amendments to IAS 1 issued in August 2022 specify that only covenants that an 

entity is required to comply with on or before the end of the reporting period affect 

the entity’s right to defer settlement of a liability for at least twelve months after the 

reporting date (and therefore must be considered in assessing the classification of 

the liability as current or non-current). Such covenants affect whether the right exists 

at the end of the reporting period, even if compliance with the covenant is assessed 

only after the reporting date (e.g. a covenant based on the entity’s financial position 

at the reporting date that is assessed for compliance only after the reporting date).

The IASB also specifies that the right to defer settlement of a liability for at least 

twelve months after the reporting date is not affected if an entity only has to comply 

with a covenant after the reporting period. However, if the entity’s right to defer 

settlement of a liability is subject to the entity complying with covenants within 

twelve months after the reporting period, an entity discloses information that enables 

users of financial statements to understand the risk of the liabilities becoming 

repayable within twelve months after the reporting period. This would include 

information about the covenants (including the nature of the covenants and when 

the entity is required to comply with them), the carrying amount of related liabilities 

and facts and circumstances, if any, that indicate that the entity may have difficulties 

complying with the covenants.

The amendments are applied retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning 

on or after January 1, 2024. Earlier application of the amendments is permitted.

The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has 

been issued but is not yet effective.

Level 1: the fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as debt and 

equity securities) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.

 ● The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, 
principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Interest rate 

Level 2: the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market 

(for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques 

which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on 

entity-specific estimates. If all significant input required to fair value of financial 

instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

Level 3: if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, 

the instrument is included in level 3.

and foreign exchange swap and forward contracts are valued using valuation 

techniques, which employ the use of market observable inputs. The most frequently 

applied valuation technique includes forward pricing and swap models using 

present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the 

credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield 

curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective 

currencies, interest rate curves and forward rate curves.

The Group’s policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy

5.1  Reportable segments

When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the 

consolidated statement of financial position cannot be measured based on quoted prices

Information reported to the Group’s CODM for the purposes of resource allocation and

assessment of segment performance is based on Aroundtown’s commercial portfolio 

in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of input such as liquidity 

and GCP’s portfolio, and contains the segments’ revenue, net operating income and

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: 

 ● The fair values of the quoted bonds are based on price quotations at the reporting 
date. The fair value of unquoted bonds is measured using the discounted cash flow 

method with observable inputs.

The portfolio includes mainly office and hotel properties. The Group’s assets are well-

diversified and well-located across top tier cities in Europe with a focus on Germany 

and the Netherlands.

 ● There is an active market for the Company’s listed equity investments and quoted 

GCP is a specialist in residential real estate, investing in value-add opportunities

 ● For the fair value measurement of investments in unlisted funds, the net asset value 
is used as a valuation input and an adjustment is applied for lack of marketability 

in densely populated areas predominantly in Germany and London. GCP’s portfolio, 

excluding assets held for sale and properties under development, as of December 

31, 2023, consists of 63 thousand units (2022: 64 thousand units), located in densely

The Company is subject to taxation under the laws of Luxembourg. The corporation 

tax rate for Luxembourg companies is 24.94% (2022: 24.94%).

The German subsidiaries containing real estate property are subject to taxation under 

the laws of Germany. Income taxes are calculated using a federal corporate tax of 15.0% 

for December 31, 2023 (2022: 15.0%), plus an annual solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on 

the amount of federal corporate taxes payable (aggregated tax rate: 15.825%). When

trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). German property taxation includes taxes on the holding of 

real estate property based on the location and size of the property.

The Cypriot subsidiaries are subject to taxation under the laws of Cyprus. The 

corporation tax rate for Cypriot companies is 12.5% (2022: 12.5%). Under certain 

Pillar Two legislation was enacted in several jurisdictions in which the Group operates. 

Since the Pillar Two legislation was not effective at the reporting date, the Group has 

no related current tax exposure. The Group applies the exception to recognising and

contribution at the rate of 30.0% (2022: 30.0%). In such cases this interest will be 

exempt from corporation tax. In certain cases, dividends received from abroad may 

be subject to special defense contribution at the rate of 17.0% (2022: 17.0%). In such 

case, this dividend income will be exempt from Cyprus income (corporation) tax. Under 

certain conditions, dividend income earned from Cyprus tax resident companies is 

exempt from special defense contribution and Cyprus income (corporation) tax.

The Dutch subsidiaries are subject to taxation under the laws of the Netherlands. The 

Dutch corporation tax rate for the financial year 2023 is 25.8% (reduced rate of 15% 

applies to taxable income up to €395 thousand) (2022: 25.8% and 15%, respectively). 

The UK subsidiaries containing real estate property, are subject to taxation under the 

laws of the United Kingdom. Income taxes are calculated using a federal corporate tax 

(also for capital gains) of 25.0% (reduced rate of 19% applies to taxable income up to 

GBP 250 thousand) for December 31, 2023 (2022: 19.0%). Where there are UK group 

subsidiaries this threshold is divided by the number of UK group entities.

Subsidiaries in other jurisdictions are subject to corporate tax rate of up to 27.9% 

(2022: 27.9%).

Under the legislation, the group is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between 

their Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) effective tax rate per jurisdiction and a 15% 

minimum rate.

The Group is in the process of assessing its exposure to the Pillar Two legislation. 

Due to the complexities in applying the legislation and calculating GloBE income, 

the quantitative impact of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation is not yet 

reasonably estimable. The Group is currently engaged with tax specialists to assist them 

with applying the legislation.

The fair value of the investment property is determined using the following valuation 

methods:

 ● Discounted cash flow method

Under the DCF method, fair value is estimated using assumptions regarding the benefits 

and liabilities of ownership over the asset’s life including an exit or terminal value. This 

method involves the projection of a series of cash flows on a real property interest. To 

this projected cash flow series, an appropriate, market derived discount rate is applied 

to establish the present value of the income stream associated with the asset. The exit 

yield is normally separately determined and differs from the discount rate.

The duration of the cash flows and the specific timing of inflows and outflows are 

determined by events such as rent reviews, lease renewal and related re-letting, 

redevelopment, and refurbishment. The appropriate durations are typically driven by 

market behavior that is a characteristic of the class of real property.

The additional construction costs are also part of the total development costs. The 

recoverable expenses, collection losses on future rents, lease incentives, maintenance 

following additional costs are common for constructions: planning, construction, 

cost, agent and commission costs and other operating and management expenses. The 

official review and approval costs as well as financing required immediately for

 ● Comparable approach

costs as well as other project costs including financing costs and developer’s profit are 

subtracted from the calculated gross sale value of the completed development. The 

Under the market comparable approach, a property’s fair value is estimated based on 

difference of the gross sale value and the development costs results in the remainder 

comparable transactions. The market comparable approach is based upon the principle 

(residuum). In order to acquire the residual value, financing and additional purchasing 

of substitution under which a potential buyer will not pay more for the property than 

costs for the property are deducted from this remainder. The residual value represents

tenants’ facilities, provision and layout of accommodation, as well as market sentiment 

and how the individual units would be received by the market. The most recent sales 

data for individual units within the subject property and comparable evidence within the 

immediate area will be taken into account and adjusted by premium according to the 

specifics of the property and its units. The achieved market sales price per square meter 

will be multiplied by the area of the property to achieve the property specific market value.

 ● Residual value approach

The residual value assesses the various factors associated with a conversion or a new 

development of a property. The goal of this method is to calculate an objective value 

for the site, which is either undeveloped or sub-optimally utilized. The residual value 

is determined by first calculating the net capital value of the property after completion 

of the planned development project. This figure is derived by subtracting the non-

recoverable operating costs (e.g., maintenance and management costs) from the 

potential gross sale value. In order to determine the net capital value, the purchaser’s 

costs have to be deducted. The costs for the assumed development are subtracted 

from the net capital value, resulting in the remainder (residuum). These costs include 

building fees as well as other required fees, which are necessary for the construction 

of a building, depending on its type of use.

business combination transactions is attributable mainly to deferred tax liabilities initially 

consolidated therein; while most of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities were 

initially recognized at their fair value, the deferred tax liabilities were calculated pursuant 

to IAS 12 principles and reflected the nominal tax values of the variance between the real 

estate portfolios’ carrying amount for tax purposes and their fair value. 

The Group considers the operational real estate portfolios under TLG and GCP as each 

one being a single CGU for internal management purposes to which the full amount of 

goodwill is allocated. For GCP, there are some additional assets allocated to the CGU 

that are expected to benefit from the business combination. The Company assesses 

on an annual basis the impairment of each of the goodwill items by comparing the 

carrying amount of the CGU (together with the attributed goodwill and adjusted for the 

amount of the deferred tax liability based on temporary differences initially recognized 

in the business combination but not reversed at the date of the impairment test) to their 

recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is calculated as the higher of (a) 

fair value less costs of disposal and (b) value in use.

During the year 2022, goodwill on GCP and TLG was impaired in a total amount of €404.3 

million, and as of December 31, 2022 amounted to €600.1 million and €680.7 million, 

respectively.

For testing of the goodwill on GCP, the examination had to include all the business 

units and activities within the group of GCP to which the goodwill relates (i.e., the CGU 

assets, being the investment property, goodwill, specific additional financial assets and 

deferred tax liabilities recognized during the business combination but not yet reversed) 

and amounted to €8,921.8 million as at December 31, 2023 (2022: €10,221.0 million). 

The carrying amount was compared to the recoverable amount being the fair value 

of the CGU less assumed costs of disposal that amounted to €8,861.5 million (2022: 

recoverable amount of €9,958.1 million, being the fair value less costs of disposal) and 

therefore concluded an impairment of €60.3 million on the goodwill on GCP for 2023 

(2022: €262.9 million) to a residual amount of €539.8 million. The Company assumed

in use, mainly due to the increased cost of capital that would affect the discounted cash 

flows model on which the value in use is based.

For testing of the goodwill on TLG, the carrying CGU amount as at December 31, 2023, 

amounted to €2,725.2 million (2022: €3,736.1 million) (being the investment property, 

goodwill and deferred tax liabilities recognized during the business combination but 

not yet reversed). The carrying amount was compared to the recoverable amount being 

the fair value of the CGU less assumed costs of disposal that amounted to €2,648.5 

million (2022: recoverable amount of €3,594.7 million, being the fair value less costs of 

disposal) and therefore concluded with an impairment of €76.7 million on the goodwill 

on TLG for 2023 (2022: €141.4 million) to a residual amount of €604.0 million. The

1.  tenancy deposits mainly include several months net rent from the tenants which is paid at the beginning of 
the lease. The deposits are considered a security payment by the tenant. The Group can primarily use these 
funds, when the tenant has unpaid debts or causes damages to the property. Experience shows that the 
majority of the leases are long term and therefore the deposits are presented as long term assets

2.  consists of mainly the revenue straight-lining effect arising from the rent-free granted to tenants

3.  consists of mainly non-current investments in loans connected with future real-estate transactions (with maturi-
ties primarily by 2027 and an annual interest rate of up to 10% p.a.), long-term deposits and the non-current por-
tion of the loans provided by the Group as a seller (vendor loans). The vendor loans have maturities between 2024 
and 2026, carrying weighted average interest rates of ca. 5% p.a. and are secured against the properties sold at an 
initial LTV in the range of 40%-70% at the time of disposal. An amount of €161.0 million (2022: €199.9 million) 
is accounted for at fair value through profit or loss and includes mainly investment in various real estate funds

B.V.), and 5-year Mid-Swap rate plus a margin of 3.637% p.a. (6.33% p.a.) (for the 

notes issued by GCP).

During 2023, similar decision was taken on the $641.5 million perpetual notes 

with first call date in July 2023 issued by AT Securities B.V. (a fully owned 

subsidiary of the Company) and the €350 million perpetual notes with first call 

date in October 2023 issued by GCP. Consequently, to the decisions not to use the 

option to redeem, the coupons on these perpetual notes starting from July 2023 

and October 2023 were set to be 5-year Mid-Swap rate plus a margin of 3.546% 

p.a. (7.75% p.a.), and 5-year Mid-Swap rate plus a margin of 2.432% p.a. (5.9% p.a.).

In December 2023, the Company announced its Board of Directors’ decision not 

to exercise its option to voluntarily redeem its €400 million perpetual notes on 

their first call date being January 2024. The annual coupon rate starting from 

January 2024 was amended to 5-year Mid-Swap rate plus a margin of 2.0% p.a. 

(4.54% p.a.).

The Company and GCP have the option to call the uncalled perpetuals at every 

future coupon payment date, and the uncalled perpetuals have been and will 

continue being accounted for as equity in the consolidated statement of financial

on the relevant series of bonds) of the sum of (without duplication): (i) the Total 
Assets (less Cash and Cash Equivalents) as at the Last Reporting Date; and (ii) 
the value of all assets acquired or contracted for acquisition by the Group as 
determined at the relevant time in accordance with IFRS and the accounting 
principles applied by the Company in the latest Financial Statements as certified 
by the auditors of the Company since the Last Reporting Date (or, as the case 
may be, the purchase price of any Real Estate Property acquired or contracted for 
acquisition by the Group since the Last Reporting Date); and (iii) the proceeds of 
any Indebtedness incurred since the Last Reporting Date (but only to the extent 
that such proceeds were not used to acquire Real Estate Property or to reduce 
Indebtedness); and  

(b) 

(i) the Consolidated Secured Indebtedness (excluding the GCP Series E Bonds, as 
the case may be, and in each case less Cash and Cash Equivalents) as at the Last 
Reporting Date; and (ii) the Net Secured Indebtedness (excluding the GCP Series 
E Bonds, as the case may be, and in each case less Cash and Cash Equivalents) 
incurred since the Last Reporting Date shall not exceed 45 per cent. of the sum

at the Last Reporting Date; (ii) the value of all assets acquired or contracted for 
acquisition by the Group as determined at the relevant time in accordance with

acquired or contracted for acquisition by the Group since the Last Reporting Date); 
and (iii) the proceeds of any Indebtedness incurred since the Last Reporting Date 
(but only to the extent that such proceeds were not used to acquire Real Estate 
Property or to reduce Indebtedness).

In  most  of  the  Company’s  outstanding  series  of  bonds  (excluding  Series  36),  the 
Company  undertakes  that  the  sum  of:  (i)  the  Unencumbered Assets  (less  Cash  and 
Cash Equivalents) as at the Last Reporting Date; and (ii) the Net Unencumbered Assets 
(less Cash and Cash Equivalents) newly recorded since the Last Reporting Date will at 
no time be less than 125 per cent. of the sum of: (i) the Unsecured Indebtedness (less 
Cash  and  Cash  Equivalents)  at  the  Last  Reporting  Date;  and  (ii)  the  Net  Unsecured 
Indebtedness (less Cash and Cash Equivalents) incurred since the Last Reporting Date.

The Company undertakes that, on each Reporting Date, the Interest Coverage Ratio will 
be at least 1.8 (excluding one series of standalone bonds, for which the Consolidated 
Coverage Ratio will be at least 2.0).

Save for two of the Company’s series of bonds, which contains similar provisions, the 
Company’s  outstanding  series  of  bonds  contain  a  customary  negative  pledge  clause 
that  prohibits  the  Company,  so  long  as  any  of  the  Senior  Notes  remain  outstanding, 
from  creating  or  having  outstanding  any  Security  Interest  (other  than  a  Permitted 
Security  Interest)  upon  any  of  its  present  or  future  business,  undertaking,  assets  or 
revenues (including any uncalled capital) to secure any Capital Markets Indebtedness, 
unless the Company promptly takes any and all action necessary to ensure that:

(i) 

(ii) 

all amounts payable by it under the Senior Notes and the Trust Deed are secured 
by the Security Interest equally and rateably with the Capital Markets Indebtedness 
to the satisfaction of the Trustee; or

such other Security Interest or other arrangement is provided either (i) as the Trustee 
in its absolute discretion deems not materially less beneficial to the interests of 
the Senior Noteholders or (ii) as is approved by an Extraordinary Resolution of the 
Senior Noteholders.

The exposure of the Company to interest rate risk in relation to financial instruments is 
reported in note 25.3.1.1 to the financial statements. There have been no breaches in 
covenants during the year and up to the date of approval of these consolidated financial 

statements.

25.3  Risks management objectives and polices

The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and 

As at December 31, 2023, after considering the effect of the hedging, the 

borrowings,  convertible,  straight  bonds  and  schuldscheins,  trade  and  other  payable, 

interest profile of the Group’s interest-bearing debt was as follows:

tax payable and non-current liabilities. The Group’s principal financial assets include 

trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalent and other non-current assets. 

The  Group  also  holds  investments  in  debt  and  equity  instruments  and  enters  into 

derivative transactions.

The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board of Directors 

has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk 

management framework. The Board of Directors is supported by a risk committee that 

advises  on  financial  risks  and  the  appropriate  financial  risk  governance  framework

analyze the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and 

monitor  risks  and  adherence  to  limits.  Risk  management  policies  and  systems  are 

reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and in the Group’s activities.

25.3.1  Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument 

will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types 

of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk. 

25.3.1.1  Interest rate risk

The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates 

primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest 

rates (mainly to EURIBOR rates). The Group manages its interest rate risk 

by  hedging  long-term  debt  with  floating  rate  using  swap,  collar  and  cap 

contracts.

The  following  table  demonstrates  the  sensitivity  to  a  reasonably  possible 

change in interest rates on that portion of long-term debt affected, after the 

impact of hedging. With all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit 

before tax and pre-tax equity are affected through the impact on floating 

rate long-term debt, as follows:

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Consolidated Financial Statements25.3.1.2. Foreign currency risk

Trade and other receivables

225

The  Group’s  exposure  to  the  risk  of  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates 
relates primarily to the Group’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and 
to several straight bonds issued in a foreign currency. 

The Company used cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value 
and cash flow risk derived from the changes in exchange rates and interest 
rates as explained in note 25.4.2.1 and 25.4.2.2.

Due to the hedging above there is no material residual foreign currency risk.

In addition, the Company used forward contracts to hedge the currency risk 
of its net investment in foreign operation which is denominated in GBP as 
explained in note 25.4.2.3

25.3.1.3. Equity price risk

The Group’s listed and non-listed equity investments are susceptible to market 
price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment 
securities.  The  Group  manages  the  equity  risk  through  diversification  and 
by  placing  limits  on  individual  and  total  equity  instruments.  Reports  on 
the equity portfolio are submitted to the Group’s senior management on a 
regular basis.

25.3.2. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under 
a  financial  instrument  or  customer  contract,  leading  to  a  financial  loss.  The 
Group  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  from  its  operating  activities  (primarily  trade 
and other receivables, loans as a seller and loans connected with future real-
estate transactions) and from its financing activities, including cash and cash 
equivalents  held  in  banks,  derivatives  and  other  financial  instruments.  The 
Group’s  maximum  credit  risk  is  represented  by  the  financial  assets’  carrying 
amount (see note 25.1).

Customer  credit  risk  is  managed  by  the  property  managers  subject  to  the 

Group’s established policy and control procedures relating to customer credit 

risk management. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. 

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision 

to  measure  expected  credit  loss.  The  calculation  reflects  the  probability-

weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable 

information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current 

conditions  and  forecasts  of  future  economic  conditions.  The  assessment  of 

the  correlation  between  historical  observed  default  rates,  forecast  economic 

conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive 

to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group’s 

historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic condition may also 

not be representative of customer’s actual default in the future.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.

The aging of rent receivables at the end of the year that were not impaired 

was as follows:

Not past due and past due 1–30 days

Past due 31–90 days

Past due above 90 days

Management  believes  that  the  unimpaired  amounts  that  are  past  due  by 

more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on the historical payment 

behavior and extensive analysis of customer credit risk, including underlying 

customers’ credit ratings if they are available.

Financial instruments and cash and cash equivalents

Credit line

The  Group  ensures  accessible  additional  liquidity  by  maintaining  active 

revolving  credit  facilities  (“RCF”)  from  various  financial  institutions.  As  at 

December 31, 2023, the Group had approximately €1 billion RCF with maturity 

of more than one year, all undrawn.

The  main  terms  and  conditions  including  covenants,  pledge  and  negative 

pledge of the RCF are similar to those of the bonds’ detailed in note 21.4, with 

relevant adjustments.

Credit  risk  from  balances  with  banks  and  financial  institutions  is  managed 

by  the  Group’s  treasury  department  in  accordance  with  the  Group’s  policy. 

Investments  of  surplus  funds  are  made  only  with  approved  counterparties 

and  within  credit  limits  assigned  to  each  counterparty.  The  limits  are  set 

to  minimize  the  concentration  of  risks  and  therefore  mitigate  financial  loss 

through a counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.

The Group’s investment in equity and debt instruments at fair value through 

profit or loss consists of quoted securities that are graded in the investment 

category.

The Group holds its cash and cash equivalents and its derivative instruments 

with  highly-rated  (mostly  between  A-  to  A+  by  the  leading  global  rating 

agencies)  banks  and  financial  institutions  located  mainly  in  Switzerland, 

Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Concentration risk is mitigated by 

not limiting the exposure to a single counter party. The Company has performed 

an expected credit loss (“ECL”) calculation on the cash and cash equivalents 

accounts  and  presented  the  current  balance  net  of  the  ECL  provision  that 

amounted to €3.3 million as at December 31, 2023 (2022: €3.5 million).

The composition of cash and cash equivalents was as follows:

including  estimated  interest  payments,  the  impact  of  derivatives  and 

can also increase the risk of loss. The Group has procedures with the objective 

excluding the impact of netting agreements as at December 31, 2023, and as 

of minimizing such losses such as maintaining sufficient cash and other highly

25.3.4. Operating risk

Operational risk is the risk that derives from the deficiencies relating to the 

Group’s information technology and control systems as well as the risk of human 

error and natural disasters.  The Group’s systems are evaluated, maintained and 

upgraded continuously.

25.3.5. Other risks

The general economic environment prevailing internationally may affect the 

Group’s  operations  to  a  great  extent.  Economic  conditions  such  as  inflation, 

unemployment,  and  development  of  the  gross  domestic  product  are  directly

Geopolitical situation around Russia-Ukraine war

On February 24, 2022, Russia initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and escalating 

the  Russo-Ukraine  War  (the “War”)  and  hostilities  have  continued  since  then. The 

War has received widespread international condemnation and in reaction to Russian 

hostilities  many  nations  and  organizations,  including  Germany  and  the  European 

Union, have announced sanctions against Russia, Russian companies, and individuals 

in  and  from  Russia.  The  Group  is  not  directly  impacted  by  the  War,  as  neither  its 

portfolio nor its operations have direct exposure to Ukraine or Russia. However, the 

Group is impacted by the indirect consequences of the War. As a result of the War, 

inflationary  pressures  have  increased,  specifically  heating  and  energy  costs,  which 

have an impact on the operating costs of the Group. Such pressures may also have 

an impact on the ability of the group’s tenants to pay rent and/or for the Group to 

recover  expenses  related  to  recoverable  expenses  from  tenants.  Furthermore,  the 

The COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, the high amount of cash injected 

into  the  market  as  a  monetary  response  and  the  geopolitical  situation  around 

Russia and Ukraine, among others, have resulted in a high inflationary environment. 

Inflationary pressure has been particularly strong in energy prices, in particular for 

oil and gas, caused by the War, and material prices.  While in recent periods pressures 

have  eased  to  a  certain  extent,  inflation  remains  above  central  bank  targets. 

Furthermore, risks remain that may result in inflationary pressures increasing once 

more.  This  may  also  result  in  tenant’s  inability  to  bear  the  costs  that  are  passed 

through to them as part of the lease agreements. While in the recent period of high 

inflation no material losses in regard to collection from tenants has been recorded, 

it cannot be ruled out that losses of rent will occur in the future or that the Group 

will be unable to collect operating costs from tenants and that the Group will lose 

considerable rental income. In order to mitigate the risk, the Company is proactively 

informing tenants on their consumption of energy and provides information on how 

to reduce consumption.

volatility in capital markets, which has a negative impact on the cost and availability 

of new financing for the Group on one hand and may put further upward pressure on 

discount rates and cap rates if prolonged, which could consequently have a further 

adverse impact on the fair value of the Group’s assets and share price performance.

The ability of landlords to increase rents under existing tenancy agreements is limited 

under German law, especially in residential properties in Germany where rent increases 

may  be  limited  as  a  result  of  tenant  protection.  In  the  commercial  portfolio,  the 

majority of the leases are indexed or have stepped rent which enables the Company to 

capture inflation faster. However, it may take the Company to capture the full impact 

of inflation and the inflation rate may exceed the Company’s ability to increase rents 

for certain properties. In addition, even if rent increases are contractually agreed, or 

legally permissible, enforcement may not be feasible in certain cases due to solvency 

issues of tenants that cannot afford such rent increases.

An increase in interest rates

In order to battle the increased inflation levels, the European Central Bank has raised 

interest rate levels rapidly and has declared that it would maintain high interest levels 

at least until inflation slows down and it reached the desired level. This has led to a 

significant rise in interest rates in Germany and throughout the Eurozone and led to a 

decrease in real estate valuations and investments, resulting in lower transaction level 

and lower demand for real estate, among other effects. An increase in interest rates 

could adversely impact the Group’s business in a number of ways, including: 

The  discount  and  cap  rates  used  to  calculate  the  value  of  the  Group’s  properties 

recorded on the Company’s balance sheet in accordance with IAS 40 tends to increase 

in  an  environment  of  rising  interest  rates,  which  in  turn  could  result  in  the  Group’s 

properties having a lower fair value. 

Although the Group’s current debt structure primarily involves debt at fixed interest 

rates or, where variable interest rates apply, is predominantly subject to interest rate 

hedging agreements, the increase in interest rates may have a negative impact on the 

Group’s ability to refinance existing debt or incur additional debt on favorable terms. 

expenditure  and/or  other  real  estate  activities  more  expensive,  which  could  reduce 

the Group’s profits. 

When  negotiating  financing  agreements  or  extending  such  agreements,  the  Group 

depends on its ability to agree to terms and conditions that will provide for interest 

payments that will not impair its profit targets, and for amortization schedules that 

do not restrict its ability to pay intended dividends. Further, the Group may be unable 

to  enter  into  hedging  instruments  that  may  become  necessary  if  variable  interest 

rates are agreed upon or may only be able to do so at significant costs. If the current 

environment in which high rates prevail will remain for a prolonged period, the Group’s 

financing costs, including costs for hedging instruments, may increase, which would 

likely reduce the Group’s profits. 

The Group’s equity includes a material amount of perpetual notes. Such notes include 

in  their  terms  a  reset  of  their  respective  interest  rates  every  five years  (reset  date), 

starting from the first call date, based on a specified margin plus a 5-year swap rate 

(reset rate). If a reset date falls in a period of high interest rates it is likely that such 

notes will carry a materially higher interest going forward, thereby reducing the profits 

available  to  shareholders.  Furthermore,  the  Company  generally  aims  to  replace  its 

perpetual notes issues on their first voluntary call date by a new issue. In times of high 

interest  rates,  the  rates  that  the  Company  would  pay  on  a  new  issuance  may  differ 

materially from the reset rate, it may therefore be uneconomical for the Company to 

call the respective notes and issue new notes, as has been the case with its notes with 

the first call date in January, July and October 2023. 

The  willingness  of  purchasers  to  acquire  real  estate  in  an  environment  of  rising 

interest  rates  may  be  negatively  affected,  thereby  restricting  the  Group’s  ability  to 

dispose of its properties on favorable terms when desired. Most purchasers finance 

their acquisitions with lender provided financing through mortgages and comparable 

security (in Germany so-called land charges). Lack of availability of such financing at 

attractive rates therefore reduces demand for properties. 

Financial institutions such as banks may seek to reduce their exposure to the real estate 

Any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, 

sector and also might be subject to increased equity requirements and balance sheet 

net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Climate-related risks

The significant impact of human activity on ecosystems and the climate have become 

introduced a fixed price for carbon dioxide emissions in the transport and real estate 

apparent  in  recent  years,  with  temperatures  rising,  severe  weather  events  such  as 

drought, floods and wildfires occurring more frequently, changes in rainfall patterns 

and mean global sea levels rising, as well as increased pressures on biodiversity, among 

sectors as from January 2021. The price per metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted as 
heating or fuel emissions (CO2 and CO2 levy) was set at an initial price of euro 25.00 
per  metric  ton  of  carbon  dioxide  and  will,  based  on  the  current  regime,  gradually 

others.  Consequently,  climate  risks  have  increased  and  environmental  impacts  have 

increase to euro 45.00 per metric ton until 2025 and increase further thereafter. On 

become more important in the decision making of investors, lenders, regulators and 

January 1, 2023 the Carbon Dioxide Cost Sharing Act came into effect, according to 

consumers. As a result, the Company does not only face changing physical climate risks 

but also transitional climate risks resulting from changes in investor and consumer 

demand, from regulatory changes as well as from other societal factors. 

The  Company  faces  several  physical  climate-related  risks.  As  a  result  of  changing 

climate patterns severe weather events in the group’s regions become more likely and 

severe, which may result in more frequent flooding or other weather-related damages. 

The  Company  actively  attempts  to  identify  these  risks  and  implement  measures  to 

mitigate the impact of such risks to the Company, for example through insurance. To 

better understand the Company’s exposure to physical risks, the company has adopted 

a  tool  for  asset-level  assessment  of  physical  risk  develop.  This  analysis  will  serve 

the Company in determining which risks are material in order to develop adaptation 

solutions. However, it cannot be guaranteed that the Company correctly identifies all 

risks  and  therefore  may  be  underinsured  against  such  risks.  Furthermore,  increased 

occurrence of severe weather events will likely result in higher insurance premiums. In 

addition, increased flood risk as well as increasing sea levels put increased stress on 

dikes, levees and related infrastructure which will likely result in higher costs for such 

infrastructure which in turn may lead to higher fees and taxes to fund the increased 

costs, particularly impacting the group’s assets situated in regions affected by increased 

flood risk and/or rising sea levels. While the above-mentioned insurance costs, taxes 

and fees can generally be passed on to tenants through the service charges, in case of 

vacancies such costs are carried by the Company. 

which the landlord will be obliged to bear part of the costs (previously carried in full 
by tenants). The CO2 costs will be divided equally between tenant and landlord, unless 
another split is negotiated in the lease agreement. From 2025 a similar tiered model 

is planned also for non-residential buildings. The shifting of some or all of the relevant 

costs to landlords will have a negative effect on the Company’s operating margins and 

financial results. 

Emerging regulations in the Group’s regions pursuing a phase-out of fossil fuels and 

improved energy efficiency present technological risks to the Company which requires 

careful attention when planning maintenance and capex measures. Some examples 

are  Germany’s  Building  Energy  Act  (GEG),  which  bans  the  installation  of  new  oil 

heating systems in 2026, whereas the UK Government announced in September 2023 

several coming changes to the Heat and Buildings Strategy, one notable point being 

delaying the banning the installation of gas boilers from 2026 now until 2035. At the 

EU level, the EU Council and EU Parliament reached an agreement in December 2023 

on the recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) to include new 

minimum energy performance requirements for buildings that progressively increase 

over time, although the specific requirements can only be known once national-level 

implementation commences among member states who will define their own target 

pathways.  Noncompliance with the energy requirements under the new EPBD would 

result in an inability to let the assets and requires increased capital expenditures to 

become compliant. In the UK the Domestic Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard limits 

letting of properties with EPC ratings F or G, and although a bill for more aggressive

the Group fails to meet expectations and trends related to sustainability aspects in a 

timely manner or at all, there could be a decline in demand from tenants. Furthermore, 

this could also lead to investors divesting from the Group’s bonds or shares, as they 

also  expect  ESG  goals  to  be  met.  From  a  regulatory  perspective,  failure  to  achieve 

the sustainability goals may also have a negative impact on the Group. For example, 
the introduction of the CO2 levy, minimum energy performance standards or further 
tightening  of  regulatory  requirements  to  achieve  alignment  with  the  targets  of  the 

Paris  Agreement  could  directly  or  indirectly  increase  the  Group’s  costs  or  decrease

enabling further emission reductions down the line.

environmental targets, the Group is developing an investment program, which covers 

a  wide  variety  of  activities  involving  both  energy  efficiency  improvements  and 

renewable energy projects. The size and scope of the investment program depends on 

the availability of governmental subsidies and grants, as is also subject to increasing 

cost of material. Furthermore, potential new requirements set by the regulators or set 

as a market standard, could increase the amount the Company would need to invest 

and potentially accelerate the execution time of the investment program.

Related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  Recommendations  framework.  Although  the

Under cross-currency contracts, the Group agrees to exchange cash flows 

in  different  currencies  calculated  on  agreed  notional  principal  amounts. 

Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing foreign

The fair value of cross-currency swaps at the reporting date is determined 

by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date 

and the credit risk inherent in the contract and is disclosed below. 

As  the  critical  terms  of  the  cross-currency  swap  contracts  and  their

REPORT OF THE RÉVISEUR 
D’ENTREPRISES AGRÉÉ
Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Aroundtown S.A. and its 
subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial 
position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of 
cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, 
including material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023 
and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the 
year then ended in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the EU Regulation N° 537/2014, the Law 
of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International 
Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de 
Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the EU Regulation 
N° 537/2014, the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the 
CSSF are further described in the « Responsibilities of “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” 

for the audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are 
also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by 
the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for 
Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most 
significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. 

Valuation of Investment Properties

a) Why the matter was considered to be one of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023?

241

We refer to the accounting policies at note 2.3 “Significant accounting judgments, 

b) How the matter was addressed during the audit?

estimates and assumptions”, note 3.13 “Investment Property”, note 3.15 “Non-current 

assets held for sale” and note 15 “Investment Property” in the consolidated financial 

statements of Aroundtown SA.

As at 31 December 2023 the Group held a portfolio of investment property with a fair 

value of MEUR 24,632.4 (31 December 2022: MEUR 27,981.0) and investment property 

within assets held for sale with a fair value of MEUR 909.1 (31 December 2022: MEUR 

1,009.3).

The valuation of investment property is a significant judgement area and is underpinned 

by a number of assumptions. 

The  fair value measurement of investment property is inherently subjective and requires 

valuation experts and the Group’s management to use certain assumptions regarding 

rates of return on the Group’s assets, future rent, occupancy rates, contract renewal terms, 

the probability of leasing vacant areas, asset operating expenses, the tenants’ financial 

stability and the implications of any investments made for future development purposes 

in order to assess the future expected cash flows from the assets. Any change in the 

assumptions used to measure the investment property could cause a significant change 

in its fair value.

The Group uses external valuation reports issued by external independent professionally 

qualified valuers to determine the fair value of its investment property. 

The external valuers were engaged by management and performed their work in 

compliance with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation – 

Professional Standards, TEGoVA European Valuations Standards and IVSC International 

Valuation Standard. The Valuers used by the Group have considerable experience of the 

markets in which the Group operates. In determining a property’s valuation, the valuers 

Our procedures over valuation of investment properties include but are not limited to 
the following:
 - We  tested  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  key  controls  around  the 
determination  and  monitoring  of  the  fair  value  measurement  of  the  investment 
properties;

 - We assessed the competence, capabilities, qualifications, independence and integrity 
of the external valuers and read their terms of engagement by Aroundtown SA to 
determine whether there were any matters that might have affected their objectivity 
or may have imposed scope limitations on their work;

 - Through the involvement of our internal property valuation specialist, on a sample 
basis,  we  tested  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  inputs  used  by  the  external 
valuers, as well as appropriateness of valuation parameters used, such as discount 
capitalisation rates, market rents per square meter and capital expenditure, vacancy 
rates, comparable price per square meter and development cost;

 - In case a valuation was performed considering the highest and best use, we assessed, 
on a sample basis, the appropriateness of the special assumptions considered, and 
whether  these  assumptions  were  technically  possible,  legally  permissible  and 
financially feasible;

 - Through the involvement of our internal property valuation specialist, on a sample 
basis,  we  assessed  the valuation  process  and  significant  assumptions  and  critical 
judgement  areas  by  benchmarking  the  key  assumptions  to  external  industry  data 
and comparable property transactions, in particular the yields applied;

 - We  considered  the  adequacy  of  the  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial 
statements,  and  the  Group’s  descriptions  regarding  the  inherent  degree  of 
subjectivity and the key assumptions in estimates.

take into account property-specific characteristics and information such as the current 

Other information

tenancy agreements and rental income. They apply assumptions for yields and estimated 

market rent, which are influenced by prevailing market yields and comparable market 

transactions, to arrive at the final valuation. 

The significance of the estimates and judgments involved, coupled with the fact that 

only a small percentage difference in individual property valuations, when aggregated, 

could result in a material misstatement in the consolidated statement of profit or loss 

and consolidated statement of financial position, warrants specific audit focus in this area.

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information stated in the consolidated report including the consolidated 
management report and the Corporate Governance Statement but does not include 
the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d’enStreprises 
agréé” thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other 
information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

242

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in 
this regard.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for 
the consolidated financial statements 

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Board of Directors is responsible for presenting [and marking up] the consolidated 
financial statements in compliance with the requirements set out in the Delegated 
Regulation 2019/815 on European Single Electronic Format (“ESEF Regulation”).

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible 
for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial 
reporting process.

Responsibilities of the réviseur d’entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements

The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU Regulation N° 537/2014, 
the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 

reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these consolidated financial statements.

Our responsibility is to assess whether the consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared in all material respects with the requirements laid down in the ESEF 
Regulation.

As part of an audit in accordance with the EU Regulation N° 537/2014, the Law of 23 July 
2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 - Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial 
statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control.

 - Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

 - Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of 

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

 - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors‘ use of the going concern 
basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  our  report  of  the “réviseur  d‘entreprises 
agréé”  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such 
disclosures  are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  opinion.  Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the “réviseur d‘entreprises agréé”. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a 
going concern.

 - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial 
statements,  including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  consolidated  financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.

 - Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of 
the  entities  and  business  activities  within  the  Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the 
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion..

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate 
threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

We have been appointed as “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” by the Shareholders on 15 
December 2023 and the duration of our uninterrupted engagement, including previous 
renewals and reappointments, is seven years.  

The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial 
statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.     

The Corporate Governance Statement is included in the management report. The 
information required by Article 68ter paragraph (1) letters c) and d) of the law of 19 
December 2002 on the commercial and companies register and on the accounting 
records and annual accounts of undertakings, as amended, is consistent with the 
consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements.

We confirm that the audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit 
committee or equivalent.

We confirm that the prohibited non-audit services referred to in the EU Regulation 
N° 537/2014 were not provided and that we remained independent of the Group in 
conducting the audit.

243

We have checked the compliance of the consolidated financial statements of the Group 
as at 31 December 2023 with relevant statutory requirements set out in the ESEF 
Regulation that are applicable to consolidated financial statements.

For the Group it relates to:

•  Consolidated financial statements prepared in a valid xHTML format;

•  The XBRL markup of the consolidated financial statements using the core taxonomy 

and the common rules on markups specified in the ESEF Regulation.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of Aroundtown SA as at 31 
December 2023, identified as 529900H4DWG3KWMBMQ39-2023-12-31-en.zip, have 
been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the requirements laid down 
in the ESEF Regulation.

Our audit report only refers to the consolidated financial statements of Aroundtown SA 
as at 31 December 2023, identified as 529900H4DWG3KWMBMQ39-2023-12-31-en.zip, 
prepared and presented in accordance with the requirements laid down in the ESEF 
Regulation, which is the only authoritative version.
