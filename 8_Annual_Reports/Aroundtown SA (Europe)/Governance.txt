Our water management strategy is described in the section above. In order to track 

the progress of our approach, we collect water consumption data from our assets 

and  monitor  this year  on year  as  shown  in  tables  5  and  6.  Due  to  restrictions  on 

tenant data sharing, we include tenant submeters in our landlord-obtained water 

consumption figures.

In 2023, we continued to conduct biodiversity studies at our sites to assess the types 

and extent of species we have onsite and to identify opportunities for biodiversity 

enhancement  on  and  around  our  assets.  In  Germany,  as  part  of  our  employee 

engagement  program,  ‘Activate  the  Base’,  some  colleagues  formed  a  biodiversity 

taskforce  aiming  to  kick-off  the  biodiversity  studies  in  Germany  after  they  were 

piloted  in  the  Netherlands  in  2022.  Four  assets  were  assessed  in  Berlin  in  2023, 

for which implementation projects of the identified improvement measures will be 

rolled out in 2024.  

Meanwhile,  our  Dutch  operations  conducted  17  biodiversity  studies  across  eight 

cities,  compared  to  seven  studies  conducted  in  2022.  Following  the  results,  and 

carefully  considering  both  the  urban  landscape  of  the  corresponding  assets  and 

the  practical  feasibility  of  the  identified  possible  measures,  three  biodiversity 

enhancement projects took place in the Netherlands in 2023. These included the 

installation  of  bat,  hedgehog,  squirrel  and  bird  houses,  insect  hotels,  green  roofs, 

and the planting of local flora and fauna. For 2024, further biodiversity studies have 

already been planned for the Netherlands.

Finally, we continued to expand our ‘Aroundtown buzzes’ program to protect urban 

bee populations in and around our assets. The program was initiated in 2020 with 

15  rooftop  beehives  across  our  commercial  properties.  By  2023,  we  had  43  bee 

colonies across 11 roofs in our portfolio. These also include four roofs in our hotel 

portfolio which we added to this program, in collaboration with the hotel tenants. 

The bees are looked after by our very own registered beekeeper.

EU TAXONOMY

Introduction

The  EU  Taxonomy  is  a  classification  system  for  the  identification  of  sustainable 

economic  activities  established  by  the  European  Commission.  Its  purpose  is  to 

offer companies, investors and policymakers a standard set of definitions for which 

economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable in order to create 

security  for  investors,  protect  against  greenwashing  and  encourage  investment 

into  more  sustainable  activities.  The  EU  Taxonomy  is  currently  comprised  of  six 

environmental objectives: Climate Change Mitigation; Climate Change Adaptation; 

Sustainable Use and Protection of Water and Marine Resources; Transition to Circular 

Economy; Pollution Prevention and Control; and the Protection and Restoration of 

Biodiversity and Ecosystems. The technical screening criteria for the six EU Taxonomy 

environmental  objectives  were  scheduled  for  release  over  a  multiyear  timeframe. 

The Climate Delegated Act covering the technical screening criteria for a substantial 

contribution to Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change Adaptation and the 

Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria for the remaining environmental objectives 

was  approved  in  2021  and  applied  as  of  January  2022.  The  final  Environmental 

and  its  reporting  requirements,  several  training  sessions  were  conducted  with  the 

Construction  and  Operation  Departments  in  Germany,  as  well  as  the  Netherlands, 

Greece  and  Cyprus  throughout  2023.  At  Aroundtown,  the  standard  construction 

contract was also recently revised to ensure the accessibility of information necessary 

for EU Taxonomy compliance, incorporating provisions for contractors to deliver data 

pertinent to EU Taxonomy reporting. The updated contract includes the EU Taxonomy 

pollution  prevention  questionnaire  (to  be  signed  by  contractors)  which  covers  the 

DNSH criteria on Pollution Prevention and Control, and integrates explicit provisions 

for  waste  disposal  and  recycling  data,  covering  the  Circular  Economy  requirements 

under  the  DNSH  criteria  for  Climate  Change  Mitigation.  It  also  covers  the  DNSH 

technical specifications for water appliances so that in the future all refurbishment 

activities that affect water appliances must align – if economically possible – to the 

specifications of the EU Taxonomy. The new contract has taken effect from January 

2024 for Aroundtown, while GCP is currently undertaking the contract update check, 

which is also expected to be rolled out during 2024.

Methodology

Approach Taken to Determine Taxonomy-Eligible Activities

In order to determine EU Taxonomy eligibility,  Aroundtown first identified all activities 

undertaken by the Group during an initial assessment conducted in 2021 involving 

multiple  departments.  Subsequently,  the  Sustainability  Department  has  reviewed 

remaining environmental objectives - Sustainable Use and Protection of Water and 

Marine Resources; Transition to Circular Economy; Pollution Prevention and Control; 

and the Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity and Ecosystems – in June 2023, 

clarified that only Circular Economy provided additional economic activities for the 

real estate and construction sector. These new activities are:

the activities to determine whether the list was still up to date. In 2022, we changed 

 ● Construction of new buildings (3.1)

our reporting of photovoltaic systems, which were previously reported under activity 

 ● Renovation of existing buildings (3.2)

4.1 (electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology) to reporting under 

activity  7.6  (installation,  maintenance  and  repair  of  renewable  energy  systems) 

following further clarification published by the European Commission in December 

2022. In 2023, Aroundtown continued to follow the established methodology.

 ● Demolition and wrecking of buildings and other structures (3.3)

 ● Maintenance of roads and motorways (3.4)

 ● Use of concrete in civil engineering (3.5)

Hence,  the  following  seven  EU  Taxonomy-eligible  activities  were  determined  as 

Of these activities, only 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 apply to Aroundtown and are considered as

 ● Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, 

regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings (7.5)

 ● Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy systems (7.6)

 ● Acquisition and ownership of buildings (7.7). 

Despite the activities’ contribution to both objectives, Aroundtown considers itself 

with suppliers to provide better recycling data, which has already been added as a 

data delivery requirement to Aroundtown’s construction contract template in 2023. 

Attributing Data to Economic Activities

Although  our  Construction  and  Operations  Departments  started  to  put  into  place 

processes in 2022 that allow for the allocation of projects or activities to the relevant 

economic  activities,  the  majority  of  invoices  had  to  be  analyzed  and  evaluated 

as contributing more to Climate Change Mitigation than Climate Change Adaptation 

manually for eligibility and alignment.  Using determined commodity codes relevant

to  each  identified  economic  activity  based  on  information  provided  in  guidelines

Assessment of Aligned Activities

For an economic activity to be aligned with the EU Taxonomy, three requirements 

need to be fulfilled:

1.  

it must make a substantial contribution to the achievement of one or more EU 

environmental objectives (“substantial contribution”)

2.  

it  does  not  significantly  harm  any  other  EU  environmental  objective  (“do  no 

significant harm / DNSH”)

3.  

it is in compliance with minimum social standards on topics such as Human 

Rights, Labor Standards and Anti-Corruption (“minimum social safeguards”)

Germany has created an issue for reporting. Aroundtown closely follows the sector’s 

debate on the topic and has reviewed and assessed several methodologies presented 

by industry organizations and an external service provider to the real estate sector. 

After thorough review of the available methodologies, Aroundtown has adopted the 

15%  benchmark  approach  based  on  data  published  by  a  publicly  available  index, 

that  has  been  endorsed  by  the  German  Sustainable  Building  Council  (DGNB),  a 

non-profit focused on making buildings more sustainable. The index uses average 

yearly  primary  energy  consumption  data  per  asset  type  from  its vast  database  of 

European clients’ consumption data to establish top 15% and top 30% benchmarks 

for Germany, the UK, Benelux and other countries. We note that this approach was 

adopted for the German portfolio only, whereas for the Dutch and London portfolios

business levels at Aroundtown. Whereas substantial contribution to Climate Change 

Mitigation  is  assessed  at  the  individual  asset  or  project  level,  the  DNSH  criteria 

apply rather to the economic activity itself. The DNSH criteria for Climate Change 

Adaptation and Circular Economy was conducted for Aroundtown as a whole. 

Hence, aligned turnover and OpEx was only calculated in relation to the properties 

that  fall  within  the  top  15%  of  building  stock  (German  portfolio)  or  have  an  EPC 

rating  A  and  above  (Dutch  and  UK  portfolio).  However,  due  to  issues  with  data

As mentioned above, in order for an economic activity to be aligned, the EU Taxonomy 

Regarding  activity  7.2  (Renovation  of  existing  buildings),  substantial  contribution 

criteria  to  Climate  Change  Mitigation  were  met,  however,  not  all  DNSH  could  be 

fulfilled, in particular the criteria for Protection of Water and Marine Resources. This 

stems  to  a  great  degree  from  a  lack  of  relevant  data  available  for  both  areas – 

areas in which Aroundtown Group is highly dependent on information provided by 

contractors and suppliers. The Group mainly faced challenges regarding the lack of 

readily available technical information of bathroom and kitchen appliances, which 

is oftentimes not indicated in contracts or invoices by contractors. 

Despite  these  challenges,  Aroundtown  has  worked  consistently  on  setting  up 

processes and gathering the necessary data for relevant DNSH criteria, in particular 

those for the environmental objectives of Protection of Water and Marine Resources. 

Aroundtown  is  committed  to  improving  access  to  data  relevant  for  EU Taxonomy 

reporting through continued engagement with contractors and suppliers. We note 

that this DNSH criteria does not apply to residential properties and can therefore be 

omitted in alignment checks of our residential portfolio held by our subsidiary GCP.

The other DNSH criteria related to the environmental objectives of Climate Change 

Adaptation, Circular Economy, and Pollution Prevention were met for 7.2 (Renovation 

of  existing  buildings),  the  assessments  of  which  are  described  further  below.  We

turn below.

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report76

 ● Climate Change Adaptation: All economic activities in category 7 (construction 
and real estate), require that a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment 
is conducted following the steps laid out in Appendix A of the Delegated Act.4 
Please refer to the section on Climate Change Adaptation in this report for further 
information on this assessment and the adoption of relevant adaptation solutions. 

 ● Protection of Water and Marine Resources: Water appliances for bathrooms and 
kitchens need to follow specifications on maximum water flow and flush volume 
outlined in Appendix E of the EU Taxonomy Regulation5. As this DNSH is not fulfilled 
for 7.2 (Renovation of existing buildings) for AT in 2023 due to lack of data on 
installed appliances, the activity is only reported as aligned for our residential 
portfolio GCP, for which this DNSH does not apply. 

 ● Transition to a Circular Economy: At least 70% by weight of non-hazardous 
construction and demolition waste generated on the construction site are prepared 
for reuse, recycling and other material recovery. Aroundtown complies with national 
legislation on recycling requirements, and so do its renovation projects in Germany. 
The German Circular Economy Act Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz (KrWG), which implements 
EU Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, as well as its amending Directive 2018/851/EU6 
stipulates a recycling rate of 70% by weight for construction and demolition waste.   

 ● Pollution Prevention and Control: In order to prevent pollution through toxic and 
environmentally harming chemicals, non-financial undertakings are required to 
confirm that a number of chemical substances mentioned in Appendix C of the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation7 are not manufactured, placed on the market or being used 
in any economic activity. As this DNSH criteria is relevant for three of our economic 
activities – 7.1 (Construction of new buildings), 7.2 (Renovation of existing buildings) 
and 7.3 (Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficient equipment) – the 
Group has created a questionnaire outlining the specifications of Appendix C which 
has been sent to our largest contractors to confirm non-usage of these chemicals 
in our building materials and at our construction sites. It has been made clear in 
the European Commission’s FAQ document from December 20228 that such proof 
must come from the supplier itself.

Minimum Social Safeguards

The EU Taxonomy states that activities may not qualify as environmentally sustainable 
unless they comply with minimum social safeguards. This requires alignment with 
the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles 
on  Business  and  Human  Rights,  as  well  as  the  fundamental  conventions  of  the 
International Labor Organization (ILO) and the International Bill of Human Rights.

Aroundtown  has  several  corporate  policies  in  place  that  refer  to  these  international 
standards and frameworks to ensure alignment with these social minimum safeguards. 
These policies include our Human Rights Policy, the Business Partner Code of Conduct 
and Employee Code of Conduct, as well as the Anti-Corruption Policy. Further, the Group’s 
compliance trainings for employees include topics of corruption and fair business.

To assess the alignment of this framework to the required minimum safeguards, in 
particular on the topic of human rights, the Group has made reference to the report 
of the Platform on Sustainable Finance9 of October 2022, in which two criteria to 
determine compliance with the safeguards were established. These are:

1.   That the company has established adequate human rights due diligence (HRDD) 

processes,  as  outlined  in  the  UNGPs  and  OECD  Guidelines  for  Multi-national 

Enterprises (MNE).

2.   That there are no indications that the company does not adequately implement 

HRDD, resulting in human rights abuses.

Demonstrating adequate HRDD for the purposes of the first criterion requires that 
the following six key steps have been implemented:

Six-Steps of Human Rights Due Diligence

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

6.

Adopting and embedding a commitment to Human Rights Due Diligence into 
policies and procedures

Identification and assessment of adverse impacts, including through stakeholder 
engagement

Taking actions to cease, prevent, mitigate and remediate adverse impacts

Tracking the implementation of these actions and its results

Communicating publicly on the approach of HRDD and actions taken to avoid and 
address adverse impacts

Providing or cooperating in remediation, incl. establishing or participating in 
grievance mechanisms where individuals and groups  
can raise concerns about adverse impacts

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report77

Aroundtown has addressed and implemented these six steps through embedding 

published  on  6  July  2021  and  updated  by  Commission  Delegated  Regulation 

the  topic  of  Human  Rights  in  its  policies,  including  the  Human  Rights  Policy,  as 

2023/2486 of 27 June 2023. In general, all three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

of information. Besides our desk-based due diligence checks, our construction and 

operation  managers  are  fulfilling  their  legal  monitoring  obligation  during  the 

execution of the project according to the national law of the project location. Finally, 

through Aroundtown’s whistle-blowing system that is accessible to employees and 

externals, potential human rights violations may be reported. 

Any reports are tracked and investigated by our Compliance Department. Following 

an internal investigation procedure as documented in our Investigation Policy for 

handling  potential  violations,  employees  or  business  partners  receive  a  warning, 

are fined, or banned from doing further business with the Group, should the claim 

be confirmed. Aroundtown may also decide to consult with authorities if necessary.

Please  also  see  the  section  ‘Fair  Business  and  Compliance’  and  the  subsection 

‘Management of Supplier Relationships’ in the Governance part of this report, which 

provide  further  information  on  compliance  with  social  minimum  safeguards  on 

corruption and fair business. 

None of the negative indicators described by the Platform on Sustainable Finance 

report  with  regard  to  human  rights,  corruption,  fair  business  and  taxation  for 

the  second  criterion  are  applicable  to  AT.  We  therefore  assess  that  this  criterion 

The definition of the Turnover KPI pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation:

Numerator

Share of turnover derived from products and services associated 
with EU Taxonomy-aligned activities.

Denominator

Total net turnover, calculated in accordance with “IAS 1.82 a) 
Revenue” and consistent with the accounting principles applied 
to the preparation of the Group’s financial statement. 

Please see the consolidated financial statements starting page 
158 of this report.

The only activity from which revenue is derived that is deemed to be EU Taxonomy-

eligible  is  activity  7.7  (Acquisition  and  ownership  of  buildings).  Aroundtown’s 

turnover consists to a great degree of revenue generated from rental income and 

operating income. The Group also derives a comparatively small amount of other 

income that is not related to eligible economic activities, which is not counted in 

the numerator but is included in the denominator. Other revenue includes mainly 

management fee, consulting fees as well as income from loans in connection with

real estate transactions.

implemented as required by Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy.

Calculation of Key Performance Indicators

Aroundtown’s denominator is taken from “revenue” from the Consolidated Statement 

of Profit or Loss.

Based on the determination above of EU Taxonomy-eligible activities, Aroundtown 
calculated the proportions of eligible and non-eligible activities, and the proportion 
of  these  eligible  activities  which  is  aligned,  in  accordance  with  the  calculation 
methodologies  defined  in  the  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  2021/2178 

Aligned  turnover  is  calculated  as  the  sum  of  turnover  generated  firstly,  from 

Aroundtown  Group’s  properties  that  fall  within  the  15%  top  building  stock  in 

Germany based on the previously described method and index and secondly, from 

Dutch and UK assets that have an EPC label A or higher.

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report78

OpEx KPI

The definition of the OpEx KPI pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation:

properties that fall within the 15% top building stock in Germany or are labeled with 

an EPC A or higher in the Netherlands and the UK. 

OpEx  linked  to  research  and  development  cannot  be  allocated  to  individual

CapEx KPI

•  training and other human resources adaptation needs

The definition of the CapEx KPI pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation:

Numerator

•  direct non-capitalized costs that represent research and 

development

2.  Part of the CapEx plan (expand / upgrade of activities)

3.  Related to the purchase of output from EU Taxonomy-

aligned economic activities 

4.  Related to measures allowing activities to be carried out 
in a low-carbon manner or with reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions and individual building renovation measures

5.  Part of OpEx for the adaptation of economic activities to 

climate change

Total operating expenditure, as the sum of direct non-
capitalized costs, including:

1.  Research and development

2.  Building renovation measures

3.  Short-term lease

4.  Maintenance and repair

Denominator

5.  Any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day 

servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment by the 
undertaking or third party.

Please see the consolidated financial statements starting page 
158 of this report.   

As such the denominator of the OpEx KPI is defined differently and is comprised 

of  specific  expenses  summarized  in  “property  operating  expenses”  disclosed  in 

the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss of this report. The OpEx denominator 
amount is therefore not mentioned as such in the financial statement.

OpEx  is  considered  as  overall  operating  expenses  that  is  linked  to  activitiy  7.7 

(Acquisition and ownership of buildings) and therefore to the overall maintenance 

and day-to-day servicing of properties.

Hence, the calculation of the aligned OpEx is linked, to the extent possible, to the

4.  Related to measures allowing activities to be carried out 
in a low-carbon manner or with reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions

5.  Part of the CapEx for adaptation of economic activities to 

climate change

Total capital expenditure, as the sum of: 

1.  Additions to tangible and intangible assets during the 

financial year considered before depreciation, amortization 
and any re-measurements, including:

•  IAS 16.73 e) i) and iii) Property, Plant and Equipment

•  IAS 38.118 e) i) Intangible Assets

•  IAS 40.76 a) and b) Investment Property (for the fair 

value model)

•  IAS 40.79 d) i) and ii) Investment Property (for the cost 

model)

•  IAS 41.50 b) and e) Agriculture

•  IFRS 16.53 h) Leases (leases that do not lead to the 

recognition of a right-of-use over the asset shall not be 
counted as CapEx)  

2.  Revaluations and impairments, additions resulting from 
business combinations and excluding fair value change

equipment) as well as capital expenditure on investment property and acquisition 

on investment property both from note 13 (investment property).  

The  EU  Taxonomy-aligned  CapEx  comprises  costs  incurred  from  economic 

activities 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6. Where refurbishment, energy efficiency projects 

or renewable energy projects last for several years, only those expenses that were 

capitalized in the relevant reporting year are calculated as EU Taxonomy-eligible 

or aligned CapEx.

CapEx  linked  to  activities  7.4  and  7.6  mostly  relates  to  infrastructure  costs  of 

necessary modernization, upgrades or technical equipment of the properties prior 

to the installation of EV charging stations or PV systems respectively. The majority 

of CapEx is currently invested by our partner company. CapEx linked to activity 7.7 

represents acquisitions of new assets in 2023. The CapEx numerator did not include 

CapEx as part of a CapEx plan.

OUR WORKFORCE:
LABOR STANDARDS AND EMPLOYEE TOPICS

Long-term Targets

 ● Be among the top ten most attractive employers in the commercial real estate 

sector by 2030

 ● Maintain zero incidents of discrimination

 ● Offer a minimum of 12hrs of training and development opportunities per FTE 

per year

2024 Goals

 ● Implement our newly developed staff career path to create more transparency on 

development opportunities

Policy, Anti-Discrimination Policy, Human Rights Policy, Anti-Corruption Policy and 

Whistleblowing Policy – all allow us to manage impacts, risks and opportunities 

relating to our workforce. These policies cover all of our own employees and were 

developed with the interests of our employees in mind. Our social policies detail 

our  commitments  to  the  protection  of  our  employees’  human  rights,  health  and 

safety,  and  protection  against  discrimination  and  harassment.  They  also  detail 

how  our  employees  should  keep  us  safe  in  relation  to  corruption  and  bribery 

prevention. The centralization of our HR Department ensures that processes and 

policies are standardized across the Group, meaning that knowledge and talents 

are effectively used across the board.  

Following the request from our employees, in 2023, we developed staff career 

paths, including specific KPIs, which intend to create a clear structure and more 

transparency  regarding  career  and  development  opportunities  at  Aroundtown. 

These career paths are expected to be communicated and applied from spring 

2024. We  also  ensure  all  our  employees  are  paid  adequate  wages  in  line  with 

applicable benchmarks.

It is fundamental for a responsible business that everyone should feel safe and

protected,  and  we  take  significant  steps  to  ensure  that  our  work  environment 

has a positive impact on the health and well-being of our people. Beyond this 

foundation, we seek to excel in factors such as career development, education, 

work-life balance, well-being, and diversity and inclusion, which are required to 

attract and retain today’s top talent. The interests, views and rights of our own 

employees primarily relate to human rights and health and safety. Our approach 

to the protection of our workforce is explained in the following section.  

We engage with our employees in a number of ways, primarily through our annual 

employee engagement survey which allows us to obtain direct feedback from all 

employees. We also conduct regular HR Roundtables during which our employees 

and managers have the opportunity to ask questions and engage directly with our 

HR Department. Our Group Head of HR is responsible for overseeing our annual 

employee  satisfaction  survey,  as  well  as  our  HR  Roundtables  and  we  use  the 

results of both to inform decisions or activities that will help manage actual and

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report85

To  ensure  straightforward  communication  with  staff  across  the  Group,  we  have 
implemented an HR software as an employee engagement tool. Through this platform, 
employees can manage personal data, holiday and home office requests, sick leave, 
and book training and participation at other company events. We are continuing to roll 
out new features to make the system more user-friendly. Our goal is for this software 
to serve as a centralized HR system across all our locations of operation, so that all our 
employees have easy and consistent access to the information they need, and to make 
the employees and the HR Department more agile.

In 2023, we conducted a survey with our employees, the results of which will guide 
our strategy to improve workplace satisfaction. The results were a clear indication 
of the engagement of our employees, with a 63% response rate across the Group. 
From  this,  we  have  identified  priority  areas  for  improvement  in  our  HR  policies, 
and we formulated an action plan for 2023 and 2024 to act on this feedback. This 
included further employee surveys to provide more opportunities for feedback and 
communication,  furthering  information  about  career  progression,  and  increased 
communication about Aroundtown’s overall strategy and vision, and the promotion 
path opportunities which employees can pursue within our organization. 

This  year,  our  commitment  to  a  positive  work  environment  was  reflected  by  two 
key milestones. Aroundtown was awarded ‘Top Company 2024’ by Kununu, a leading 
platform  for  employer  reviews  and  feedback  on  corporate  culture,  compensation 
schemes,  and  overall  employee  satisfaction.  This  placed  us  among  the  top  5% 
of  all  employer  profiles  in  the  platform  in  2023 –  a  confirmation  of  our  strong 
engagement for a great working environment and the satisfaction of our employees. 
Our subsidiary, GCP, was chosen as ‘Most Wanted Start 2024’ by the newspaper, Die 
Zeit, and Kununu, demonstrating GCP’s position as a leading apprenticeship company 
in Germany, highlighting our commitment to employee development. 

As  part  of  our  ongoing  efforts  to  enhance  workforce  satisfaction  and  well-being, 
our collaboration with a work-life platform in Germany continued throughout 2023. 
The  platform  extends  comprehensive  support  to  our  employees,  which  includes 
family-oriented  services  like  childcare  for  holidays,  emergencies,  daily  needs,  and 
elderly  care.  The  platform  further  enriches  the  employee  experience  by  offering 
programs  for  expecting  parents,  promoting  a  healthy  work-life  balance  through 
virtual sports courses and mental health prevention programs, and providing access 
to diverse consultations and talks on leading a healthy life, diversity and inclusion, 
and addressing discrimination concerns. These offerings align with our commitment 

Training and Development

We place great importance on delivering a broad learning and development program 

to our staff to provide them with the skills required to prosper in today’s business 

environment and further their careers. Our training is targeted to individual needs 

and  delivered  flexibly  to  meet  the  needs  of  all  our  employees. We  utilize  our  in-

house  expertise,  as  well  as  external  specialists,  to  deliver  training  ranging  from 

construction and property management to business skills and leadership training. 

Training  is  delivered  in  person,  through  online  webinars,  or  via  our  self-directed 

learning  portal,  the  Contemporary  Real  Estate  Academy  (CREA).  This  platform 

enables a unified presentation of our mandatory training content and learning and 

development material, which is accessible to all staff across our business. In 2023, 

additional features were added that allow for better communication with employees 

on training opportunities and advanced tracking of training data and the creation of 

reports for content owners and admin users from our HR Department.

We have also continued to implement performance reviews digitally through our 

HR software. Managers receive training on using the tool to provide performance 

feedback  and  can  then  provide  ratings  and  reviews  digitally.  In  2024,  we  plan 

to  relaunch  the  performance  review  tool  across  the  Aroundtown  departments 

in  Germany,  with  a  new  career  development  plan,  aiming  to  deliver  60%  of 

performance  reviews  using  this  method.  Streamlining  this  review  process  will 

allow  our  employees  to  receive  personal  feedback  more  simply  and  regularly, 

helping them to improve and progress towards their own goals.

In 2023, we also continued to expand our leadership training program, delivering 

2,430 hours of training for upcoming leaders within our organization. In addition, 

we  maintained  our  mentoring  scheme,  enabling  our  employees  to  receive 

professional  coaching  support  from  more  senior  team  members. These  programs 

sought  to  boost  individual  employee  performance  while  securing  our  long-term 

viability. The  leadership  program  is  designed  to  equip  the  company’s  current  and 

potential leaders with the fundamental critical thinking and problem-solving skills 

essential for making sound decisions. It aims to improve communication and team 

management skills, conflict resolution, as well as innovativeness and productivity. 

Employees who participate in this program are provided with the skills necessary to 

to fostering a positive and supportive work culture.

As an international company representing more than 60 nationalities, headquartered 

in  Germany,  we  also  support  our  employees  with  language  classes  in  English  and 

German. In 2023, we continued to pursue our intensive focus on language learning, 

partnering with a well-known language school to offer advanced German courses for 

non-native speakers and English for German speakers, with 3,557 hours of training 

To  contribute  further  to  the  well-being  of  our  employees,  we  offer  a  flexible 

package of benefits and working provisions, such as hybrid working arrangements 

to  support  working  from  home,  and  flexible  working  hours.  Part-time  working 

options  also  grant  greater  flexibility  for  our  employees  to  balance  their  work 

around their lives and families. Such part-time arrangements are specific to the 

provided. The language program is targeted at promoting effective communication 

employee’s needs.

and collaboration amongst employees and other stakeholders. It enhances operational 

efficiency, tears down cultural barriers, reduces misunderstandings, builds trust, and 

fosters a more inclusive workplace environment.

Occupational Health and Safety

We take our responsibility to provide a safe work environment seriously and ensure 

that  tasks  do  not  pose  undue  health  risks.  Our  Occupational  Health  and  Safety 

Policy  ensures  strict  compliance  with  all  workplace  health  and  safety  regulations 

at  national  and  EU  level.  We  are  jointly  responsible  for  occupational  health  and 

safety through the avoidance of risks to ourselves and our employees by identifying 

and reporting any unsafe working conditions, violations of safety requirements, and 

accidents  in  the  workplace. The  implementation  of  this  policy  is  overseen  by  our 

dedicated internal Office Health and Safety Manager and by the internal inspections 

of  the  occupational  safety  standards  in  our  workplaces.  We  also  undergo  ad  hoc 

external audits by state officers, but none have taken place in 2023. 

In order to manage material risks, impacts and opportunities to our workforce, we 

set targets to help mitigate these risks and maximize opportunities. In 2023, we 

increased  our  internal  budget  for  employee  training,  including  for  occupational 

health  and  safety,  with  some  employees  being  identified  as  knowledge  owners 

The wider health and well-being benefits provided include eye examinations and 

health checks carried by our company physician, access to our company gym for 

employees  at  our  Berlin  headquarters  with  courses  and  personalized  training, 

and  mental  health  appointments  available  for  all  employees  with  our  in-house 

consultant.

Furthermore,  our  collaboration  with  a  work-life  platform  mentioned  under  the 

Employee Satisfaction section also contributes to fostering a secure and supportive 

workplace environment. Offerings underpinning our commitment to occupational 

health and safety include hundreds of virtual sports and mental health prevention 

courses  covering  topics  from  mindfulness  to  resilience,  and  numerous  talks 

and  consultation  offers  promoting  a  healthy  lifestyle. Additionally,  the  platform 

provides  access  to  a  24/7  emergency  hotline  staffed  by  qualified  psychologists 

and coaches, ensuring prompt psychological support during critical situations. To 

help manage stress, specific trainings, coaching and other methods such as Open 

Space are also available.

Equal Treatment and Opportunities for All

We  are  committed  to  promoting  equal  treatment  and  opportunities  for  all 

within  our  workforce.  Our  Anti-Discrimination  Policy  specifically  addresses  the 

who then delivered training sessions themselves. The 169 certified first-aiders in 

following  grounds  for  discrimination:  race  or  ethnic  origin,  gender,  religion  or 

the Group have been trained, within the scope of first aid assistance, to respond

We monitor our employee numbers by both geographical area and contract type as 

subject to any kind of discrimination. These complaints are taken seriously and are 
duly investigated. Further, our Diversity Policy details the diversity initiatives that 

seen in tables 7 and 8 below which allows us to monitor further information and 
understand trends in employee-related data. These figures include employees who

In  2023,  as  a  result  of  the  ‘Activate  the  Base’  initiative,  a  Diversity  Committee 

comprising  employee  representatives  from  different  organizational  levels  was 

established with the aim of overseeing our commitments to diversity, inclusion and 

anti-discrimination. A dedicated site is now available in our intranet containing up-

to-date topics and information, and comprehensive diversity training is now provided 

to all employees upon joining the organization. To strengthen our commitment, the 

position of Chief Diversity Officer was also established during 2023, and is currently 

held by the Group Head of HR.

Work-Related Rights

We respect and promote human rights throughout our organization with the help of 

stringent policies and procedures. Should we operate in areas at risk of human rights 

violations,  we  have  committed  to  undertake  human  rights  due  diligence  and  risk 

assessments. We regard every person as unique, and recognize people‘s individual 

differences  such  as  ethnic  origin,  gender,  religion  or  belief,  experience,  physical 

and mental abilities, age, and sexual identity. In this way, we ensure our employees, 
tenants, and business partners, including our suppliers, respect the shared human 

rights of all people, in line with international regulations such as the International 

Labor  Organization‘s  Core  Labor  Standards,  and  the  UN  Guiding  Principles  on 

Business and Human Rights. Our policies concerning our employee’s work-related 

rights refer to forced or compulsory labor, and child labor. However, they currently do 

not explicitly refer to trafficking in human beings. We commit to duly consider this 

aspect during our policy reviews.

Metrics: Our Workforce 

As part of our commitment to improving employee satisfaction, maintaining high 

standards of health and safety, and ensuring all employees receive equal treatment 

and opportunities, we monitor and measure a series of metrics to help understand 

our progress in areas relating to our workforce. Employee data disclosed below is 

representative of the figures at the end of the reporting period and are reported in

Table 13 presents the gender pay gap within our employees. This indicator measures 
the disparity in earnings between women and men, calculated as the average gross 
hourly earnings of female employees divided in the average gross hourly earnings 
of male employees. We closely monitor and report this difference based on various 
levels of aggregation in an effort to increase transparency and conform to widely 
accepted standards. The data is split based on employee remuneration (salary and 
bonus) and basic salary in relation to employee level.

In  2023,  we  launched  several  projects  to  improve  tenant  satisfaction,  including  a 

fitness studio installed at a discounted price for tenants, which is an offer we plan to 

continue expanding in 2024. A tenant lounge at one of our properties, a discounted 

co-working  space,  and  discounts  on  hotel  accommodation  for  tenants  are  other 

examples of projects aimed to improve the overall tenant satisfaction that we plan 

to continue implementing in the coming years.

of  scooter  and  bicycle  rental  programs  for  our  tenants  as  well  as  an  improved 

parking scheme, and the installation of solar panels onsite. The renewable electricity 

generated with these panels will be made available for sale to our tenants, aiding 

them  in  reducing  their  individual  carbon  impact.  Within  our  residential  portfolio, 

awareness raising initiatives such as information videos or leaflets advice tenants 

on sustainable practices including efficient heating and ventilation.

In order to align our investments with our tenants’ needs, we tailor ongoing analysis

into  each  tenant’s  industry  segment  and  individual  success  factors.  Investments 

in  environmental  efficiency  measures  are  an  integral  part  of  this  strategy.  Larger 

corporate  tenants  often  have  sustainability  policies  which  give  preference  to 

buildings  with  higher  environmental  standards,  as  well  as  buildings  which  offer 

additional  benefits  to  employee  health  and  well-being.  To  evidence  the  green 

credentials  of  our  assets,  we  continue  to  pursue  BREEAM  certification  across  our 

commercial portfolio as shown in table 15. During 2023, we successfully certified 

100% of our Dutch office portfolio. In addition, we certified the first German offices 

during 2023, utilizing the knowledge transferred from our Dutch office certifications. 

Further certifications in German offices are ongoing and we are analyzing certification 

options in the hotel portfolio.

At the end of 2022, we carried out a tenant satisfaction survey for the commercial 

portfolio in which we asked tenants to rate their satisfaction across several areas 

such  as  rental  property  features  including  parking  and  safety,  sustainability-

related features including green space and energy efficiency, fit-outs, cost, property 

management, and onsite service. The survey showed high overall satisfaction, with 

64% of those who consented and took part answering that they were partially or 

completely  satisfied  with Aroundtown’s  service. This  rate  was  even  higher  among 

our  larger  tenants  (those  with  over  400m²  rented)  and  tenants  with  longer-term 

contracts  (those  with  7+  years’  contract  duration).  The  results  also  demonstrated 

good  satisfaction  with  our  external  service  providers,  with  the  average  ratings 

for  friendliness,  accessibility,  competence,  responsiveness  and  service  orientation 

all indicating positive satisfaction. However, in our pursuit of conducting a tenant 

survey in compliance with GDPR regulations, the scope of participation was limited, 

as we needed to acquire signed consent from each tenant to use their data.

in 2023, for which we paused the survey and focused on establishing a streamlined 

process for including consent forms in new lease contracts and amendments  of 

existing  ones.  Simultaneously,  we  initiated  the  integration  of  consent  data  into 

our  SAP  System  for  a  more  efficient  and  secure  approach.  In  parallel  to  this,  as 

the  survey  highlighted  some  areas  for  improvement,  we  rolled-out  action  plans 

informed  by  the  results,  which  will  also  guide  much  of  our  work  in  2024.  For

users, we include all tenants who can be materially impacted by our activities.

Aroundtown  now  offers  a  24/7  hotline  for  our  commercial  tenants  through  the 

Service  Center  to  provide  a  point  of  contact  outside  normal  service  hours.  We 

also started the process of developing an online service portal, in which tenants 

will be able to send requests directly into our CRM system, which speeds up the 

service process. This will be implemented in 2024 alongside a website for tenant 

services containing relevant information and features. Furthermore, we have been 

developing a Tenant Retention program in the form of a modular set of measures 

for  expanding  the  service  offerings  in  our  properties,  for  example  by  creating 

coworking  spaces,  conference  areas  or  gym  facilities.  Our  efforts  align  with  our 

dedication to providing a more dynamic tenant-centric experience, which we hope 

will be reflected in the results of future surveys.

For our properties in the Netherlands, we sent out the annual satisfaction survey 

by  email  in August,  in  cooperation  with  an  external  agency. The  survey  covered 

various aspects, including the service provided by the Service Desk, the condition 

of  the  building  and  its  surroundings,  general  sustainability  matters,  and  overall 

satisfaction.  In  2023,  the  sustainability  satisfaction  score  showed  a  significant 

improvement of 9.5% compared to 2022, while tenant involvement in sustainability 

continued  to  increase,  evidenced  through  and  facilitated  by  discussions  during 

tenant meetings. 

The overall service satisfaction has also seen a positive increase of 7.1%. To enhance 

performance further, KPIs for this department have been adjusted for the upcoming 

year,  with  the  aim  of  achieving  a  yearly  improvement  of  at  least  3%.  Across  all 

measured areas, scores have surpassed those of 2022 and it is our overall goal to 

continue to improve performance.

Tenant Health and Safety

Guaranteeing  high  standards  of  health  and  safety  within  our  buildings  is  a 

fundamental  obligation  to  our  tenants,  and  a  prerequisite  to  ensuring  their 

satisfaction with our service. Through the dedication of our property management 

teams, we work continually to instill a positive health and safety culture across our 

operations. Our ultimate goal is to protect tenants and third parties from health and 

safety  risks,  and  to  deliver  an  environment  which  is  healthy,  safe  and  motivating, 

Health and safety are central to our asset management approach at every stage of 

a  property’s  life  cycle.  At  acquisition,  we  conduct  a  comprehensive  due  diligence 

risk  assessment  which  enables  us  to  identify  risks  and  implement  preventative 

maintenance  solutions.  We  assess  the  building’s  structural  characteristics  and 

establish which refurbishment activities should be targeted, looking for opportunities 

to improve the quality and accessibility of the property. Various measures are then 

implemented to support tenants’ well-being, easier movement around the building, 

and additional communal space and services. 

The  Aroundtown  Tenant  Health  and  Safety  Policy  sets  out  our  commitment  to 

protecting the well-being of our tenants and the processes we apply through the 

asset  lifecycle,  including  hazard  assessment,  training,  fire  safety,  and  reporting. 

The  policy  details  a  three-tier  management  approach,  with  distinct  roles  and 

responsibilities assigned to our facility, property and asset management teams, and 

is in compliance with all statutory norms and safety requirements in the countries 

where we are operational.

During the operational phase, we conduct technical reviews of our properties on an 

ongoing basis, to ensure alignment with regulations and to guide future investment 

planning. Our external facility managers are tasked with operational responsibility 

for  providing  the  information  and  carrying  out  the  necessary  tasks  to  maintain 

the  technical  condition  of  our  assets.  This  encompasses  documenting  all  checks 

performed on technical installations and building structures. Reports are forwarded 

to Aroundtown, and any identified remedial works are incorporated into our annual 

budget planning for each property or addressed promptly if required. In 2023, we 

advanced  in  this  domain  by  strategically  aligning  with  two  contractors  that  are 

required to adhere to stringent health and safety reporting standards.

Our standard operating procedures for all assets guarantee complete compliance 

with  fire  and  safety  regulations.  This  involves  investigating  and  documenting 

safety incidents. We regularly commission the legally required assessments from 

external fire safety specialists as well as conduct statutory checks with the regional 

fire brigade. If deficits are identified, these are documented and reported to the 

Head of Technical Property Management, who is then responsible for seeing that 

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report97

the required work is carried out. The proper implementation of these corrections is 

confirmed by appropriate follow-up processes, which include an onsite inspection 

and  subsequent  clearance  report  to  the  authorities  after  the  deficits  have  been 

processed. Our objective is to safeguard tenants and third parties from health and 

safety hazards while providing a healthy, secure, and inspiring work environment 

that satisfies our tenants. 

Besides the Tenant Health and Safety Policy, our Human Rights Policy also details 

our commitment to protecting the human rights of our tenants. Although this policy 

is  currently  confidential,  it  has  been  written  in  accordance  with  the  UN  Guiding 

Principles on Business and Human Rights and in particular respects the privacy of 

our  tenants  through  data  protection  measures. Any  and  all  reported violations  of 

human rights are recorded by our Compliance Department and reported directly to 

our CEO and a member of the board of Directors. We are committed to reporting 

human rights violations and include this risk within our risk management process.

AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND  
NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT

Investors  in  the  built  environment  are  expected  to  think  beyond  their  commercial 
interest,  to  create  long-term  socio-economic  benefit  in  the  communities  they 
operate  in.  By  building  productive  relationships  with  the  local  community,  we  can 
contribute  to  the  development  of  prosperous  neighborhoods,  which  in  turn  will 
benefit  our  properties  and  their  tenants.  The  principal  interests,  views  and  rights 
of our local communities relate to affordability, engagement and human rights. We 
actively engage with the wider communities surrounding and within our properties 
to promote neighborliness and connection. Our approach to meeting the needs of our 
communities is underpinned by our Community Involvement and Development Policy.

Long-Term Targets

 ● Invest up to €1 million p.a. in community projects via the Aroundtown and GCP 

Foundations

 ● Build partnerships with local stakeholders to achieve targeted impact with 

communities around Group assets

local communities’ needs. This includes the projects sponsored by the Aroundtown 

and  GCP  Foundations,  and  open  and  meaningful  engagement  and  consultation 

opportunities  with  external  stakeholders.  Thus,  active  community  contributions 

are one of our key priorities moving into 2024. 

Our  investment  approach  of  targeting  properties  with  value-add  potential  sees 

us  invest  in  properties  in  need  of  retrofitting  with  broader  opportunities  for 

ESG  improvements.  These  types  of  assets  provide  significant  potential  to  deliver 

improvements for the properties’ tenants and nearby residents through investment 

in  building  systems  and  facilities,  shared  services,  aesthetics  of  external  facades 

and  improved  maintenance. We  strive  to  create  spaces  for  dialogue  with  existing 

tenants  and  local  authorities  as  soon  as  an  asset  is  acquired,  to  determine  how 

the needs and concerns of the community can be addressed through the long-term 

asset strategy. These community consultations are usually in the form of meetings 

and workshops. 

 ● Support measures that aim to achieve several of the United Nations Sustainable 

Neighborhood Development and Community Engagement

Development Goals (UN SDGs)

2024 Goals

 ● Achieve a level of community investment through the Aroundtown and GCP 

Foundations of at least €500 thousand p.a. 

 ● Continue supporting employee volunteering through the company-wide ‘Social

of the portfolio, for instance, hold regular community events, host liaison activities 

with schools, and provide support to local charities, for example by providing spaces 

free of charge to promote and raise funds for their cause. Our subsidiary, GCP, takes a 

proactive approach to engagement in the communities surrounding the residential 

properties they invest in. This year their activities/events have included:

Some  of  these  events  have  been  a  tradition  for  many  years  and  always  include  a 

call  for  participation  through  multiple  channels  to  foster  engagement.  The  high 

participation numbers and the high tenant satisfaction rate on the initiatives of 97% 

reflect the great reception from the tenants, and we are proud to continue building up 

our efforts for community engagement in 2024.

Charitable Contributions

Our donation funded an artistic redesign of the passageway leading to the counseling

visiting the center, but that also enhances the neighborhood aesthetics and helps break 

spatial barriers. The foundation also supported lebensnah e.V., an association providing 

support for people with disabilities, in developing a new individualized German sign

after disasters, or in complex emergencies such as wars and conflicts. Further, with the 

support of the Aroundtown Foundation, 20 young people (15 to 16 years old) were 

able to attend a summer camp from the apropolis e.V., an association with the aim to 

encourage young people to form their own political values and opinions.

Affordable Housing

Much  of  our  community  impact  comes  from  our  residential  properties,  owned 

through  our  subsidiary,  GCP.  GCP’s  tenants  represent  a  wide  range  of  social, 

economic  and  cultural  backgrounds.  To  provide  properties  which  serve  these 

communities, we are committed to providing affordable housing, so to monitor our 

performance in this regard, the Group has developed a “rental cost portion” metric 

modeled on Eurostat’s housing cost overburden rate. This metric compares GCP’s 

median rent for residential units against the net minimum wage, reflecting salary 

after taxes and social security contributions, which  we believe is a conservative 

benchmark focusing on those most sensitive to rent affordability.  

The housing cost portion based on the median warm rent of GCP’s residential properties 

in Germany in 2023 was 39% of this benchmark, up from 38% in 2022. The warm rent 

AROUNDTOWN SA   |    Board of Directors‘ Report100

incorporates various costs of living including energy costs, and housing services, which 

Metrics: Affected Communities

GCP has no control over. The rental cost portion based on median cold rent in 2023 

for our German residential properties, excluding these factors, remained at 24% of the 

net minimum wage salary in 2023. These figures show that increased housing costs 

in 2023 were driven by utility and service cost inflation rather than increasing rental 

costs,  along  with  observations  that  wage  growth  lagged  in  the  current  inflationary 

environment. Germany has already acted to increase the minimum wage as of January 

1st, 2024, along with another increase set for 2025, which should improve housing 

affordability if the trend of a decreasing rate of inflation continues. These results are 

testament  to  the  Group’s  commitment  to  ensuring  that  our  high-quality  residential 

properties are priced affordably for all our tenants.

Modernization Rent Increases

Our subsidiary GCP launched its modernization program for its residential properties 

and is carrying a relatively small program, targeted to where it can make a significant 

impact.  As  part  of  our  commitment  to  providing  affordable  housing,  GCP  works  to 

ensure  that  modernization  cost  allocation  to  tenants  is  done  in  a  way  that  keeps 

housing affordable. To determine these cost allocations, the Rent Control and Increase 

Department analyses the current market situation and relevant regulations on cost 

allocations, to decide whether to enact rental increase waivers on the modernization 

costs. The average modernization cost allocation for our German residential properties 

in 2023 was €0.53/sqm, which is 16% lower than the legally possible cost allocation 

set out in German law.

In cases of significant rent increases, tenants can object to the cost allocation in what 

is  known  as  a  financial  hardship  case.  These  can  be  resolved  through  a  complete 

or partial waiver of the entitled rent increase for a given number of years. In 2023, 

however, zero  hardship  cases  were  received  out  of  the  1,349  units  modernized. We 

believe this low number of hardship case applications reflects the targeted approach 

to conducting modernization projects, and the careful consideration that is put into 

rent  increases  which  in  many  cases  is  partially  waived  based  on  the  company’s 

understanding  of  the  local  market  situation.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  not 

placing pressure on our tenants in cases of financial hardship, we ensure that any and 

all  changes  are  discussed  with  our  tenants  beforehand. This  transparent  and  open 

approach allows security and trusted relationships with our tenants. 

Our  dedication  to  maintaining  strong  community  connections  and  developing 

longstanding  relationships  is  demonstrated  by  our  Community  Involvement 

and  Development  Policy,  which  guides  our  efforts  towards  tenant  engagement. 

Particularly for our residential portfolio, a range of community events are organized 

such as seasonal tenant festivals and campaigns throughout the year, on site and/or 

digitally. By organizing various tenant events also digitally, our residential tenants at 

all locations have the opportunity to participate. This is enhanced by complementary 

tenant benefits, such as an additional incentive for the residential tenants loyalty 

program  or  embedding  the  digital  campaigns  in  the  GCP  app.  These  initiatives 

impact the wider community and are considered stakeholder engagement programs. 

For 2024, we strive to set up an effective tracking system that allows us to better 

measure  the  reach  of  the  initiatives  in  terms  of  actual  impact  generated  in  the 

communities -  such  as  actual  participation  rates  and  satisfaction  levels  with  the 

various programs.

integrity of the financial statements, including reporting to the Board of Directors on 

its activities and the adequacy of internal systems controlling the financial reporting 

processes  and  monitoring  the  accounting  processes,  including  reviewing  accounting 

policies and updating them regularly. 

The ESG Committee is chaired by Mr. Markus Leininger, an independent member 

of the Board of Directors, and includes as voting members independent director 

Mr. Markus Kreuter and executive director Mr. Frank Roseen, as well as advisory 

members including the Group’s Head of the Sustainability Department, Head of 

the  Energy  Department  and  Head  of  Human  Resources  Department  as  well  as 

the Chief Operating Officer of a key Group company. The ESG Committee oversees 

strategic guidance on ESG topics and is responsible for reviewing and assessing 

Aroundtown’s responsible business strategy, policies and practices with respect 

to ESG. The Committee meets at least quarterly, with additional meetings called 

as required, and sets the direction for the work of the Sustainability Department. 

The  Sustainability  Department  acts  as  a  cross-departmental  interface,  working 

across the Group to implement and monitor sustainability programs and initiatives 

at an operational level. It is led by the Head of Sustainability and reports directly 

to the CEO and to the Chairperson of the Board of Directors. The Department also 

prepares the Group’s materiality analysis and ESG reporting, as well as responds to 

enquiries by investors and rating agencies on ESG topics. It collaborates closely with 

the Energy Department, which applies its engineering expertise to implement the 

technical elements of our sustainability strategy. There are constant exchanges of 

information between departments around ESG-related aspects.

Committee are Mr. Markus Kreuter (Chairperson), Mr. Markus Leininger, Ms. Simone

Internal Controls and Risk Management Systems

The Group closely monitors and manages any potential risks and sets appropriate 

measures  to  mitigate  the  occurrence  and/or  impact  of  any  possible  failure  to  an 

acceptable level. The risk management supervision is led by the Risk Committee, which 

reviews the risk management structure, organization, processes and coordinates risk-

related training. The Group categorizes the risk management systems into two main 

categories: internal risk mitigation and external risk mitigation. The internal controls 

system and compliance of the Group is monitored by the Compliance Department.

Internal Risk Mitigation

Internal controls are constructed from five main elements: 

 ● Risk management – set by the Risk Committee and guided by an ongoing analysis 
of the organizational structure and by identifying potential weaknesses. Further, 

the committee assesses control deficiencies impacting the risk management 

framework in the organization, supported by CCO and CRO. 

 ● Control discipline – based on the organizational structure and supported by 
employee and management commitments. The discipline is erected on the 

foundations of integrity and ethical values.

 ● Control features – the Group sets physical controls, compliance checks and 
verifications such as cross departmental checks. The Group puts strong emphasis 

 ● Monitoring procedures – the Group monitors and tests unusual entries, mainly 
through a detailed monthly Actual vs. Budget analysis and additional checks. 

Strong and sustainable internal control system significantly reduces the probability 

and materiality of errors. The management sees high importance in constantly 

improving all measures, adjusting to market changes and organizational dynamics. 

 ● ESG risk-related expenditures – the Group has included the identification of 
potential financial liabilities and future expenditures linked to ESG risks in the 

enterprise risk management. Potential future expenditures on ESG matters and 

opportunities are included in the financial budget. 

The Group has established procedures to protect the confidentiality and integrity 

of management information and data across all business processes. Furthermore, 

we implemented a wide range of guidelines and provisions, with the ratification 

of  the  EU  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR),  including  enhanced 

mandatory awareness training on GDPR. The Group has implemented Standard 

Operating Procedures (SOP) to ensure that all personal data stored and processed 

in  the  course  of  the  Group’s  operations  is  safe  from  manipulation  and  misuse. 

Additionally, the Group adopted an information security and privacy strategy in 

order to maintain a high level of controls to help minimize the potential risks. 

The diligence of the Group with regards to all compliance issues presents itself 

in  the  level  of  zero  compliance-related  tolerance.  Both  our  Business  Partners 

Code of Conduct and Employee Code of Conduct can be found on our website.  

External Risk Mitigation 

Through its ordinary course of business, the Group is exposed to various external 

risks.  The  Risk  Committee  is  therefore  constantly  determining  whether  the 

appropriate infrastructure, resources and systems are in place and are adequate to 

maintain an acceptable level of risk. The potential risks and exposure are related, 

inter  alia,  to  volatility  of  interest  rate  risk,  inflation  risk,  liquidity  risk,  credit  risk, 

regulatory and legal risk, collection and tenant deficiencies, the need to unexpected 

capital investments, property damage risk, physical climate risks, market downturn 

risk and geopolitical risk. The Group sets direct, specific guidelines and boundaries 

on separation of duties as approval and payment are completed by at least two 

to mitigate and address each risk of failure or potential default, by hedging and/or 

separate parties. Payment verification is cross checked and confirmed with budget 

reducing it to an acceptable level of impact and/or occurrence.

Climate-related  risks  are  taken  into  account  throughout  the  process  described 

above.  A  comprehensive  risk  matrix  catalogue  for  each  risk  group  has  been 

compiled for the Group, including physical and transitional climate-related risks. 

Each  risk  is  rated  based  on  a  combination  of  impact  and  likelihood  resulting  in 

four rating definitions: Inherent Risk, Target Residual Risk, Target Risk Reduction

Remuneration Committee

The  Board  of  Directors  established  a  Remuneration  Committee  to  determine 

and  recommend  to  the  Board  the  Company’s  Remuneration  Policy  and  prepares 

and  recommends  to  the  Board  remuneration  proposals  for  members  of  the 

Board,  the  Executive  Directors  and  Senior  Management  including  evaluation  of 

short-  and  long-term  performance-related  remuneration  to  senior  executives. 

The  Remuneration  Committee  consists  of  the  Independent  Directors  Mr.  Markus

ESG-Linked Remuneration

The ability to quantify climate related risks depends, inter alia, on the availability 

The  Remuneration  Policy  is  recommended  to  the  Board  by  the  Remuneration 

of data and methodologies. The Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) tool is 

Committee. It applies to the Company’s executive individuals and independent and 

an emerging best practice for stranding risk assessment in the real estate sector 

and  is  a  methodology  taken  into  consideration  by  the  Group. While  CRREM  was 

found to be the most advanced tool for assessing alignment with Paris Agreement 

targets, its current methodology poses challenges limiting its practical usability 

for  landlords  to  focus  on  renovation  planning  to  address  energy  and  carbon 

intensity  under  their  own  sphere  of  influence.  The  Group  has  thus  prioritized 

applying stranding definitions based on EPCs and the EU’s climate commitments 

embodied in the EPBD recast, which grants a better understanding of investment 

actions  needed  and  the  expected  results  of  those  actions  specific  to  each  asset 

class, both in terms of their sustainability and financial impacts.

In  order  to  further  engage  stakeholders,  including  the  value  chain  and  workers 

in  our value  chain,  the  Group  intends  to  develop  a  methodology  in  2024  which 

non-executive  directors,  and  ties  Short-Term  and  Long-Term  Incentive  Programs 

to  specific  ESG  targets,  such  as  the  annual  progress  towards  Scope  1  and  2 

emissions  reductions,  the  annual  increase  of  the  proportion  of  buildings  with 

green certifications, the Group’s ESG rating, and gender equality. In 2023, the Group 

has committed to aligning the remuneration of its executive individuals with the 

requirements of the Remuneration Policy and the changes will become effective as 

of 2023 and 2024.

FAIR BUSINESS AND COMPLIANCE

Our  business  strategy  is  underpinned  by  our  fundamental  commitment  to 

ethical  conduct,  robust  corporate  governance,  and  high  levels  of  transparency. 

Safeguarding the Group from any reputational damage due to error or misconduct 

is essential in maintaining the Group’s reputation. Therefore, enforcing responsible 

behavior  guided  by  integrity  is  a  central  tool  for  the  management  in  terms  of 

its  dealings.  For  this  reason,  the  compliance  and  risk  management  teams  are 

structured accordingly and supplemented by internal review procedures, covering 

all steps of real estate investment and management chain. In order to stipulate 

ethical  behavior  throughout  its  operations,  Aroundtown  implemented  Code  of 

Conducts  for  both  its  employment  contracts  and  business  partners  contracts 

which include policies that prevent compliance violations and misconducts. These 

policies  include  Anti-Corruption,  Diversity  and  Anti-Discrimination,  Anti-Bribery, 

measures to prevent human right violations, Data Protection Declaration and User 

Policy, as well as a Whistleblowing Policy. 

This framework seeks to embed our principles of integrity, respect, performance, 

accountability, and sustainability into all of our business activities. We ensure our 

Board  of  Directors  and  senior  executives  hold  vast  experience  and  skillsets  in 

relevant business areas in order to help maintain our high governance standards.

Long-term Targets

 ● Keep our level of fair business relationships with our customers and suppliers

 ● Maintain zero tolerance towards compliance violations

2024 Goals

 ● Maintain high-level awareness and engagement with our Group policies

 ● Review and implement actions to comply with new European regulations (e.g., 

CSRD) during 2024

To  ensure  our  high  ethical  standards  are  embedded  in  our  business,  we  have 

developed  a  comprehensive  compliance  framework.  This  system  is  designed  to 

adapt to increasingly complex legal frameworks, and to protect our business from 

the risks associated with unethical conduct. The expectations and requirements of 

this framework are clearly set out through our Group-level policies and standards. 

Alignment with these standards is monitored by internal control mechanisms, and 

in case of deviations we have a clear reporting and response process.  All Group-

wide policies mentioned in this section are aligned with and approved by the Board 

of  Directors.  This  ensures  and  justifies  the  clear  statement  of  Aroundtown’s  top 

management that these policies are a crucial part of the Group and binding for each 

and every one working for and with Aroundtown.   

Our compliance and risk management teams are structured accordingly to ensure 

responsible behavior guides us, and they are supplemented by internal monitoring 

procedures, covering all steps of real estate investment and management. 

Employee Code of Conduct

At the heart of the internal policies for compliance is our Employee Code of Conduct. 

This sets out the principles of our commitment to ethical behaviour and is a contractual 

requirement for our staff at every level. The Employee Code of Conduct covers our 

standards  on  topics  including  bribery,  corruption,  fair  competition  and  anti-trust, 

conflict of interest, and discrimination. It is supplemented by topical guidelines and 

specific policies, such as the Anti-Corruption Policy, the Global Information Security 

Policy, the Diversity Policy, and the Anti-Discrimination Policy. Aroundtown is also a 

signatory of the Charta der Vielfalt (German Diversity Charter). For more information 

on our anti-discrimination efforts, please refer to the subsection Equal Treatment 

and Opportunities for All. Another crucial subject in our compliance program is the 

management of ethical standards in our supply chain as described in the section 

 ● Adherence to the Group risk management strategy by performing compliance risk 

Workers in the Value Chain.  

assessment

 ● Ensure the voluntary alignment of our Group policies to the new Supply Chain 

Act in Germany (LkSG) 

In its Employee Code of Conduct, the Group has also instruments in-place to prevent 

and fight violations of law, such as human rights violation, corruption, and bribery. 

The employees have reporting channels in case of a possible violation where the 

measures  are  dealt  with  in  confidence  to  the  full  extent  permitted  by  statutory

law.  Reported  issues  are  investigated  by  the  Compliance  Department.  Besides 

continued  alignment  to  our  high  ethical  standards  requires  a  frictionless 

the  reporting  channels,  there  is  also  a Whistleblowing  Platform  conducted  by  an 

method  for  employees’  concerns  to  be  registered,  and  this  is  the  spirit  of  our 

external  service  provider,  enabling  full  anonymity.  If  any  violation  is  to  be  found, 

“Speak  Up”  approach.  Through  it,  employees  and  external  service  providers  are

encouraged  to  voice  any  concerns  they  may  have  about  breaches  of  the  law  or 

Please refer to the subsection Our Intranet Compliance Site below. 

Aroundtown‘s  Code  of  Conduct  includes  the  prohibition  of  insider  dealing. 

Aroundtown is subject to several obligations under Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 

(Market Abuse  Regulation  (MAR)),  as  amended. Aroundtown  notifies  (including  by 

way of training sessions) pursuant to applicable provisions under MAR, all persons 

discharging  managerial  responsibilities  of  their  obligations  in  the  context  of 

managers’  transactions.  Memorandums,  notifications,  training  and  information  are 

distributed regularly.

Outstanding  leadership  is  crucial  in  this  regard.  Our  managers  are  expected  to 

be  examples  of  our  core values  of  mutual  respect  and  clear  communication. This 

standard of behavior usually shows positive effects on our commercial success, as 

contradiction of our Code of Conduct without any fear of repercussions, as dictated 

by  the  Whistleblower  Protection Act.  Issues  can  also  be  reported  in  person,  but 

to  guarantee  total  anonymity  when  preferred,  we  work  with  a  third-party  web 

application  to  allow  stakeholders  to  register  any  suspected  misconduct  in  good 

faith to ensure whistleblowing protection in line with our Whistleblowing Policy. 

Our  intranet  page  ensures  availability  and  awareness  of  this  platform  for  our 

employees and the whistleblowing system can also be accessed via our website by 

external stakeholders. This whistleblowing process is key to the effectiveness of the 

compliance framework. Should a report be submitted through our whistleblowing 

platform,  an  investigation  is  launched  by  a  responsible  user  of  the  system,  or  a 

member of Group Compliance to ensure objectivity of the investigation.

Additionally, the intranet platform provides links to our Contemporary Real Estate

Academy (CREA), our e-learning tool providing training on anti-corruption, bribery, 

managers.  Furthermore,  our  Employee  Code  of  Conduct  establishes  expectations 

and data protection topics. This continual training and communication ensure that 

for  all  staff  to  abide  by  the  values  of  openness,  trust,  teamwork,  and  acceptance 

understanding of our standards is always being reinforced. Compliance trainings 

of diversity in all their dealings with one another and with our tenants and other 

through  CREA  are  included  in  our Welcome  Days  for  new  employees,  as  well  as 

stakeholders. Adherence to the Code of Conduct is a mandatory requirement of all 

training on the use of our whistleblowing platform. Furthermore, employees are 

employee contracts.

Our Intranet Compliance Site

Since  2022,  we  have  a  compliance  site  on  our  Group  intranet,  where  the  above 

policies  are  available  to  all  our  employees.  This  is  a  major  step  towards  our 

overarching goal of unifying our internal policies across all our operating regions. 

Through the intranet platform, we can now also ensure that policies are available 

in a standard form to the whole organization, and that updates to these policies 

are rolled out immediately.

required to undergo annual refresher training on these policies, to reaffirm their 

commitment to these standards.

Compliance Monitoring

In addition to unifying our compliance approach across our operating locations, we 

want awareness and consideration of compliance issues to be straightforward and 

commonplace for our employees. To this end, in 2022 we introduced compliance 

ambassadors  in  our  regional  offices,  to  serve  as  first  contact  points  for  staff  on 

compliance subjects. These have currently been embedded in our UK and Cyprus 

Our intranet page and our publicly available website also support the measures

our employees view our company, and if, and how, we need to make improvements. 

We monitor the effectiveness of our compliance framework by tracking the number 

of compliance violations. We continue to carefully analyze the evolving market and 

regulatory  environment  in  conjunction  with  further  appropriate  development  of 

internal structures. This process considers a range of compliance issues including 

but not limited to corruption or bribery, conflicts of interest, insider trading, and 

money laundering. In 2023, zero relevant compliance cases were reported within 

the Group.

For  the  purpose  of  this  report,  Aroundtown  considers  a  compliance  case  to  be 

relevant  either  when  it  has  the  potential  to  materially  harm  the  reputation  of 

Aroundtown, will have a significant impact on an investor’s decision to invest in AT 

or if it may lead to a significant financial damage (of > €500 thousand). Any cases 

The  feedback  we  received  during  this  exercise  is  reflective  of  our  employee 

engagement programs and demonstrates the values we uphold at the Aroundtown

During 2023, we were not subject to any convictions or fines resulting from the 

violation of anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws. We also did not experience any 

incidents of corruption or bribery, or any public legal cases in this regard.

of  Conduct  is  a  binding  requirement  for  our  business  partners  with  an  annual 

contractual volume above €5,000, with the exception of large corporations which 

have their own code of conduct – provided it is in line with our standards – and 

with  the  exception  of  organizations  that  operate  in  heavily-regulated  sectors. 

With the signing of our Business Partner Code of Conduct, these business partners 

demonstrate their commitment to adhering to the Code of Conduct.  Furthermore, 

in 2023 we enhanced this process by developing a Business Partner Questionnaire 

which assesses compliance with our Code of Conduct.  

To  fulfill  our  commitment  and  effectively  manage  the  risks  associated  with  our 

business  partners,  we  conduct  regular  onsite  checks,  particularly  focusing  on 

health and safety. Regarding payment terms, although we do not have a specific 

policy in place that addresses cases of late payments to our suppliers, we do define 

the payment terms at the beginning of our contracts to ensure we are on the same 

page with suppliers, and we do adhere to this agreement. 

Taking  into  account  adverse  impacts  on  human  rights  identified  in  the  Group’s 

materiality assessment and risk management process, which involves consideration 

of the risks associated with our suppliers according to their economic sectors and 

countries of operation, Aroundtown has identified and addressed potential risks in 

the areas of construction and refurbishment/maintenance of the business through 

a number of measures and processes. For instance, Aroundtown’s critical suppliers 

(those with a contract volume of > €250 thousand per annum) are required to sign 

the  Group’s  HR  questionnaire  and  during  project  implementation,  site  visits  are 

conducted by the Construction or Operation Departments on a quarterly basis to 

ensure compliance with our ESG Strategy.

DATA PROTECTION

We  have  a  deep  commitment  to  protecting  the  privacy  of  our  stakeholders’ 

 ● Availability: designing systems to minimize downtime

data,  which  goes  beyond  what  is  required  of  us  by  regulation.  We  believe  data 

protection is a key aspect sitting within our governance responsibilities, and every 

organization should have strong data protection governance in place. The volume 

of data handled in our business relationships increases every year, and we take the 

trust placed in us to protect the confidentiality of this data seriously.

Long-term Targets

 ● Identify risks proactively, to detect and eliminate weaknesses before they can 

become threats

 ● Embed a culture of awareness and vigilance throughout our staff, through 

consistent and regular training 

 ● Pursue continual improvement of the security of our digital systems

2024 Goals

 ● Pass our recertification audits for ISO 27001

 ● Introduce a new “on the job” learning format aimed at making information security 
more accessible by e.g., rolling out awareness campaigns across our offices  

The development of our Information Security and Privacy Strategy is continual, and 

is spearheaded by our in-house cybersecurity leads, who sit in on the board’s Risk 

Committee  meetings  to  reflect  data  security  considerations  in  our  top-level  risk 

management processes. Our ISO 27001 certification for our Information Security 

Management  System  (ISMS)  at  our  headquarters  in  Berlin  was  maintained  for  a 

third consecutive year in 2023. The scope of the certification applies to our head 

 ● Security: securing business information pertaining to Group operations

 ● PII: enforcing the security and confidentiality of processed personal information

 ● Regulations: satisfying regulatory (such as GDPR) and other information security 

requirements

 ● Awareness: training employees on how to identify threats and act according to 

Group guidelines

 ● Resilience: protecting our systems and networks as well as the data contained 

therein from malicious activities

 ● Information Assets: ensuring that all networks, systems and applications comply 

with confidentiality, integrity and availability

As  part  of  our  proactive  approach  to  risk  management,  we  have  conducted  28 

internal  reviews  at  our  office  branches  (local  and  international)  over  2022  and 

2023, and further reviews are already planned for 2024. These were designed to 

compare the effectiveness of measures at these offices to the implementation at 

our  operational  HQ,  to  ensure  that  the  application  of  our  procedures  is  unified 

across our business locations. The results demonstrated good levels of compliance 

across  the  organization,  and  opportunities  to  further  improve  practice  at  these 

sites were identified. Our goal is to continue to conduct more audits, so we can 

pinpoint potential weaknesses before they become threats.

In  2023,  as  planned,  we  restarted  our  in-person  welcome  days,  including  data 

protection as a key part of the agenda. We also conducted extensive technical crisis 

office, while the scope of the implementation applies to all local and international 

penetration  tests  alongside  risk  assessments. To  further  strengthen  our  security 

offices  where  all  relevant  policies  and  procedures  apply  in  the  same  way.  For 

posture, an extensive Data Loss Prevention Strategy was kicked-off in 2023, which

In light of the shift in recent years to remote working spurred by the COVID-19 

pandemic, we have introduced new controls to ensure that all external connections 

are secure. Through a Privileged Access Management (PAM) System, we have added 

a  supplementary  security  layer  for  external  IT  service  providers  which  enforces 

MFA (multi-factor-authentication), session recording, least privileges and requires 

approval before each session. For our external business service providers, we have 

implemented a tool which checks the compliance of the operating systems that 

connect to ensure that they are well protected with a recent operating system, a 

malware solution and encryption capabilities. External service providers can only 

connect if all these standards are fulfilled. 

To ensure adequate security in our processes for saving and sharing information, all 

documents are labelled with an information security classification, from Public to 

Restricted, which requires password protection for the document, where applicable. 

To embed our data protection system across the Group, we place great importance 

on training and awareness for our staff, with all personnel being required to sign 

a  company  statement  of  their  commitment  to  data  protection.  Furthermore,  all 

our  employees  are  required  to  complete  video-based  training  modules  on  data 

protection, which are regularly developed to keep the training provided up to date. 

In 2022, we developed and filmed new awareness videos starring our employees 

to  make  the  training  more  relatable  and  understandable,  and  we  implemented 

a  photo-based  project  portraying  colleagues  in  fun  poses  edited  to  be  used  as 

“landing pages” for phishing campaigns. In 2024, we intend to continue creating 

highly personalized awareness campaigns covering further topics. 

Beyond initial training on our data protection procedures, we emphasize continued 

learning  and  awareness  efforts.  Furthermore,  Aroundtown’s  Standard  Operating 

Procedures (SOPs) set out expected courses of action for day-to-day activities, such as 

saving and storing information or handling requests for data. Permanent employees 

must  complete  mandatory  refresher  training  every  18  months  to  reinforce  their 

knowledge of these procedures and awareness of data protection risks.

Furthermore, we monitor potential security incidents and data protection breaches 

as  an  indicator  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  operational  procedures.  In  2023,  no 

such confirmed breaches or incidents were reported. In the event of any confirmed 

incident,  a  response  team  is  formed  to  immediately  investigate  the  matter  and 

recommend remedial actions to prevent a similar occurrence.

EPRA sBPR Data Preparation

As members of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA), we choose to 
report on our ESG impacts in accordance with the 3rd edition (2017) of the EPRA 
Sustainability Best Practice Recommendations (sBPR). In 2023, we received the EPRA 
sBPR  Gold  award  for  our  disclosure  for  the  seventh  time  consecutively. This year, 
in  preparation  for  the  first  compliance  window  of  the  CSRD,  we  have  reported  in 
alignment where possible with ESRS disclosure requirements according to our DMA.

Organizational Boundaries

The  information  and  data  in  this  report  covers  the  operations  of  Aroundtown 
SA,  spanning  our  direct  employees  and  commercial  portfolio. As  of  31  December 
2023,  our  Group  portfolio  (including  Grand  City  Properties  S.A.)  held  €25  billion 
of  investment  property  comprising  offices  (40%);  residential  (33%);  hotels  (21%); 
logistics/other and retail (6%). 

Information on our residential portfolio, which is owned by Grand City Properties S.A. 
(“GCP”) in which we hold a 63% stake (excluding the shares GCP holds in treasury), 
has been consolidated and the data is included in the scope of this report. However, 
GCP’s’ performance is also reported separately, and this information is published on 
the sustainability section of GCP’s website.

Landlord and Tenant Boundaries

We have followed the methodology followed in last year’s report for allocating 
energy  consumption  between  landlord-controlled  areas  and  tenant-controlled 
areas. In our 2019 baseline, we use a common area/total area ratio to apportion 
shared-service  heating  consumption  between  landlord  and  tenant  spaces, 
based on the floor area distribution found with the property types classification 
appendix  (3a)  of  the  GRESB  Real  Estate  Assessment  reference  guide12.  Thus, 
the  whole  building  consumption  is  attributed  to  landlord  or  tenant  control  in 
proportion to the ratio of shared spaces to tenant areas expected for the property. 
Correspondingly, emissions from this heating are attributed to Scope 1 and 2 or 
to Scope 3 in the same proportion. For electricity, the consumption for tenant-
controlled  areas  is  estimated  based  on  industry  standard  energy  benchmarks, 

namely those of CIBSE. At present, we collect and/or estimate Scope 3 emissions 
data relating to tenant energy consumption. We look to expand this emissions 
data boundary in future years.

Therefore, the energy consumption and the corresponding CO2 emissions will now 
represent  the  entire  building  area  i.e.,  of  both  landlord  and  tenant-controlled 
area. We recognize that under an operational control approach, the allocation of 
CO2 emissions between Scope 1 or 2 and Scope 3 is dependent on the metering 
and sub-metering arrangement in place between tenants and landlords. However, 
to  create  an  accurate  representation  of  the  entire  building,  we  have  classified 
indirect  emissions  by  area  apportioned  between  landlord  and  tenant  spaces,  as 
described in the methods above.

Coverage

Absolute and like-for-like portfolio environmental data relates to the assets in the 
operational  control  portfolio,  which  is  a  subset  of  the  Organizational  Boundaries 
discussed above, defined as assets the company directly manages building operations 
such as choice of energy provider. The like-for-like subset contains all the properties 
for  which  we  received  environmental  reporting  data  for  the  full  two-year  period 
from January 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2023.

Actual environmental performance data is only reported on assets for which we have 
operational control and for which we can collect utilities data. On an absolute basis, 
this included a net lettable area of 6,337,823 m² out of a total operational control 
portfolio covering a net lettable area of 7,265,365 m² (excluding assets held for sale 
and properties under development) at the end of December 31st, 2023. A breakdown of 
the portfolio net lettable area based on asset types are as follows: office – 2,770,258 
m²,  retail –  183,760  m²,  others  including  logistics –  686,791  m².  During  2023,  we 
continued to improve the quality of our environmental data collection and are now 
able to report like-for-like data from approximately 68% of our total managed assets 
portfolio.

Further information relating to maximum coverage on an absolute and like-for-like 
basis per utility type is provided within our data tables.

Data relating to our employees covers all direct employees employed by Aroundtown 
in  Germany  (who  represent  80%  of  our  European  workforce),  including  part  time 
and  temporary  workers,  as  well  as  our  international  employees.  Following  the 
consolidation  with  GCP  in  2021,  our  employee  data  also  includes  GCP  data,  but 
excludes contractors and those not directly employed by us.

Voluntary  green  building  certifications  (Cert-Tot)  are  discussed  in  absolute  terms. 
100% of the Dutch office portfolio is certified, 36% of the total office portfolio is 
certified  and  21%  of  the  commercial  portfolio  is  certified  with  BREEAM.  In  our 
German portfolio, with the first office assets certified, we expect gradual progress in 
the coming periods. We are also analyzing certification options in our hotel portfolio.

Reporting Period

All  data  relates  to  our  financial year,  which  coincides  with  the  calendar year,  and 
consequently runs from January 1st to December 31st of the year under review.

Estimation of Landlord-Obtained Utility Consumption

1.   Measured  data  for  the  reporting  year  were  not  fully  available  in  time  for 
publication. In instances where the available heating data is not representative, 
estimations were calculated based on known consumption from other periods, 
following  the  ratio-based  heating-degree-days  normalization  method.  In  the 
case  of  electricity,  the  consumption  was  extrapolated  based  on  the  weighted 
arithmetic mean of other known periods. In some instances, this was not possible 
for  heating.  Here  we  calculated  an  estimation  by  extrapolating  expected 
heating consumption according to the EPC rating of the building and weather 
normalization was not performed.

2.   Data is only available for a proportion of units under our management control, 
for example regarding recycled waste. In this instance we have extrapolated data 
for the units where we are able to collect complete data given the similarities 
between our units and those which are tenanted.

We have reported the percentage of estimation that this represents per utility type 
in our data tables.

Furthermore,  we  have  disclosed  the  proportion  of  overall  consumption  that  our 
estimation  of  tenant  consumption  represents,  according  to  our  methodology 
described in the section ‘Landlord and Tenant Boundaries’.

Regarding  only  landlord-obtained  utility  consumption,  as  per  the  EPRA  sBPR 
requirements, we have detailed the extent of estimations below:

 ● Electricity: 76% of landlord-obtained consumption is based on available utility 

consumption data, with 24% estimated. 

 ● Heating: 92% of landlord-obtained consumption is based on available utility 

consumption data, with the remaining 8% estimated.

The total volume of waste is based on the contracted waste volumes at properties 
where this information was available. No additional estimation occurred. The total 
proportion  of  recycled  waste  is  based  on  household  averages  published  by  the 
German environmental protection authority which represents the highest authority 
in the country.

Our own office utilities consumption is estimated based on the proportion of the 
total  rental  floor  area  occupied  by  Aroundtown  as  we  do  not  occupy  the  whole 
building and no sub-meters exist.

Units of Measurement and Normalization

Utilities  data  are  reported  based  on  absolute  consumption  measured  in  kWh 
(energy), t CO2e (GHG emissions), m3 (water) and m3 and tons (waste).

GHG emissions are reported using location-based conversion factors published by 
the German Environmental Protection Association.

Where consumption is normalized, we calculate intensity indicators using floor area 
(m2) for whole buildings, including tenant areas. Since we are now estimating the 
tenant  consumption,  we  believe  that  our  numerator  and  denominator  provide  a 
representative intensity figure.

Employee coverage rates are expressed as a percentage of AT’s total direct employees 
at year end.

 ● Accident/Injury Rate = Number of reportable injuries / Total hours worked 

 ● Lost-Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) = Number of injuries / Million hours worked

 ● Lost Day Rate = Number of days lost due to workplace injuries / Number of 

working hours 

 ● Absentee Rate = Number of days absent due to illness / Total number of working days

 ● Work-related Fatalities = Total number of work-related fatalities

 ● Number of Accidents = Number of Injuries

 ● Rate of Accidents = Injury rate
