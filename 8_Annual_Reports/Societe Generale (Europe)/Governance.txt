The Board of Directors reviewed the Bank’s purpose in 2019 following
the  introduction  of  French  Act  No. 2019-486  on  22 May  2019,  referred
to  as  the  Pacte  Law,  the  aim  of  which  is  to  provide  action  plans  for
innovation,  business  growth  and  transformation.  The  Board  defined
the  new  purpose  as  “Building  together,  with  our  clients,  a  better  and
sustainable  future  through  responsible  and 
innovative  financial
solutions”. From a formal standpoint, the Board decided not to include
the  purpose  in  the  By-laws.  However,  at  its  Extraordinary  General

Meeting of 2020, Societe Generale modified its By-laws to specify that
the Board of Directors determines the strategic focus of the Company’s
activity and ensures that it is implemented according to its corporate
interests,  by 
into  account  environmental  and  social
responsibility  considerations  (see  Chapter 5).  In  May 2021,  the  first
sentence of the preamble of the Board of Directors’ internal rules was
also modified to take account of this change.

On  15 January  2015,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  that, 
accordance with Article L. 511-58 of the French Monetary and Financial
Code  (Code  monétaire  et  financier),  the  offices  of  Chairman  and  Chief
Executive Officer would be separated following the General Meeting of
19 May  2015.  At  that  date,  Lorenzo  Bini  Smaghi  became  Chairman  of
the  Board  of  Directors,  and  Frédéric  Oudéa  remained  Chief  Executive
Officer.  On  21 May  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  renew  the
term of office of Frédéric Oudéa as Chief Executive Officer for a further
four-year term after his term of office as Director was renewed at the
General Meeting of 21 May 2019.

Lorenzo  Bini  Smaghi  was  reappointed  Chairman  of  the  Board  of
Directors on 17 May 2022.

In accordance with legislation and the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the three Directors representing the employees are excluded from the calculation.
Taking into account the dual citizenship of certain Directors.

At  1 January  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  comprised  15  members:  13
Directors  appointed  at  the  General  Meeting  (including  the  Director
representing  the  employee  shareholders  appointed  at  the  General
Meeting  following  the  submission  of  the  employee  shareholders)  and
two Directors representing the employees. 

The  Board  of  Directors  appointed  Jean-Bernard  Lévy  as  non-voting
Director  for  a  two-year  term  from  18  May  2021.  One  of  his  tasks  is  to
assist the Board of Directors in relation to its energy transition remit.
The  Board  decided  to  renew  his  term  for  a  further  two  years  until
18 May 2025 and extend his remit to include the full scope of Corporate
Social  Responsibility  topics  (for  details  of  Jean-Bernard  Lévy’s
responsibilities,  see  page 93  and  for  the  report  on  his  brief,  see
page 104).

A  representative  of  the  Social  and  Economic  Committee  attends  the
Board of Directors’ meetings, but does have voting rights.

The term of office of Directors appointed by the General Meeting is four
years.  Their  tenures  expire  at  staggered  intervals.  Directors  directly
elected  by  the  employees  are  tenured  for  three  years.  At  the  General
Meeting  of  23 May  2023,  a  submission  will  be  made  to  introduce  a
statutory  modification  to  the  length  of  their  tenures,  aligning  them
with  the  four-year  term  of  the  other  Directors.  This  modification  will
take effect from the General Meeting which will approve the financial
statements  of  2023.  The  purpose  of  the  change  is  to  simplify  the
management  of  elections  and  ensure  that  appointments  within  the
Board of Directors are staged at more appropriate intervals.

In  2023,  the  terms  of  office  of  three  Directors  will  expire  and  the
Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee has recommended
to the Board of Directors that they be replaced. In addition, Juan Maria
Nin Génova, whose second term of office will expire in 2024, wishes to
end his tenure at the General Meeting of 23 May 2023.

Frédéric Oudéa will have been Director for 14 years at the date of the
General Meeting of 23 May 2023 - the year of his first appointment was
2009  -  and  his  term  of  office  as  Director  expires  on  this  date.  He
announced  at  the  General  Meeting  of  17 May  2022  that  he  would  not
seek a further term of office as Director or Chief Executive Officer. The
Board of Directors acknowledged his decision and renewed their trust
in him to lead the Group until his term of office expires.

The  Board  of  Directors,  acting  on  the  recommendation  of  the
Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  has  appointed
Slawomir Krupa as Director to replace Frédéric Oudéa.

Slawomir Krupa was born on 18 June 1974 and holds dual French and
Polish citizenship. He has over 27 years’ experience in the international
financial  sector.  He  joined  the  Societe  Generale  Group  in  1996  and
began  his  career  as  an  inspector  in  the  General  Inspection  Division.
From  2007,  when  he  joined  the  Corporate  and  Investment  Banking
Division, he was successively responsible for various functions. In 2007,
he was Director of Strategy and Development, after which he became
Head of Central and Eastern Europe, Middle-East and Africa (CEEMEA)
in 2009. Later, in 2012, he was appointed Deputy Director of Financing.
He  was  appointed  CEO  of  SG  Americas 
In
January 2021,  he  joined  the  Group’s  Executive  Management  team  as
Head of Global Banking and Investor Solutions. He has a Directorship
in Societe General Forge, an unlisted French company of the Group.

in  January 2016. 

Once  elected,  Slawomir  Krupa  will  be  appointed  Chief  Executive
Officer by the Board of Directors. The functions of Chairman and Chief
Executive  Officer  will  continue  to  be  separated  pursuant  to
Article L. 511-58 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.

The  selection  process  for  a  candidate  to  replace  Frédéric  Oudéa  was
launched  in  May 2022.  The  process  was  managed  by  the  Chairman  of
the  Board  of  Directors,  Lorenzo  Bini  Smaghi,  in  conjunction  with  the
Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee, chaired by Gérard
Mestrallet, and involving all the independent Directors and consulting

the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Chairman  was  also  briefed  by  an
independent  consultancy  firm.  He  reviewed  the  panel  of  high-calibre
candidates, both women and men – French and foreign – from inside
and  outside  the  Group.  At  the  end  of  the  selection  process  and  after
the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee had issued its
recommendation, the Board of Directors chose Slawomir Krupa at its
meeting on 30 September 2022.

Kyra Hazou will have been Director for twelve years at the date of the
General Meeting of 23 May 2023. The year of her first appointment was
2011.  In  accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code’s  independence
criteria, Kyra Hazou does not wish to renew her term of office.

The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nomination and
Corporate  Governance  Committee,  has  put  forward  Ulrika  Ekman  as
independent  Director  for  a  four-year  period  to  replace  Kyra  Hazou.  A
Swedish  and  US  citizen,  Ulrika  Ekman  is  60  and  will  bring  extensive
legal experience to the Board. She was previously a partner of the US
law  firm  Davis  Polk  &  Wardnell LLP  (1990-2004).  She  subsequently
performed various functions at Greenhill & Co, a US investment bank,
serving as General Counsel from 2004 to 2012 before founding Embla
Advisors.  She  is  currently  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of
Greenhill & Co.

The  replacement  procedure  involved  a  search  for  candidates  that
began in the summer of 2021 with the assistance of a consultancy firm
based  on  the  criterion  defined  by  the  Nomination  and  Corporate
Governance Committee, i.e., that it was seeking a non-French lawyer or
Chief Legal Officer of a leading international law firm or of a very large
international company, with experience in the US.

Gérard  Mestrallet,  who  chairs  the  Nomination  and  Corporate
Governance  Committee  and  is  a  member  of  the  Compensation
Committee,  has  been  an  independent  Director  for  eight  years  at  the
date  of  the  General  Meeting  of  23 May  2023.  The  year  of  his  first
appointment was 2015 and his term of office as Director will expire on
this date. Gérard Mestrallet, who is 73, does not wish to renew his term
of office.

The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nomination and
Corporate Governance Committee, has put forward Benoît de Ruffray
as  independent  Director  for  a  four-year  period  to  replace  Gérard
Mestrallet.  Benoît  de  Ruffray,  a  French  citizen,  is  56  and  will  bring  to
the  Board  of  Directors  extensive 
industrial
experience.  He  has  been  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Eiffage  since
January 2016. Prior to that, he was CEO of Soletranche Freyssinet after
holding  numerous  positions  in  the  Bouygues  Group  in  France  and
abroad.

The  selection  process  for  a  candidate  to  replace  Gérard  Mestrallet
began  late  in  2021  with  the  assistance  of  a  consultancy  firm  and
guided  by  the  criterion  defined  by  the  Nomination  and  Corporate
Governance Committee, i.e. the successful candidate would need to be

a  manager  of  a  very  large  French  or  European  company  with  an
international 
in  a  sector  sensitive  to
environmental concerns.

It  is  also  proposed  that  a  replacement  be  found  for  Juan  Maria  Nin
Génova, who wishes to bring his term of office to an end a year early.
He  will  have  been  Director  for  seven  years  at  the  date  of  the  General
Meeting  of  23 May  2023  and  his  term  of  office  as  Director  expires  in
2024.  The  year  of  his  first  appointment  was  2016.  In  light  of  his
appointment as Chairman of the Spanish company ITP Aero, following
the approval of the Spanish Council of Ministers and under the terms
of the agreement signed by the latter with the new shareholder of this
company  to  preserve  Spanish  strategic 
industrial  and  defence
interests, Juan Maria Nin Génova wishes to end his term of office at the
General  Meeting  on  23 May  2023  owing  to  time  constraints  and  in
accordance  with  the  rules  governing  the  possible  number  of
Directorships held by bank Directors.

The Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Corporate
Governance Committee, has put forward Béatrice Cossa-Dumurgier as
independent  Director.  Béatrice  Cossa-Dumurgier  is  48  and  a  French
citizen, and will bring to the Board strong expertise in retail and digital
banking.  She  is  a  independent  Director  on  the  Board  of  Casino  and
Peugeot  Invest.  She  is  currently  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  of
Believe,  prior  to  which  she  was  Chief  Operating  Officer  of  BlablaCar.
From  2004  until  2019,  she  held  various  positions  at  BNP  Paribas,
notably in retail banking.

The  selection  process  for  a  candidate  to  replace  Juan  Maria  Nin
Génova  involved  a  search  that  began  during  the  second  half  of  2022,
with  the  assistance  of  a  consultancy  firm  based  on  the  criterion
defined by the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee, i.e.,
a candidate with experience in retail and digital banking.

The  preliminary  short-list  of  candidates  for  each  of  the  Director
positions  had  to  meet  the  “fit  and  proper  person”  criteria  set  by  the
EBA  and  the  ECB.  The  Board  of  Directors  defined  the  profiles  it  was
seeking for each Directorship in light of its composition and made sure
that  they  would  bring  to  it  the  necessary  expertise  to  carry  out  its
remit.

The  Board  of  Directors  verified  that  the  short-listed  candidates  to  be
put  forward  as  Directors  at  the  General  Meeting  of  23 May  2023  meet
these  conditions  and  that  they  will  have  sufficient  time  at  their
disposal to carry out their duties. It also made sure that the resulting
composition  would  strike  the  correct  balance  in  terms  of  gender  and
international  experience.  All  candidates  short-listed  by  the  external
consulting  firm  were  interviewed  by  each  of  the  members  on  the
Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee.

At 1 January 2023, 11 Directors were members of one or several
committees of the Board of Directors.

The composition of the Board of Directors is designed to achieve a
balance between experience, expertise and independence and to
secure gender balance and diversity within its ranks. As such, the
Board of Directors observes the following benchmarks:

p

p

p

compliance with the 40% gender parity rate;

minimum 30% target of non-French Directors on the Board;

skills matrix.

As part of its recruiting process, the Board of Directors arranges the
necessary training programmes and assessments to ensure that
Directors are competent and active, that they attend meetings and are
involved.

The Board ensures that the guidelines laid down by the European
Banking Authority and the European Central Bank regarding fit and
proper person procedures are strictly upheld.

It ensures that its composition is balanced in terms of age as well as
professional and international experience. The Nomination and
Corporate Governance Committee reviews these objectives each year
through an annual assessment, the results of which are set out on
page 104 of the present report on corporate governance. The Board of
Directors also ensures the regular renewal of its members and strictly
applies the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code regarding the
independence of its members.

Expertise  and  experience  in  the  financial  world,  and  leaders  of  large
international  companies  form  the  criteria  underpinning  the  selection
of  the  Directors.  Furthermore,  the  Board  of  Directors  ensures  that  it
has  technological  and  digital  transformation  expertise  among  its
ranks.  Each  year,  the  Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance

Committee  and  the  Board  of  Directors  review  the  existing  balance  in
the  Board  of  Directors’  composition.  A  review  of  the  Directors’
expertise  underscores  the  complementary  nature  of  their  profiles,
particularly  in  relation  to  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  (CSR  –  see
the skills matrix below). Their profiles address the entire spectrum of
the Bank’s businesses and the risks associated with its business.

The matrix below illustrates the Directors’ main areas of expertise and experience. Their biographies can be found on pages 81 to 88.

As of 2024, mobility-related skills will be appraised to make greater allowance for the weight of ALD in the Group’s business.

At  1 January  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  comprised  six  women  and
nine men, i.e. 40% women, or 42% if the two Directors representing the
employees are  excluded from the calculation, in  accordance with the
provisions of Articles L. 225-23 and L. 225-27 of the French Commercial
Code.

The Board of Directors ensures a balanced representation of men and
women among the 13 members appointed by the General Meeting of
Shareholders.

The Board of Directors also makes sure that a balanced representation
of men and women exists on its committees. At 1 January 2023, each
Committee comprised different genders.

The Audit and Internal Control Committee is chaired by a woman.

The  review  concentrated  primarily  on  Gérard  Mestrallet,  who  is
Executive  President  of  Al  Ula,  William  Connelly,  who  chairs  the
Supervisory Board of Aegon N.V. and Amadeus IT Group SA, and Juan
Maria  Nin  Génova,  who  chairs  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Promociones
Habitat,  Itinere  Infraestructuras  de  Mora  Banc  and  ITP  Aero,  and  on
Henri Poupart-Lafarge, who is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Alstom.

In  the  four  cases,  the  Committee  ascertained  that  the  nature  of  the
economic, financial and other relationships between the Directors, the
groups  they  manage  or  chair  and  Societe  Generale  did  not  alter  the
findings of their independence review conducted in early 2022. Societe
Generale’s  role  in  financing  the  debt  of  their  groups  appeared  to  be
compatible with the Committee’s assessment criteria, i.e. less than 5%
of  the  banking  and  non-banking  debt.  They  are  therefore  deemed  to
be independent. 

In  light  of  the  report,  only  four  Directors  are  considered  not  to  be
independent:  Frédéric  Oudéa,  the  Director  representing  employee
shareholders and the two Directors representing the employees.

At 1 January 2023, the number of independent Directors was therefore
11,  i.e.  92%  of  the  Board’s  members,  using  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code’s
calculation  rule  that  excludes  the  two  employee  representatives  and
the employee shareholder representative.

The  percentage  is  well  above  the  Board  of  Directors’  requirement  to
observe 
independent  Directors
target  of  50% 
recommended in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.

the  minimum 

The  Board  of  Directors,  acting  on  the  submission  of  the  Nomination
and Corporate Governance Committee, examined the situation of the
Directors  to  be  put  forward  at  the  General  Meeting  of  23 May  2023
(Slawomir  Krupa,  Béatrice  Cossa-Dumurgier,  Benoît  de  Ruffray  and
Ulrika Ekman). Slawomir Krupa cannot be deemed to be independent.
The  others  meet  the  independence  criteria.  In  its  assessment,  the
Committee  verified  the  business  relationship  with  Eiffage,  of  which
Benoît de Ruffray is Chief Executive Officer.

If  the  General  Meeting  approves  these  propositions  concerning  the
Board of Directors:

p

the  percentage  of  women  on  the  Board  of  Directors  will  be  47%
(seven  out  of  15  Directors)  based  on  the  total  number  of  Board  of
Director  members  or  50%  (six  out  of  12)  if,  in  accordance  with
legislation  and  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the  Director  representing
employee  shareholders  and  the  two  Directors  representing
employees  are  excluded  from  the  calculation;  or  46%  women  (six
out of 13), excluding only the two Directors representing employees;

the  independence  rate  will  be  92%  (11  out  of  12 Directors)  if,  in
accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the  three  employee
Directors are excluded from the calculation; and

eight out of 15 Directors will be foreign nationals, i.e. the percentage
of  non-French  Board  of  Director  members  will  be  53%  if  the
Directors representing employees are included, and eight out of 12,
taking the percentage of international members to 67% if the three
employee Directors were excluded from the calculation.

The Board of Directors has therefore made certain that it possesses all
the  necessary  skills  to  function  properly  and  to  carry  out  its  brief  of
defining the strategy of Societe Generale Group and ensuring that it is
implemented.

At 1 January 2023, the average age of the Directors was 59:

two Directors are less than 50;

six Directors are between 50 and 60;

three Directors are between 60 and 65;

three Directors are between 66 and 70;

one Director is over 70.

This  balanced  breakdown  ensures  that  members  have  both  the
experience and the time available to devote to the Board’s work. The
desired objective is to preserve the balance between the different age
brackets of Board of Director members.

By the next General Meeting, the average length of tenure on the Board
of  Directors  will  be  seven  years.  The  average  duration  should  be
weighed  up  against  the  Directors’  four-year  terms  of  office  and  the
Board  of  Directors’  practice  to  factor  in  the  independence  aspect,  i.e.
to not have been a Director for more than twelve years when renewing
the independent Directors’ terms of office. If the renewal submissions
are  approved  at  the  General  Meeting,  the  average  age  will  decrease
to 55.

Nine different nationalities are represented on the Board of Directors,
which includes two members who hold dual citizenship.

All  Board  members  -  ruling  out  the  Directors  who  are  employees  -
possess international experience, either because they have occupied a
position outside France during their career, or because they have held
one or several Directorships in non-French companies.

The aim of the Board of Directors is to ensure that at least one-third of
its members appointed at the General Meeting are non-French citizens
and, furthermore, to include persons whose nationalities embody the
Group’s European dimension. At 1 January 2023, six out of 12 Directors
were non-French nationals, excluding employee Directors.

In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and based on the report of
its  Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  the  Board  of
Directors  reviewed  the  situation  of  each  of  its  members  at  1 January
2023

aforementioned Code.

It  reviewed  the  status  of  the  business  relationships  existing  between
the Directors or the companies they manage and Societe Generale and
its  subsidiaries.  The  review  concerned  both  customer  and  supplier
relationships.

The  Board  specifically 
focused  on  the  banking  and  advisory
relationships  between  the  Group  and  the  companies  in  which  its
Directors are also executive officers to assess whether the nature and
extent of these relationships could possibly affect the independence of
Directors’  decision-making.  The  assessment 
is  based  on  a
multi-criteria  review  integrating  several  parameters,  such  as  the
Company’s overall debt and liquidity, the ratio of bank debt to overall
debt,  the  amount  of  Societe  Generale’s  commitments  and  the  extent
of  these  commitments  compared  to  total  bank  debt,  advisory
mandates held, and other commercial relationships.

The Director shall inform the Secretary of the Board of Directors by letter or email of any conflict of interest, including potential, in
which he/she may be directly or indirectly involved. He/she shall refrain from participating in any discussion and voting on such
matters.

The Chairman is in charge of managing conflict of interest situations of the members of the Board of Directors. Where appropriate,
he/she refers the matter to the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee. Regarding conflicts that could affect him/her
personally, he/she refers to the Chairman of the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee.

If necessary, the Chairman may invite a Director having a conflict of interest not to attend the deliberation.

The Director shall inform, by letter or email, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Nomination and Corporate
Governance Committee of his/her intention to accept a new corporate office position, including his/her participation in a Committee in
a company not belonging to a group of which he/she is director or officer, in order to enable the Board of Directors, based on the
proposal of the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee, to decide where appropriate that such an appointment would be
inconsistent with the directorship in Societe Generale.

Each Director shall make a sworn statement as to the existence or otherwise of the situations referred to in 5.8 and 8.1: (i) upon taking
up his/her office, (ii) each year in response to the request made by the Secretary of the Board of Directors upon the preparation of the
Universal Registration Document, (iii) at any time if the Secretary of the Board of Directors requests it and (iv) within 10 working days
following the occurrence of any event that renders the previous statement made by him/her in whole or in part inaccurate.

In accordance with article L. 511-53-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, Societe Generale and the entities of the Societe
Generale group keep up to date and at the disposal of the ACPR the appropriate documentation concerning all of the loans granted by
Societe Generale or an entity of the Group to each director and their related parties. In addition to the legal provisions, where
applicable, relating to regulated agreements requiring prior authorisation from the Board of Directors in which the interested party does
not take part, an internal procedure within the Group

(cid:42)(cid:3)

directions for the Group’s activity

The Board of Directors determines the directions of the Group’s activity, ensures their implementation by General Management and reviews
them at least once a year; these directions incorporate the values and the Code of Conduct of the Group, which it approves, as well as the
main thrusts of the policy adopted with respect to social and environmental responsibility, human resources, information systems and
organisation.

(cid:43)(cid:3)

strategic operations

p

approves the plans for strategic operations, in particular acquisitions or disposals, that may have a significant impact on the Group’s
earnings, its balance sheet structure or its risk profile.

This prior approval process concerns:

-

-

-

-

organic growth transactions of a unit amount higher than EUR 250 million and not already approved as part of the annual budget or the
strategic plan,

external growth transactions of a unit amount higher than EUR 500 million or higher than EUR 250 million if these transactions fall outside
the development priorities approved in the strategic plan,

disposal transactions of a unit amount higher than EUR 250 million,

partnership transactions with a compensation (soulte) of an amount higher than EUR 250 million,

transactions substantially degrading the Group’s risk profile.

The Chairman shall assess, on a case-by-case basis, the appropriateness of a referral to the Board of Directors to deliberate on a transaction
that does not fall under the aforementioned circumstances.

During each Board of Directors’ meeting, an update is made on the transactions concluded since the previous meeting, as well as on the main
projects in progress and likely to be concluded before the next Board of Directors’ meeting.

(cid:44)(cid:3)

risk management and control

The Board of Directors:

p

approves the overall strategy and the appetite for risks of any kind(1) and controls the implementation, including outsourced activities. To
this end, it:

which the Group is or could be exposed,

-

-

-

ensures, in particular, the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management systems,

p

p

p

effective and prudent management of the institution, in particular the separation of functions within the organisation of the Company and
the prevention of conflicts of interest;

and terrorist financing. To do so, it determines, where applicable, with the assistance of its Committees, the volume, form and frequency of
the information submitted to it;

(1)
(2)

The typology of risks is mentioned in the Group Risk Appetite Statement.
The legal classification of “Effective Senior Managers” only falls within the scope of the banking regulations under the remit of the ECB and the ACPR. For Societe Generale,
at the date of the last amendment of the Internal Rules, this means the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.

The Internal Rules govern the functioning of the Board of Directors; see
Article 11 of the Internal Rules, page 652. A meeting of the Board of
Directors is convened by the Chairman, by letter, fax, email or any
other means, or at the request of one-third of the Directors. It meets at
least eight times a year, notably to close the annual and consolidated
financial statements.

Each Director receives the information required to carry out their
duties and in particular to prepare each Board meeting. The Directors
are also given useful information, including critical information, on
significant events for the Company. Each Director attends training
sessions to enable them to perform their duties.

In 2022, the Board held 18 meetings, compared with 15 in 2022, the
average length of which was three hours. The average attendance rate
of Directors per meeting was 97%, compared with 96% in 2021. In
addition to these meetings, the Board of Directors also held several
conference calls to discuss matters of concern.

Five executive sessions held in the absence of Chief Executive Officers
also took place, the purpose of which was to assess the General
Management team’s performance, succession plans, in particular the
Chief Executive Officer’s successor, the Company’s organisation,
compensation of chief executives and the strategic focus.

The Board of Directors reviewed the Group’s strategy and its main
businesses, and examined the competitive landscape during a
strategic seminar organised in September and at two Board of
Directors’ meetings.

Further to the work already carried out, the Board of Directors devoted
several agenda items to the merger of the Societe Generale and Crédit
du Nord networks, the tie-up between ALD and LeasePlan that was
announced to the market on 6 January 2022, Boursorama’s strategy
and the Alliance Bernstein joint venture transaction. The Board of
Directors also assessed the situation in Russia on several occasions
before deciding to divest the Group’s Russian activities.

As is the case every year, the Board of Directors closed the annual,
interim and quarterly financial statements, and examined the budget.

During 2022, the Board of Directors continued to monitor the Group’s
liquidity profile and its capital trajectory in light of regulatory
requirements.

It devoted time to several follow-up points on ECB recommendations,
particularly in respect of the SREP. It also performed an exhaustive
review of its Internal Rules.

At its meeting on 12 January 2023, the Board of Directors re-examined the way in which it is organised to handle CSR-relating topics.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), particularly as it relates to climate, it decided at full Board level on the basis of a proposition from
General Management which is reviewed by the non-voting Director. The proposition is previously reviewed by the Risk Committee dealing
with risk aspects, the Compensation Committee dealing with compensation aspects pertaining to the Chief Executive Officers and the
Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee on governance questions (including internal governance of the Group).

The Risk Committee monitors CSR-related risks on a quarterly basis and also reviews the results of all climate stress tests.

The Audit and Internal Control Committee reviews all financial and extra-financial communication documentation relating to CSR, i.e., duty of
care, extra-financial performance) before they are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.

The Compensation Committee submits to the Board of Directors the selected CSR criteria for the remuneration of corporate officers.

The Nomination and Corporate Government Committee prepares the Board of Directors’ deliberations on its optimum organisation to deal
with CSR-related issues, as was the case for its meeting of 12 January 2023. Using the Directors’ skills matrix, it examines the Board’s skills
matrix every year (see page 76) focusing on the Board of Directors’ skills requirements, including how they apply to various CSR-related issues.
It draws the necessary conclusions on the recruitment processes in place and the training on offer. In 2022, training was organised for every
Director.

Each of the topics covered by the Committees is subsequently discussed by the Board of Directors at their meetings.

In addition to his role of defining strategy, the non-voting Director assists all the Board’s committees when they deliberate over CSR-related
issues. On that score, at its meeting on 12 January 2023, the Board of Directors endorsed the principle of extending its remit to cover CSR as a
whole and not only the energy transition.

In addition, the Board of Directors’ Internal Rules provide for files submitted to the Board to contain ESG-related information that must
considered where necessary.

As was the case in 2022, the Board of Directors will submit its CSR strategy and implementation in an item on the agenda at the General
Assembly of shareholders of 23 May 2023.

Last, as part of its brief relative to investors, the Chairman will present the major planks of the CSR policy, in addition to the key points of
Group governance, and will discuss them with investors.

The Board of Directors continues to reinforce its compliance
programme and to ensure that respect for rules and integrity are the
the Group’s corporate culture following the
cornerstones of
permanent dismissal in 2021 of two legal proceedings brought by the
US Department of Justice (“DOJ”). One related to Societe Generale’s
IBOR submissions and certain transactions
involving Libyan
counterparties, and the other
involved US economic sanctions
compliance.

The Board of Directors at its meeting of 14 December 2022 ensured
that the diversity targets they had laid down for governance bodies at
the Board meeting of 4 November 2020 were being implemented. This
diversity policy is described in Chapter 3.1.5, “Diversity Policy within
Societe Generale”.

The Board of Directors was informed of regulatory changes and their
consequences for the Group’s organisation and its business. The Board
of Directors regularly reviewed the Group’s risk status. It approved the
Group’s risk appetite. It approved the ICAAP and the ILAAP, as well as
the Group’s overall market risk limits. Also reviewed were the Annual
Reports on internal control communicated to the French Prudential
Supervisory and Resolution Authority (ACPR), as well as the responses
to follow-up letters following ACPR and ECB inspections.

It also assessed the performances of the Chief and Deputy Chief
Executive Officers and determined their compensation, as well as that
of the Chairman. It established performance share plans.

The members also discussed the policy in place with respect to gender
equality in the workplace and equal pay.

Last, the Board decided on the allocation of compensation to Directors
(see page 146) and the non-voting Director.

The Board of Directors prepared and approved the resolutions to be
submitted to the Annual General Meeting and, in particular, those
relating to the reappointment of Directors whose terms are due to
expire.

Each year, the Board of Directors reviews its own functioning process
by way of an assessment. The assessment is carried out every three
years by an external consulting firm and, for the other years, is based
on interviews and surveys conducted by the Nomination and
Corporate Governance Committee. This year the assessment was
carried out by an external
firm, as was the case in 2019. The
conclusions of the 2022 review are set out in the assessment section of
this report (see page 104).

Similarly, and as is the case every year, the Board of Directors
discussed the succession plans for General Management. These
succession plans distinguish between successions occurring at the end
of the terms of office and unexpected successions, and are prepared
by the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee.

Meeting on 7 February 2023, the Board of Directors approved the
propositions presented by the Compensation Committee regarding
the Chief Executive Officers’ quantitative and qualitative targets.
Overall, the general principles governing the global compensation
structure have not changed (see Chapter 3.1.6).

In 2022, the working method employed by the Board in 2020 was
improved by systematically calling on one of the Directors to table
strategic or cross-business discussions after a presentation from
General Management, where necessary. This process enhanced the
substantive nature of the work performed and gives added weight to
each individual Director’s involvement. Since 18 May 2021 the Board of
Directors has also had the benefit of Jean-Bernard Lévy’s insight in his
capacity as non-voting Director appointed for a two-year term. One of
his tasks is to assist the Board of Directors in relation to its energy
transition remit.

The Board of Directors observed that no new agreement had been
signed during the year ended 31 December 2022, directly or by any
other intermediary, between any of the corporate officers or any of the
shareholders holding a fraction of voting rights exceeding 10% of a
company, or another company controlled by the former in accordance
with Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code. Excluded from
this assessment were agreements on ordinary operations and
concluded under normal conditions.

Calculation excluding Directors representing employees, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code.

Each  Committee  comprises  at  least  four  members.  None  of  the
Directors is a member of more than two Committees. Each Committee
comprises at least one member of either sex.

One  Director  representing  the  employees  sits  on  the  Compensation
Committee.  One  Director  sits  on  both  the  Risk  Committee  and  the
Compensation Committee.

Since  2018,  the  Risk  Committee  has  been  extended  to  include  the
members of the Audit and Internal Control Committee when it sits as
the  US  Risk  Committee.  The  following  Directors  sit  on  the  Risk
Committee:  William  Connelly  (Chairman),  Diane  Côté,  Kyra  Hazou,
Annette  Messemer,  Alexandra  Schaapveld,  Jérôme  Contamine  and
Juan Maria Nin Génova.

The  Chairpersons  of  the  Risk  Committee  and  the  Audit  and  Internal
Control Committee meet with the ECB and the US Federal Reserve at
least once a year to provide an overview of the Committees’ activities.

The US Risk Committee met in New York in December 2021 and again
in January 2023.

The duties of the Board of Directors’ four Committees are set out in the
corresponding charters which comprise the appendices of the Internal
Rules (see Chapter 7).

Without prejudice to the detailed list of missions referred to in article 5, the Audit and Internal Control Committee’s mission is to monitor
issues concerning the preparation and control of accounting, financial and non-financial information, as well as the monitoring of the
effectiveness of internal control, measurement, monitoring and risk control systems. It conducts the procedure for selecting the Statutory
Auditors. It approves the services provided by the Statutory Auditors other than the certification of the financial statements.

The Audit and Internal Control Committee is comprised of at least four Directors, appointed by the Board of Directors, who have appropriate
financial, accounting, statutory audit or non-financial expertise. At least two thirds of the Committee’s members are independent within the
meaning of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code.

The heads of the control functions (risk, compliance, audit), the CFO and the Secretary General are present at all meetings, unless otherwise
decided by the Chairman of the Committee.

The Statutory Auditors shall be invited to the meetings of the Audit and Internal Control Committee, unless the Committee decides otherwise.
They may also be consulted outside meetings and without the presence of Executive Officers and any employee of the Company.

When the Committee reviews the financial statements, this is preceded by a meeting with the Statutory Auditors, without the presence of the
Executive Officers and any employee of the Company.

The Executive Officer in charge of supervising internal control is present at the Committee’s Meetings when it examines the report on internal
control.

The Executive Officers may also, from time to time, assist the work of the Committee at its request.

The Committee held six meetings acting in its capacity as the US Risk
Committee. It validated the Group’s risk appetite with respect to US
operations. It also performed other tasks required under US law such
as the supervision of liquidity risk and the approval of risk strategies. It
reviewed the remediation risk management plan requested by the US
Federal Reserve. The Committee received training on business
developments in the US and on regulatory changes impacting the US
Risk Committee’s activity. The US Risk Committee Charter is appended
to the Board of Directors’ Internal Rules (see page 669).

The Committee reviewed the Internal Rules on the topics jointly
covered with the Audit and Internal Control Committee and its
involvement in compensation policies.

The Committee prepared the Chief Executive Officers’ assessment
reports. It submitted recommendations on the annual targets for the
Chief and Deputy Chief Executive Officers.

In accordance with the CRDV Directive and its transposition into
French law, the Compensation Committee ensured that the Group’s
compensation policies comply with regulations and that they are
aligned with the Group’s risk management strategy and shareholder
equity targets.

The Committee reviewed the principles of the compensation policy
applicable in the Group, in particular concerning employees whose
in
activities have a significant impact on the Group’s risk profile,
accordance with new regulations in force. It devoted several meetings
to this issue and to ensuring that the structure submitted for regulated
employees complies with the new rules in force. It notably ensured
that the compensation policy effectively takes into account the risks
generated by the businesses and that employees comply with risk
management policies and professional standards. The Risk Committee
issued an opinion on the matter. One of the members, Juan Maria Nin
Génova, sits on both Committees. The Committee also relied on work
performed by external and internal control bodies. The Chairman of
the Risk Committee and the Heads of the Risk and Compliance
Departments gave presentations to Committee members so they could
fully appreciate the risk and compliance issues. Last, it reviewed the
Annual Report on Compensation. The compensation policy is
described in detail on pages 112 and following.

The Committee submitted the share allocation plans to the Board.

It also reviewed the non-voting Director’s compensation.

The Committee was briefed on work relating to the governance of
subsidiaries.

The Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee met 11 times
in 2022. The members’ attendance rate was 89%, compared with 97%
in 2021.

The Chairman of the Board of Directors took part in every meeting in
2022. The Chief Executive Officer was also invited to attend some of
the Committee meetings.

The Committee devoted most of its work to selecting the future Chief
Executive Officer and the new Directors. It recruited two external
consultancy firms to assist it with this task: one for the Chief Executive
Officer and the other for the Directors. Regarding the selection of the
Chief Executive Officer, the process involved several stages and the
Committee consulted with the non-executive members, after which
the name of one candidate was submitted to the Board of Directors.
Each of the short-listed candidates was interviewed individually by the
Committee members. As far as the recruitment of the new Directors
was concerned, the Committee defined the profiles sought for each
Director position using the skills matrix, it interviewed the short-listed
candidates and recommended one of them to the Board. The selection
process took place over several months during which the Board was
briefed on a regular basis.

Director independence was being complied with. It decided to launch
a request for proposals to recruit Directors in 2024.

It also reviewed the composition of the Committees.

When  preparing  the  succession  plans  for  General  Management,  the
Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  relies  on  work
carried  out  internally  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and,  where
necessary, by external consultants. These succession plans distinguish
between  unexpected  successions  and  successions  prepared  ahead
over the medium and long term.

The  Chairman  of  the  Committee,  liaising  with  the  Chairman  of  the
Board  of  Directors,  managed  the  internal  appraisal  procedure  (see
below) which was implemented by an external consultancy firm.

The  Chairman  of  the  Committee,  together  with  the  Chairman  of  the
Board  of  Directors,  oversaw  the  assessment  procedure  of  the  Board
(see below) that was implemented by an external consultant.

The  Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  prepared  the
conditions of compensation awarded to Directors.

It  prepared  the  Board  of  Directors’  review  of  the  present  report  on
corporate governance.

It  prepared  the  Board  of  Directors’  decision  on  the  Group’s  diversity
targets  within  the  governing  bodies,  which  were  approved  by  the
Board of Directors (see 3.1.5 page 111 below).

In  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  was  assisted  by  a  Non-voting  Director
whose role was to assist it in its energy transition remit.

The  Non-voting  Director  took  an  active  role  in  2022  in  the  Board  of
Directors’  and  the  Risk  Committee’s  deliberations  regarding  CSR  and
the energy transition. He helped prepare the meetings with the CEO. In
January  2023,  he  gave  a  presentation  to  the  Board,  recapping  his
observations on climate transition, the progress made by the Bank in
this respect and the Board of Directors’ role.

Areas for improvement were identified:

p

p

regarding the need for more streamlined agendas following a year in
which  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  committees  met  57 times,
excluding seminars and strategic meetings, non-executive meetings
and US Risk Committee meetings;

better balance in agenda themes is needed to devote more time to
strategy,  notably  for  CSR  and  Human  Resources,  and  less  time  to
purely regulatory issues.

Board  members  greatly  appreciated  their  training  sessions  and
seminars.

Certain themes could be dealt with in further depth:

p

HR;

p

p

p

cyber security;

strategy follow-up;

client satisfaction and commercial policy;

Members  expect  a  more  in-depth  approach  to  CSR  and  climate
transition work by further strengthening:

p

p

the role of the non-voting Director;

the  role  of  the  committees,  particularly  the  Risk  Committee,  the
Audit  and  Internal  Control  Committee  and  the  Compensation
Committee;

p

the review of strategy implementation;

Last, Board of Director members again expressed their appreciation of
presentations by a lead speaker on matters being tabled by the Board.

The Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee submitted the
results  at  the  Board  of  Directors’  meeting  of  12 January  2023.  The
latter  validated  these  results  and  made  decisions  on  strategies  to
address  the  expectations  that  were  expressed,  notably  in  respect  of
the way CSR work is organised (see page 93).

Each  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  devotes  part  of  a  meeting  to
discussing  its  functioning  based  on  an  appraisal  performed  by  a
specialised external consultant every three years. For the other years,
the  appraisal  is  based  on  interviews  and  surveys  conducted  by  the
Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee.

In  both  cases,  the  anonymous  responses  are  summarised  in  a
document that serves as a basis for the Board of Directors’ discussions.

For 2023, the Committee decided to obtain an external appraisal from
Leaders  Trust,  a  consultancy  firm.  The  appraisal  focuses  on  the
collective  functioning  of  the  Board,  as  well  as  on  the  individual
performance of each Director. The appraisal is conducted on the basis
of  a  questionnaire  validated  by  the  Nomination  and  Corporate
Governance  Committee.  For  individual  appraisals,  each  Director  is
invited  to  give  their  opinion  on  the  contribution  of  each  of  the  other
Committee members. The individual appraisal procedure also applies
to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the interaction between
the Chairman and the Directors.

The  appraisal  procedure  took  place  between  June 2022  and
January 2023.

Individual performances were not discussed by the Board of Directors.
The  Chairperson  of  the  Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance
Committee informs each member of their appraisal results.

The results of the appraisal were very positive, namely:

p

p

the participation of the Board in strategic analysis and its knowledge
of business lines have improved;

the  Board  of  Directors’  composition  and  governance  were  deemed
to  have  improved  and  its  work  on  finding  a  successor  to  the  Chief
Executive Officer and replacements for Directors were appreciated.

Eleven  training  sessions  were  held  in  2022.  A  customised  training
programme is systematically organised for each incoming Director.

Board of Director members received training on the following matters
in 2022:

p

p

p

p

p

p

p

p

p

p

liquidity, ALM;

in  particular  climate-related 

CSR, 
extra-financial communication;

issues,  biodiversity  and

market risks;

accounting issues;

artificial intelligence;

security;

anti-corruption measures;

anti-money laundering measures;

US financial regulation;

prudential capital.

The programme will be further broadened in 2023 in accordance with
the  findings  of  the  Board  of  Directors’  appraisal  procedure.  Training
sessions  will  continue  to  be  moderated  by  employees,  notably  in
respect of CSR, to ensure their relevance with the company’s situation.

The  annual  seminar  and  certain  themes  developed  during  Board  of
Director meetings also aim to provide additional training, particularly
on the regulatory and competitive environment.

The  annual  amount  allocated  to  attendance  fees  was  set  at
EUR 1,700,000 at the General Meeting of 17 May 2022. The full amount
was used in 2022.

The  rules  governing  the  breakdown  of  compensation  to  Directors  are
determined by Article 18 of the Board’s Internal Rules (see Chapter 7).

Since 2018, the amount of allocated compensation has been reduced
by  EUR 200,000,  to  be  shared  between  the  members  of  the  Risk
Committee  and  the  members  of  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control
Committee  meeting  as  the  US  Risk  Committee  for  US  operations.
Diane  Côté,  member  of  the  Audit  and 
Internal  Controhearsl
Committee,  is  exempt  from  participating  in  the  work  of  the  US  Risk
Committee  and,  accordingly,  does  not  receive  any  corresponding
compensation. This amount is distributed in equal portions, except for
the  Chairman  of  the  Risk  Committee  who  receives  two  portions.  The
balance is then reduced by a lump sum of EUR 130,000 which is divided
between  the  Chairman  of  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control  Committee
and the Chairman of the Risk Committee.

The remaining balance is split between a 50% fixed and 50% variable
portion. The number of fixed portions per Director is six.

Additional fixed portions are allocated to the:

p

Chairman of the Audit and Internal Control Committee or of the Risk
Committee: four portions;

p

p

p

Chairman of the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee
or of the Compensation Committee: three portions;

member  of  the  Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee
or of the Compensation Committee: a half-portion;

member of the Audit and Internal Control Committee or of the Risk
Committee: one portion.

The  fixed  portions  may  be  reduced  in  proportion  to  the  actual
attendance when the attendance over the year falls below 80%.

The variable portion of compensation is divided up and distributed at
the end of the year in proportion to the number of meetings or working
meetings held by the Board of Directors and to each of the Committees
which each Director has attended.

Neither the Chairman of the Board of Directors nor the Chief Executive
Officer receives any compensation as Directors.

Compensation awarded to the non-voting Director falls under another
category and is paid from a separate budget. The rules governing this
type  of  compensation  are  contained  in  Article 21  of  the  Board  of
Directors’  Internal  Rules  (see  Chapter 7).  It  is  equal  to  the  average
remuneration  paid  to  Directors,  with  the  exception  of  compensation
paid to Committee Chairpersons and to Directors who are members of
the  US  Risk  Committee.  This  compensation  takes  account  of  the
person’s attendance rate and is determined following a review by the
Compensation Committee.

in
accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, By-laws, Internal
Rules and guidelines decided by the Board of Directors.

Article 1  of  the  Internal  Rules  (see  Chapter 7,  page 652)  defines  the
cases in which prior approval by the Board of Directors is required; for
example,  in  the  case  of  strategic  investment  projects  exceeding  a
specific amount.

General  Management  submits  the  Diversity  &  Inclusion  policy  to  the
Board  of  Directors  on  an  annual  basis.  The  policy  reflects  Societe
Generale’s determination to recognise the full array of talent within its
ranks and to combat all forms of discrimination involving beliefs, age,
disability,  parenthood  status,  ethnic  origin,  nationality,  gender
identity, sexual orientation, membership of a political, religious, trade
union  or  minority  organisation,  or  any  other  characteristic  that  may
give  rise  to  discrimination.  Over  the  past  few  years  the  Group  has
significantly  strengthened  its  commitments  in  this  regard  by  signing
new  non-discrimination  charters  pertaining  to  men  and  women,  the
LGBT+ community, parenthood, amongst others.

With  regard  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  Societe  Generale  is  committed
to respecting the 40% gender diversity rate. In addition, the Board of
Directors ensures that each Committee includes men and women and
that their chairs are divided between the genders.

At  the  end  of  2020,  the  Group  set  a  gender  equality  target  of  at  least
30%  women  in  management  positions  by 2023,  ensuring  that  both
business units and functions meet the target, as well as implementing
a proactive policy to increase the number of international profiles.

These targets apply at three levels. First, at Group Strategy Committee
level,  which  includes  General  Management  and  the  Heads  of  the
Business  and  Service  Units 
the  Management
Committee  (60  managers  including  the  Strategy  Committee)  and  the
Group’s 162 top executives (referred to as Group Key Persons)(1).

(29 managers), 

At  end-September 2022,  women  held  26%  of  Strategy  Committee
positions, 27% of Management Committee positions and 25% of Group
Key Person positions.

In  December 2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  uphold  the
undertakings  made  by  the  Group  at  end-2023  for  the  Strategy
Committee, the Management Committee and Group Key Persons.

The Board also took note of the 30% minimum requirement for women
in  management  and  senior  management  positions  by  1 March  2026
and,  later,  40%  by  1 March  2029  pursuant  to  the  French  Rixain  Act,

which contains measures aimed at achieving greater equality between
women  and  men  in  companies.  Board  of  Director  members  also
observed that the 30% requirement for women in Senior Management
positions  had  already  been  attained  at  end-2021  and  decided  that  a
new target will be set going forward after 2023, particularly in light of
the new law.

Action  plans  were  rolled  out  in  2021  and  2022  to  meet  the  objectives
laid  down  by  the  Group.  These  will  be  pursued  and  strengthened,
notably by:

p

p

establishing  new  targets  for  job  circles  and  talent  pools  that  are
long-term  sources  of  candidates  for
strategic  medium-  and 
management  bodies.  These  indicators  are  now  managed  using
Objectives and Key Results (OKR) criteria, and are monitored by the
Human Resources Department;

conducting  ongoing  sessions  to  raise  awareness  about  gender  bias
and  stereotyping  to  all  employees  and  which  were  made
compulsory  for  managers  and  future  managers  in  2021.  In  2022,
compulsory  e-learning  modules  were  introduced  in  France  for  HR
teams  and  managers 
in  charge  of  recruiting  and  managing
employees, and will be deployed at international level in 2023.

Every member of the Management Committee is also assessed on their
diversity targets.

Each  year,  General  Management  submits  a  progress  report  to  the
Board  of  Directors  on  the  full  range  of  these  issues  in  France  and
internationally that comprises:

p

p

all diversity and inclusion initiatives rolled out at Group level;

the results achieved at the end of each period. The report contains
the percentages of women and international profiles in key positions
(Strategy  Committee,  Management  Committee  and  Group  Key
Persons),  as  well  as  the  corresponding  diversity  action  plans  in
succession  plans  and  high-potential 
talent  pools.  Where
appropriate, the report also addresses the reasons why the targets
were not met, and the measures being taken to rectify the situation.

The policy governing remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of
Directors and the Chief Executive Officers, presented below, was
approved by the Board of Directors on 8 March 2023 following the
recommendations of the Compensation Committee.

At the General Meeting of 17 May 2022, Frédéric Oudéa announced that
he would not seek to renew his term of office as Director, due to expire
at the General Meeting of 23 May 2023, or as Chief Executive Officer.
The Board of Directors noted this decision and reiterated their
confidence in his leadership until such date. As of 7 February 2023,
Frédéric Oudéa is a Director of ALD Group, a subsidiary of the Societe
Generale Group.

On the advice of
the Nomination and Corporate Governance
Committee, the Board proposed to appoint Slawomir Krupa as
Director for a four-year term to replace Frédéric Oudéa. Once Slawomir
Krupa has been elected, the Board will appoint him Chief Executive
Officer.

The functions of the Chairman and of the Chief Executive Officer will
remain separate in accordance with Article 511-58 of the French
Monetary and Financial Code.

The terms of office of the Deputy Chief Executive Officers will likewise
expire on 23 May 2023. Their renewal will be submitted to the approval
of the Board of Directors of 23 May 2023.

On this subject, and as recommended by the Compensation
Committee, the Board of Directors decided on 8 March 2023 to revise
certain provisions of the remuneration policy adopted by the General
Meeting in 2022, without changing its overall structure.

The adjustments recommended by the Board of Directors are notably
based on an analysis of changing market practices and the
observations expressed by our various stakeholders. These changes
aim to simplify the policy implemented, thus making it easier to
understand.

The main adjustments concern:

clarifying the target annual variable remuneration expected and
increasing the weightings of financial criteria when determining the
annual variable remuneration. Moreover, the financial criteria for
General Management as of 23 May 2023 will be based solely on
Group financial indicators;

changing the Group financial indicators used, with the Core Equity
Tier 1 (CET1) ratio now being used as a threshold criterion to trigger
the financial portion of the annual variable remuneration;

extending the annual variable remuneration deferral period to five
years and the holding period for instrument payments to one year;

p

the scope and term of the non-compete clause applicable to the
Chief Executive Officers appointed as of 23 May 2023.

In accordance with Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce), the remuneration policy detailed below is
subject to the approval of the General Meeting. If it is rejected, the
remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of 17 May 2022
will remain in effect.

The General Meeting must give its approval prior to payment of the
variable components of remuneration (annual variable remuneration
and long-term incentives) or any exceptional components.

By virtue of the second paragraph of Article L. 22-10-8 (III) of the French
Commercial Code, the Board of Directors reserves the right to deviate
from the approved remuneration policy in certain exceptional
circumstances, provided that such action is temporary,
in the
Company’s best interests and necessary to ensure its viability or
long-term survival. The latter could in particular be made necessary by
a major event affecting either the activity of the Group or one of its
areas of activity, or the economic environment of the Bank. The Board
of Directors will decide on the adjustments that should be made to the
remuneration policy in light of any such exceptional circumstances
based on the Compensation Committee’s recommendation and,
where appropriate, the advice of an independent consultancy firm. For
example, the Board could adjust or modify the criteria or conditions
governing the calculation or payment of variable remuneration. Any
such adjustments will be temporary.

The remuneration and employment conditions for
employees are also taken into account as part of the decision-making
process when defining and implementing the policy applicable to the
Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officers.

The Compensation Committee reviews the Company remuneration
policy as well as the remuneration policy for regulated employees (as
defined under banking regulations) on an annual basis.

It monitors the remuneration of the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief
Compliance Officer and the Head of the Inspection and Audit Division.
It receives all information necessary for such purposes, in particular
the Annual Report sent to the European Central Bank. It submits a
policy proposal to the Board of Directors for performance share
awards and prepares the Board’s decisions on the employee savings
plan.

Accordingly, any change in the policy and terms of employee
remuneration is flagged to the Board of Directors which validates the
principles set out therein at the same time as any change in the
remuneration policy governing corporate officers so that it may make
decisions affecting the officers by taking into account
the
remuneration conditions of the Group’s employees.

Lorenzo Bini Smaghi was appointed Chairman of the Board of
Directors on 19 May 2015. His appointment was renewed on 17 May
2022 for the same duration as his term of office as Director (i.e. four
years). He does not have an employment contract.

Frédéric Oudéa was appointed Chief Executive Officer in May 2008,
then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2009, and Chief Executive
Officer again on 19 May 2015. His appointment was renewed on 21 May
2019. He terminated his employment contract when he was appointed
Chairman and CEO in 2009 in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code’s
recommendations regarding corporate officers not holding several
concurrent duties. Frédéric Oudéa’s term of office expires on 23 May
2023. At the General Meeting of 17 May 2022, he announced that he
would not seek to renew his term.

On the basis of work carried out by the Nomination and Corporate
Governance Committee, the Board of Directors recommended the
appointment of Slawomir Krupa as Director and new Chief Executive
Officer to take over from Frédéric Oudéa.

In light of Slawomir Krupa’s seniority in the Bank at the time of his
appointment,
the Board of Directors decided to suspend his
employment contract for the duration of his term of office, considering
that said suspension would not impede the ability to dismiss him as
Chief Executive Officer at any time, and would not lead to concurrent
benefits under his term of office and his suspended employment
contract. The collective bargaining agreement for the French banking
sector governs any termination of employment contracts, and in
particular the requisite notice periods.

Philippe Aymerich and Diony Lebot were appointed Deputy Chief
Executive Officers on 14 May 2018; their appointments were renewed
on 21 May 2019. Their terms of office expire on 23 May 2023. The
employment contracts held by Philippe Aymerich and Diony Lebot
have been suspended for the duration of their terms of office. The
collective bargaining agreement for the French banking sector governs
any termination of employment contracts, and in particular the
requisite notice periods.

The Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officers
are appointed for a term of four years and may be removed from office
at any time.

They are not bound to the Group by any service agreement.

Additional information on the positions of the Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officers can be found in the table on page 153. The
benefits and conditions applicable to the Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officers once they leave the Group are detailed on
pages 121-122.

The purpose of the compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board
of Directors and the Chief Executive Officers is to ensure that the
Company’s top-level positions attract the most promising candidates
and to cultivate motivation and loyalty on a lasting basis, while also
ensuring appropriate compliance and risk management, in accordance
with the principles laid down by the Group’s Code of Conduct.

The policy takes into account all remuneration components as well as
any other benefits granted so as to cover the entirety of the Chief
Executive Officers’ compensation. It ensures an appropriate balance
between these various elements in the general interests of the Group.

Variable remuneration, which is based on certain performance criteria,
is designed to recognise the existence of the Group’s strategy and
promote its sustainability in the interests of shareholders, clients and
staff alike.

Performance is assessed on an annual and multi-annual basis, taking
into account both Societe Generale’s intrinsic performance as well as
its performance compared to the market and its competitors.

In accordance with the pay for performance principle, non-financial
aspects are taken into account in addition to financial performance
criteria when calculating variable remuneration and long-term
incentives; such non-financial aspects include in particular issues of
corporate social responsibility and compliance with the Group’s
leadership model.

Furthermore, the Chairman of the Board’s and Chief Executive Officers’
remuneration complies with:

p

p

the French Commercial Code; and

AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendations.

Lastly, when remuneration is received in the form of shares or share
equivalents, Chief Executive Officers are forbidden from using any
hedging or insurance strategies, whether over the vesting or holding
periods.

term of office. This remuneration remained unchanged when his term
of office as Director and as Chairman was renewed at the General
Meeting of 17 May 2022.

He does not receive remuneration in his capacity as Director.

The remuneration of Chief Executive Officers breaks down into the
following two components:

p

fixed remuneration (FR) rewards experience and responsibility,
taking into account market practices. It accounts for a significant
proportion of overall remuneration and serves as the basis for
calculating annual variable remuneration and long-term incentives;

p

variable remuneration (VR) comprises two components:

annual variable remuneration (AVR) rewards both financial and
non-financial performance over the year; its payment is partially
deferred over time and subject to presence and performance
conditions, and

-

long-term incentives (LTI) aim to align the Chief Executive
Officers’ focus with shareholders’ interests, and to provide the
former with an incentive to deliver long-term performance. Vesting
of LTIs is subject to a condition of continued presence and is based
on the Group’s financial and non-financial performance as
measured against both internal and external criteria.

As recommended by the Compensation Committee, the Board of
Directors on 8 March 2023 decided to adjust the structure of variable
remuneration to improve overall comprehension of the scheme and
ensure a balance between the components awarded:

p

from now on, annual variable remuneration (AVR) will be
determined on the basis of the target annual variable remuneration
representing 120% of annual fixed remuneration for the Chief
Executive Officer and 100% of annual fixed remuneration for the
Deputy Chief Executive Officers; the annual variable remuneration
awarded may not exceed 140% of the fixed remuneration for the
Chief Executive Officer and 116% of the annual fixed remuneration
for the Deputy Chief Executive Officers;

p

the long-term incentives (LTI) awarded (in IFRS value) will be capped
at 100% of annual fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer
and the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.

Pursuant to CRDV, and as approved by the General Meeting in May
2014, the total variable remuneration component (i.e. annual variable
remuneration plus long-term incentives) is capped at 200% of fixed
remuneration(1).

Directors on 8 March 2023 decided to keep the fixed remuneration for
Frédéric Oudéa unchanged for 2023. This remuneration will be paid

Executive Officer will expire.

At the beginning of each year, the Board of Directors defines the
evaluation criteria that will be used to calculate the Chief Executive
Officers’ annual variable remuneration in respect of the financial year.

As recommended by the Compensation Committee, the Board of
Directors on 8 March 2023 decided to update certain terms for
determining and paying annual variable remuneration, in light of the
change in Chief Executive Officer and evolving market practices, and
taking into account the observations made by our stakeholders. These
updates were as follows:

p

p

the target annual variable remuneration is set at 120% of annual
fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and at 100% of
annual fixed remuneration for the Deputy Chief Executive Officers;

the financial portion is increased to 65% of the target annual
variable remuneration (vs 60% of the maximum annual variable
remuneration previously)
to better align it with the Group’s
profitability;

p

p

p

p

financial criteria will be based solely on Group performance for
General Management as of 23 May 2023 (vs 60% for Deputy Chief
Executive Officers previously) in order to assert the primacy of the
Deputy Chief Executive Officers’ collective responsibility at Group
level and the importance of cross-business synergies;

the CET1 ratio will no longer be used as a financial performance
criterion, but as a threshold criterion for the financial portion of
annual variable remuneration;

the target achievement rate of financial targets will equate to
budgetary targets; non-financial criteria may not exceed an overall
achievement rate of more than 100%; financial criteria may be
outperformed by a maximum of 25%, leading to a maximum variable
level of 140% for the Chief Executive Officer and 116% for the Deputy
Chief Executive officers;

payments of the deferred portion of annual variable remuneration
are restructured to extend the vesting period from three to five
years, including three payments in shares or share equivalents with
a one-year holding period (compared with six months previously) to
meet
the regulator’s expectations and comply with market
practices.

Financial criteria: 65%

Non-financial criteria: 35%

Financial criteria based on annual financial performance. Indicators
and target achievement levels are set in advance by the Board of
Directors and are primarily based on the respective budget targets for
the Group and the businesses in each Chief Executive Officer’s remit.

Non-financial criteria based essentially on the achievement of key
targets in relation to the Group’s strategy, and notably the CSR targets,
operational efficiency, risk management and regulatory compliance.

In respect of General Management in place until 23 May 2023, the
financial criteria applicable to the Chief Executive Officer will comprise
exclusively of Group performance-based criteria and for the Deputy
Chief Executive Officers, 60% will be based on Group performance and
40% on remits involving specific responsibilities.

In respect of General Management after 23 May 2023, acting on the
recommendations of the Compensation Committee, the Board of
Directors in its meeting of 8 March 2023 decided that financial criteria
will be based solely on Group performance.

Covering both financial and operational aspects, these indicators are
directly linked to the Group’s strategy and reflect compliance with the
predefined budgets. The Board of Directors excludes from its
calculations any components it deems exceptional.

For reasons of simplification, the Board of Directors decided to change
the rule for setting annual variable remuneration by relying on a target
variable corresponding to 120% of annual fixed remuneration for the
Chief Executive Officer and 100% of annual fixed remuneration for the
Deputy Chief Executive Officers. The achievement rates have been
adjusted accordingly:

The Board of Directors decided to adjust the composition of Group
financial indicators as follows:

p

compliance with the budgetary target equates to an achievement
rate of 100% of the target variable;

p

p

the financial performance measured on the Group's scope will be
based on two indicators: Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE) and the
cost-to-income (C/I) ratio, with equal weighting given to each
indicator, instead of three indicators in the previous policy (ROTE,
C/I ratio and CET1 ratio);

the Core Equity Tier 1 ratio indicator will be used as a variable
financial remuneration threshold. Accordingly , if a minimum level
defined ex ante by the Board of Directors is not achieved, the
achievement rate of each of the financial criteria will be reduced to a
lower threshold, below which it will be deemed zero. If this level is
reached, the achievement rate of each of the financial criteria could
be 100%.

The financial indicators of the specific scope of the Deputy Chief
Executive Officers'
the gross
operating income, Return on Normative Equity (RONE) and the
cost-to-income ratio of the scope of supervision, with equal weighting
given to each indicator.

responsibilities remain unchanged:

p

the budgetary target is still guided by:

-

-

a high point defined ex ante by the Board of Directors and allowing
for an achievement rate of 125%,

a low point defined ex ante by the Board of Directors
corresponding to an achievement rate of 50% and below which the
achievement rate is considered zero.

The achievement rate of each target is defined on a straight-line basis
between these limits.

Each of the financial performance criteria is capped at 125% of its
target weighting. As such, the maximum financial portion is capped at
81.25% of the target annual variable remuneration, with the latter
corresponding to 120% of annual fixed remuneration for the Chief
Executive Officer and 100% for the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.

In respect of financial year 2023, each of the Chief Executive Officers
and Deputy Chief Executive Officers will be paid annual variable
remuneration on a pro rata basis, after determining whether the
abovementioned financial performance conditions were met on an
annual basis.

Each  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  sets  non-financial  targets  for  the
following  financial  year,  as  recommended  by  the  Compensation
Committee.

Given  the  specific  changes  of  this  financial  year,  with  a  new  Chief
Executive  Officer  taking  over  and  possible  changes  to  the  individual
supervisory  remits  of  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officers,  the
non-financial  targets  were  defined  in  accordance  with  this  particular
situation.

During the period from 1 January 2023 to 23 May 2023, 35% of the
annual  variable  remuneration,  including  several  targets  with  a  CSR
component and an equal weighting:

Frédéric Oudéa, Chief Executive Officer:

p

p

ensuring  the  proper  functioning  of  governance  and  a  smooth
managerial transition until 23 May 2023;

helping to secure strategic projects scheduled for completion in H1
2023.

For Philippe Aymerich, Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible for
the  French  and 
international  networks,  Private  Banking  and
Boursorama:

p

p

developing  the  Group’s  priorities  as  a  responsible  employer,
measured  through  compliance  with  commitments  to  promote
women to seats on management bodies and an improved employee
engagement rate (half based on Group indicators, and half based on
individual remits);

positioning in terms of extra-financial ratings;

incorporating  CSR  considerations  into  the  strategy  of  all  Group
businesses  and  implementing  trajectories  compatible  with  the
Group’s commitment to the energy and environmental transition.

Weighted  at  5%,  the  common  targets  of  General  Management  will
concern:

p

p

the quality of the relationships with supervisory bodies;

improving the efficiency of the Corporate Divisions.

Regarding  the  targets  specific  to  the  new  Chief  Executive  Officer,
weighted  at  10%  of  his  annual  variable  remuneration,  they  will
concern the following in 2023:

p

p

implementing and operating the new governance;

continuing  to  carry  out  strategic  projects  and  the  market’s
perception.

Vision 2025: securing the information systems transfers of March and

p

p

for ALD, finalising the acquisition of LeasePlan;

in  terms  of  ESG,  continuing  efforts  to  align  the  portfolio  and  to

During the period from 23 May 2023 to 31 December 23, the Board
of Directors recommends structuring the non-financial criteria of Chief
Executive  Officers  with  an  equal  weighting  of  CSR  criteria  compared
with  2022  (i.e.  20%),  common  targets  for  General  Management  (5%
weighting),  and  specific  targets  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and
Deputy Chief Executive Officers (10% weighting).

The  CSR  targets  will  apply  to  all  Chief  Executive  Officers.  They  are
divided into four themes, all of which include quantifiable targets:

p

improving the customer experience: measured based on the change
in  NPS  for  the  main  activities  (half  based  on  Group  indicators,  and
half based on individual remits);

Attainment  of  the  non-financial  targets  is  assessed  based  on  key
indicators that may be quantified either based on meeting milestones
or  based  on  a  qualitative  evaluation  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  These
indicators  are  defined  in  advance  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  The
achievement rate can be anywhere between 0 and 100%. In the event
of  exceptional  performance, 
rate  of  some
quantifiable  non-financial  targets  can  be  increased  to  120%  by  the
Board  of  Directors,  bearing  in  mind  that  the  overall  non-financial
target achievement rate may not exceed 100%.

the  achievement 

The  maximum  non-financial  portion  is  capped  at  35%  of  the  target
annual  variable  remuneration,  the  latter  corresponding  to  120%  of
annual fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% for
the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officers.  For  2023,  each  of  the  Chief
Executive  Officers  and  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officers  will  be
allocated  annual  variable  remuneration  on  a  pro  rata  temporis  basis
resulting from the application of an annual base amount from the time
the above-mentioned non-financial performance conditions have been
met. 

The  Board  of  Directors  reviews  the  financial  and  non-financial
performance criteria each year.

With a view to strengthening the correlation between remuneration
and the Group’s risk appetite targets and aligning them with
shareholders’ interests, the vesting of at least 60% of the annual
variable remuneration is deferred.

As recommended by the Compensation Committee, the Board of
Directors on 8 March 2023 decided to extend the deferral period from
three to five years. Accordingly, the payment of at least 60% of annual
variable remuneration will be deferred for five years, pro rata. This
concerns both cash payments and awards of shares or share
equivalents
long-term Group
profitability and equity targets; the amounts awarded are reduced if
targets are not met. The Board of Directors reviews the target
achievement rates ahead of the definitive vesting of deferred variable
remuneration. A one-year holding period (instead of six months
previously) will apply after each definitive vesting date of payments in
shares or share equivalents.

to the achievement of

subject

the variable portion granted in shares or share
The value of
equivalents is calculated on the basis of a share price set by the Board
of Directors in March of each year and corresponding to the
trade-weighted average of the twenty trading days prior to the Board
Meeting. The portion of annual variable remuneration granted as share
equivalents entitles the beneficiary to payment of a sum equivalent to
any dividend payments made over the compulsory holding period. No
dividends are paid during the vesting period.

If the Board deems that a decision taken by the Chairman of the Board
of Directors and the Chief Executive Officers has particularly significant
consequences for the Company’s results or image, it may decide not
only to reconsider payment of
the deferred annual variable
remuneration in full or in part (malus clause), but also to recover, for
each award, all or part of the sums already distributed over a six-year
period (clawback clause).

Lastly, the vesting of the deferred annual variable remuneration is also
subject to a condition of presence throughout the Chief Executive
Officer’s current term of office. The only exceptions to this condition
are as follows: retirement, death, disability, incapacity to carry out
duties or removal from office due to a strategic divergence with the
Board of Directors. Once the Chief Executive Officer’s current term of
office comes to an end, this condition of presence no longer applies.
However, if the Board concludes that a decision a Chief Executive
Officer took during their term of office has had particularly significant
consequences for the Company’s results or image, it may decide to
apply either the malus or the clawback clause.

previous year, the Board of Directors decides whether to award any
Societe Generale shares or share equivalents to the Chief Executive
Officers. The fair value of the award upon granting is proportional to
the other components of their remuneration and is set in line with
practices from previous years. Said fair value is based on the share’s
closing price on the day before the Board Meeting. The Board cannot
award Chief Executive Officers long-term incentives when they
leave office.

granting of shares or share equivalents;

definitive vesting subject to a condition of presence throughout the

As recommended by the Compensation Committee, the Board of
Directors on 8 March 2023 decided to introduce the following
adjustments from the award in respect of 2023:

the amount awarded in IFRS value will be capped at 100% of annual
fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy
Chief Executive Officers (vs. 135% for the Chief Executive Officer and
115% for the Deputy Chief Executive Officers currently);

vesting of the long-term incentives will be subject to a new,
additional condition related to profitability, which will be set by the
Board of Directors of February 2024 approving the ex-post policy of
corporate officers. As such, the performance conditions now cover
three areas, each with an equal weighting:

-

-

-

relative performance of the Societe Generale share, as measured
by the increase in total shareholder return (TSR),

CSR performance, and

target related to the Group’s future profitability;

long-term incentives will be awarded in a single instalment (instead
of two instalments previously), with a vesting period of five years
(instead of four and six years), followed by a one-year holding period
after vesting; shares or share equivalents will be granted in this
respect;

definitive vesting will remain subject to a condition of presence
throughout the vesting period, but this condition will be adjusted to
allow officers to retain their unvested long-term incentives on a pro
rata basis in the event that their term of office is not renewed; the
Board of Directors may decide not to allow this retention, depending
on the circumstances of non-renewal.

Chief Executive Officers are awarded long-term incentives consisting of
shares or share equivalents in order to involve them in the Company’s
long-term progress and to align their interests with those of the
shareholders.

In order to comply with the AFEP-MEDEF Code’s recommendations, at
its meeting held each year to approve the financial statements for the

for 33.33% of the LTI award, the relative performance of the Societe
Generale share, as measured by the increase in total shareholder
return (TSR) compared with that for 11 comparable European
banks(1) over the full vesting period. Consequently, the full amount of
shares or share equivalents will only vest if Societe Generale’s TSR
falls in the first quartile of the sample panel. If it falls slightly above
the median value, the vesting rate will be 50% of the total number of
shares or share equivalents granted. No shares or share equivalents
will vest if the TSR performance is below the median value (the
complete vesting chart is shown below);

The panel is selected on the date of the Board of Directors’ meeting at which the award is decided. For example, the panel for the 2022 LTI awarded in 2023 comprised:
Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole SA, Crédit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Intesa, Nordea, Santander, UBS and UniCredit.

The Board of Directors on 8 March 2023 capped the total amount of
long-term incentives awarded in IFRS value at 100% of the annual fixed
remuneration for Chief Executive Officers.

This cap applies in addition to the cap on the definitive vesting value of
shares or payment value of share equivalents. Said value is capped at
an amount corresponding to a multiple of the net asset value per
Societe Generale Group share at 31 December of the year in respect of
which the LTIs were awarded.

In compliance with current regulations, the total variable component
(i.e. annual variable remuneration plus long-term incentives) is in all
events capped at 200% of the fixed component.

On  the  advice  of  the  Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance
Committee and following the recommendations of the Compensation
Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  during  its  meeting  of  12  January
2023  examined  the  implications  of  the  end  of  Chief  Executive  Officer
Frédéric Oudéa’s term of office on 23 May 2023, following his decision
not to seek the renewal of his term, announced at the General Meeting
of 17 May 2022.

The  fixed  remuneration  for  Frédéric  Oudéa  in  respect  of  his  term  as
Chief Executive Officer will be paid until 23 May 2023 (included).

Subject  to  approval  of  the  General  Meeting  of  23  May  2023,  Frédéric
Oudéa will receive annual variable remuneration in respect of 2022 as
decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  7  February  2023,  in  accordance
with the policy approved by the General Meeting of 17 May 2022.

The  annual  variable  remuneration  awarded  for  the  period  from  1
January 2023 to the date of the General Meeting of 23 May 2023 will be
decided by the Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of
the  2023  ex  ante  policy  and  in  line  with  the  usual  performance
evaluation  schedule  for  corporate  officers.  It  will  be  subject  to
shareholders’ approval.

Regarding  the  unvested  deferred  annual  variable  awarded  in  respect
of  2020  and  2021,  the  condition  of  presence  will  no  longer  be
applicable  after  the  end  of  Frédéric  Oudéa’s  term  of  office  as  Chief
Executive Officer in May 2023, in accordance with the policy approved
by the General Meeting, which provides that this condition only applies
until  the  date  of  expiry  of  the  current  term  of  office.  The  other
conditions, in particular the performance conditions and the payment
schedule, will remain in force.

Frédéric  Oudéa  will  not  be  awarded  any  long-term  incentives  in
respect  of  2022  and  2023,  as  no  such  award  may  be  made  when  an
executive  officer  leaves  the  Group,  in  accordance  with  the  policy  and
with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.

Regarding  the  long-term  incentives  awarded  in  respect  of  previous
years  –  considering  that  Frédéric  Oudéa  will  remain  in  the  Group
following  his  appointment  to  the  ALD  Board  of  Directors  (effective  as
from  7  February  2023)  –  the  Board  of  Directors  observed  that  the
condition of presence will be vérified for the duration of his continued
work  in  the  Group  as  Director  of  ALD.  Nonetheless,  considering  the
voting  policies  of  the  company’s  major  shareholders,  the  Board  of
Directors states that for each award, the shares not yet vested will vest
in proportion to the time that has lapsed between the award date and
the  expiry  date  of  Frédéric  Oudéa’s  term  of  office  as  Chief  Executive
Officer, i.e. 23 May 2023. The end of Frédéric Oudéa’s term of office at
ALD would not affect this decision. All the other conditions laid down
in the remuneration policy remain in force.

Frédéric  Oudéa  is  bound  by  a  non-compete  clause  for  a  period  of  six
months  from  the  date  on  which  he  leaves  office  as  Chief  Executive
Officer. The Board of Directors decided that this clause, which provides
that Frédéric Oudéa may not be appointed Chief Executive Officer in a
competing  bank,  should  be  strictly  enforced,  since  Frédéric  Oudéa
does  not  meet  the  conditions  to  retire.  Accordingly,  Frédéric  Oudéa
will receive his fixed monthly salary throughout the application of this
clause.

The  end  of  Frédéric  Oudéa’s  term  of  office  as  Chief  Executive  Officer
will not give rise to any severance pay. Frédéric Oudéa is not entitled to
any supplementary pension benefits from Societe Generale.

benefits was subject to a performance condition.

(cid:17)(cid:32)(cid:44)(cid:49)(cid:37)(cid:45)(cid:44)

Frédéric Oudéa terminated his employment contract by resigning
when he was appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2009.
Accordingly, he is no longer entitled to any supplementary pension

The Company set up a supplementary defined contribution “Article 82”
pension scheme for Management Committee members, including the
Deputy Chief Executive Officers. The scheme took effect on 1 January
2019. The new Chief Executive Officer’s employment contract will be
suspended, and he will remain eligible for this pension scheme, from
which he benefited prior to his appointment.

Under the scheme, the Company pays a yearly contribution into an
individual Article 82 pension account opened in the name of the
fixed
eligible beneficiary, calculated on the portion of
remuneration exceeding four annual French Social Security ceilings.
The accumulated rights will be paid at the earliest on the date on
which the beneficiary draws their French state pension.

The current Deputy Chief Executive Officers and the new Chief
Executive Officer are still entitled to the defined contribution
supplementary pension scheme to which they contributed as
employees prior to becoming Chief Executive Officers.

This defined contribution scheme (the Épargne Retraite Valmy, i.e.
Valmy pension savings scheme) was set up in 1995 in line with Article
83 of the French General Tax Code and amended on 1 January 2018.
The scheme is compulsory for all employees with more than six
months’ seniority in the Company and allows them to save for their
retirement. Upon retirement, their savings are converted into life
annuities. Total contributions correspond to 2.25% of the employee’s
remuneration, capped at four annual French Social Security ceilings, of
which the Company pays 1.75% (i.e. EUR 2,880 based on the 2022
annual French Social Security ceiling). This scheme is insured with
Sogécap.

No further rights were awarded after 31 December 2019.

Until 31 December 2019, Philippe Aymerich and Diony Lebot(1) were
entitled to the senior management supplementary pension scheme
from which they had benefited as employees before being appointed
to their Chief Executive Officer positions.

This supplementary scheme, which was introduced in 1991 and
satisfied the requirements of Article L. 137-11 of the French Social
Security Code, applied to top-level executives appointed after this
date.

revised(2) on 17 January 2019, was
The scheme, which was
permanently closed on 4 July 2019 and no further rights were awarded
after 31 December 2019, pursuant to Order No. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019
in respect of corporate supplementary pension schemes. The Order
prohibited the affiliation of any new beneficiaries to schemes under
which pension rights are conditional upon the beneficiary still working
for the Company when they reach retirement, as well as the award of
such conditional pension rights to any existing beneficiaries for
periods worked after 2019.

The total rights accumulated when existing beneficiaries draw their
pension will therefore consist of the sum of their rights frozen at
31 December 2018 and the minimum rights constituted between
1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019. These rights will be reassessed
according to the change in value of the AGIRC point between
31 December 2019 and the date on which the beneficiary draws their
pension. Such rights are conditional upon the beneficiary still working
at Societe Generale when they reach retirement. They are pre-financed
with an insurance company.

The Chief Executive Officers (Frédéric Oudéa, Philippe Aymerich and
Diony Lebot(3)) have all signed a non-compete clause in favour of
Societe Generale, valid for a period of six months from the date on
which they leave office. The clause prohibits them from accepting a
position at the same level with any listed credit institution in Europe
including the United
(defined as the European Economic Area,
Kingdom) or any credit institution whatsoever in France, whether
listed or unlisted. In exchange, they may continue to receive their gross
fixed monthly salary over said six-month period.

The Board of Directors alone can waive said clause within fifteen days
of the date on which the Chief Executive Officer in question leaves
office. In such a case, no sums will be payable to he Chief Executive
Officer in this respect.

If the departing officer breaches their non-compete clause, they will be
fixed
required to pay forthwith a sum equal
remuneration. Societe Generale will in such circumstances be released
from its obligation to pay any financial consideration and may
furthermore claim back any consideration that may have already been
paid since the breach.

In accordance with Article 25.4 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, no payments
will be made under the non-compete to any Chief Executive Officer
leaving the Company within six months of drawing their pension or
beyond the age of 65.

These clauses remain unchanged and will be enforced until 23 May
2023.

As recommended by the Compensation Committee, the Board of
Directors on 8 March 2023 decided to extend the scope and term of the
non-compete clause applicable to the Chief Executive Officers
appointed as of 23 May 2023.

As is standard practice for financial
institutions, the new Chief
Executive Officers will all sign a non-compete clause in favour of
Societe Generale, valid for a period of twelve months from the date on
which they leave office. This clause prohibits them from accepting a
general management position in or sitting on the executive committee
of a credit institution,
in France or abroad, whose securities are
admitted to trading on a regulated market, or a general management
position in a credit institution in France.
In exchange, they may
continue to receive their gross fixed monthly salary over said
twelve-month period.

The Board of Directors alone can waive said clause within fifteen days
of the date on which the Chief Executive Officer in question leaves
office. In such a case, no sum will be payable to the Chief Executive
Officer in this respect.

If the departing officer breaches their non-compete clause, they will be
required to pay forthwith a sum equal to twelve months’
fixed
remuneration. Societe Generale will in such circumstances be released
from its obligation to pay any financial consideration and may
furthermore claim back any consideration that may have already been
paid since the breach.

In accordance with Article 25.4 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, no payments
will be made under the non-compete to any Chief Executive Officer
leaving the Company within six months of drawing their pension or
beyond the age of 65.

The Chief Executive Officers are entitled to severance pay in respect of
their positions.

The conditions governing their severance pay are as follows:

p

p

p

p

p

severance pay will only be owed in the event of non-voluntary
departure from the Group, confirmed as such by the Board of
Directors. No severance pay will be owed in the event of serious
resignation or non-renewal of a Chief Executive
misconduct,
Officer’s appointment for any reason;

severance pay will be contingent upon an overall achievement rate
for the annual variable remuneration targets of at least an average
of 60% over the three years prior to the Chief Executive Officer
leaving office (or over the duration of their term of office if less than
three years);

the sum paid will represent two years’ fixed remuneration, in line
with the AFEP-MEDEF Code’s recommendation, i.e. two years’ fixed
remuneration plus variable remuneration;

no severance pay will be owed to the Chief Executive Officer or a
Deputy Chief Executive Officer if they leave office within six months
of drawing their French state pension, or if they are entitled to a full
state pension upon their departure (in accordance with Article 26.5.1
of the AFEP-MEDEF Code);

in accordance with Article 26.5.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board
of Directors reviews the Company’s situation and the performance
of each Chief Executive Officer ahead of any decisions on severance
pay, in order to confirm that neither the Company nor the Chief
Executive Officer is failing to perform.

two years’

Under no circumstances may the severance pay and non-compete
clause combined exceed the cap recommended in the AFEP-MEDEF
Code (i.e.
fixed plus annual variable remuneration
including, where applicable, any other severance payments provided
for under an employment contract – in particular any contractual
redundancy pay). This cap is calculated on the basis of the fixed and
annual variable remuneration awarded over the two years preceding
severance.

The Chief Executive Officers each have their own company car, which
is available for private as well as professional use, and insurance
providing the same health and death/disability cover as for employees.

Societe Generale does not generally award exceptional variable
in light of
remuneration to its Chief Executive Officers. However,
legislation requiring prior approval of all aspects of the remuneration
policy, the Board of Directors reserves the right to pay additional
variable remuneration if warranted in certain highly specific situations,
for example, due to the corresponding impact on the Company, or the
level of commitment and challenges involved. Grounds for such
remuneration would need to be given and said remuneration would be
set in accordance with the general principles of the AFEP-MEDEF Code
on remuneration, as well as with the recommendations of the French
Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des marchés financiers – AMF).

It would be paid on the same terms as the annual variable
remuneration, i.e. partially deferred over a period of three years, and
subject to the same vesting conditions.

In compliance with current regulations, the total variable component
(annual variable remuneration,
long-term incentives and any
exceptional variable remuneration) is in any event capped at 200% of
the fixed component.

(cid:17)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:21)

As a rule, the remuneration components and structure described in
this remuneration policy also apply to any new Chairman of the Board
of Directors or Chief Executive Officer appointed whilst said policy
remains in effect, according to their remit and experience. The same
principle will also apply to all other benefits granted to the Chairman
of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officers (e.g.
supplementary pension, health and disability insurance, etc.).

The Board of Directors is therefore responsible for setting the fixed
remuneration of the incoming Chairman of the Board or that of the
Chief Executive Officers in light of these conditions, and in line with the
remuneration awarded to the existing Chairman and Chief Executive
Officers and in accordance with the practices of comparable European
financial institutions.

Lastly, should the incoming Chairman of the Board or Chief Executive
Officer be selected from outside the Societe Generale Group, they may
be awarded a hiring bonus designed to act as compensation for any
remuneration they may have forfeited upon leaving their previous
employer. This bonus would vest on a deferred basis and would be
conditional upon the satisfaction of performance conditions similar to
those applicable to the officers’ deferred variable remuneration.

The total remuneration awarded to Directors is approved by the
General Meeting. Since 2018, the total remuneration awarded to
Directors has been EUR 1,700,000.

The Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer do not
receive any remuneration as Board members.

The rules governing this remuneration and its breakdown between the
Directors are defined under Article 18 of the Internal Rules of the Board
of Directors (see Chapter 7) and detailed on page 105.

At its meeting of 17 May 2022, authorised by the General Meeting, the
Board of Directors defined the evaluation criteria for annual variable
remuneration for 2022, 60% of which is contingent on the achievement
of financial targets, and 40% on the achievement of non-financial
targets.

The individual remits are described in the Governance section, on
page 105.

These targets reflect compliance with the predefined budgets. The
Board of Directors excludes from its calculations any components it
deems exceptional:

p

compliance with the budgetary target equates to an achievement
rate of 80%;

for each performance target, the budgetary target is guided by:

-

-

a high point defined ex ante by the Board of Directors and allowing
for an achievement rate of 100%,

a low point defined ex ante by the Board of Directors
corresponding to an achievement rate of 40% and below which the
achievement rate is considered zero.

The achievement rate of each target is defined on a straight-line basis
between these limits.

The financial criteria for the Group are the return on tangible equity
(ROTE), the Core Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio and the cost-to-income (C/I)
ratio, with an equal weighting for each indicator.

The financial criteria for remits involving specific responsibilities are
gross operating income, Return on Normative Equity (RONE) and the
cost-to-income ratio of each Deputy CEO’s individual supervisory
remit, with an equal weighting for each indicator.

These indicators reflect targets for operational efficiency and risk
for each area, as well as value creation for the
management
shareholders. Covering both financial and operational aspects, these
indicators are directly related to the Group’s strategy and reflect
compliance with the predefined budgets. The Board of Directors
excludes from its calculations any components it deems exceptional.

The financial portion is capped at 60% of the maximum annual
variable remuneration, with the latter corresponding to 135% of
annual fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and 115% for
the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.

The year 2022 was characterised by excellent performance in the
businesses. Up 9.3%, revenues were at an all-time high, driven in
particular by record levels in Financing and Advisory, Financial Market
Activities and ALD, and by strong growth in Private Banking and
International Retail Banking, along with solid performance by French
Retail Banking.

The Group’s underlying cost-to-income ratio saw a strong
improvement (61.0% compared with 64.4% in 2021), excluding the
Single Resolution Fund (SRF) contribution. It was better by more than
600 basis point than budgeted and announcements made to the
market at the beginning of 2022.

Underlying Group net income was EUR 5.6 billion and EUR 2.0 billion
on a reported basis after the impact of the disposal of Rosbank and its
insurance subsidiaries in Russia in Q2 2022. Underlying ROTE stood at
9.6%, i.e. higher than the budgeted ROTE.

The Board of Directors decided to use 6.1% as performance
indicator for the ROTE criterion Group-wide. This rate corresponds
to underlying ROTE, reduced by the impact of the Rosbank disposal
(excluding currency effects related to this disposal). This 6.1% ROTE is
lower than the budgeted ROTE. This decision by the Board of Directors
ensures the remuneration of corporate officers is better aligned with
that of shareholders.

The phased-in CET1 Ratio was 13.5% at the end of 2022, i.e. about 420
basis points above the regulatory requirement and above the CET 1
threshold set at the start of the year for the attribution of the
maximum variable remuneration.

Owing to the strong performance in all the Group’s businesses, as
detailed in the financial communication, the financial indicators were
established well above the budgets set at the start of the year for each
Chief Executive Officer’s specific remit and the upper thresholds for
each of the criteria.

These results are summarised in the table on page 127.

Of the non-financial targets set, 20% are CSR targets shared between
all three Chief Executive Officers, and 20% are specific to their
individual remits. The non-financial portion is capped at 40% of the
maximum annual variable remuneration, the latter corresponding to
135% of annual fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and
115% for the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.

These targets are assessed on the basis of certain key questions
defined in advance by the Board of Directors. The achievement rate
can be anywhere between 0 and 100% of the maximum non-financial
portion. In the event of exceptional performance, the achievement rate
of some quantifiable non-financial targets can be increased to 120% by
the Board of Directors, bearing in mind that the overall non-financial
target achievement rate may not exceed 100%. The respective
weightings for each target are likewise defined in advance.

The non-financial portion is capped at 40% of the maximum annual
variable remuneration, the latter corresponding to 135% of annual
fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and 115% for the
Deputy Chief Executive Officers.

The Board’s assessment of the Chief Executive Officers’ collective CSR targets

The CSR targets are divided into four themes, all of which include quantifiable targets:

Collective targets - CSR

Improving the customer experience: measured based on the change in NPS for the main activities

Developing our priorities as a responsible employer: measured through compliance with our commitments to
promote women to seats on management bodies and an improved employee engagement rate

Having received the Compensation Committee’s recommendations,
the Board of Directors took into account the following achievements
when assessing the non-financial targets.

The Board of Directors observed that the positioning of the main
extra-financial ratings (S&P Global CSA, Sustainalytics and MSCI)
remained aligned with or even surpassed expectations in 2022:

The quality of the customer experience, measured by the change in
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
for the Group’s main activities, has
improved overall with an increase in the majority of measurements.
NPS levels for the Societe Generale and Crédit du Nord networks were
stable despite complex merger preparations. The Board noted the
improved Net Promoter Scores for International Retail Banking and
very high absolute NPS levels for Global Banking and Investor
Solutions, reflecting a sharp increase.

As for the responsible employer target, the Board of Directors
observed that the number of women in senior management is
increasing at a pace consistent with the trajectory regarding the
proportion of women in the Management Committee (27% at end-2022
vs. 25% at end-2021, working towards a target of 30% at end-2023) and
in key Group positions (26% at end-2022 vs. 25% at end-2021, working
towards a target of 30% at end-2023).

The Board of Directors noted a relatively stable employee engagement
rate despite the Group’s robust transformation. The Board of Directors
noted as part of its assessment that the managerial lines have stepped
up their level of engagement, which is now very robust.

the S&P CSA rating, updated in June 2022, was 79/100. The Bank was
ranked among the Top 6% of 242 banks (vs. Top 7% last year);

the Sustainalytics rating for 2022 was 20.1/100, an improvement on
2021. Societe Generale was ranked among the Top 14% of 415
banks;

this year, the Group was ranked in the top 5% of 191 banks, with an
AAA rating for MSCI.

The Board of Directors observed that ESG considerations were better
integrated into the businesses’ strategic roadmaps, which this year
concerned in particular investment banking, bank insurance, private
banking, wealth management, and compliance activities. CSR issues
were also worked into high-stakes acquisitions, such as the
ALD/LeasePlan merger.

The Board of Directors considered that the Group implemented
trajectories compatible with its commitment to the energy and
environmental transition.

The Group committed to raising EUR 250 billion for the energy and

2025. In this respect, the total amount raised through sustainable bond
issues and transactions devoted to the renewable energies sector was

reducing the Group’s own CO2 emissions (-10% CO2 emissions between
2019 and end-2022) has also been largely achieved, and the Group is
ahead on the public commitment to halve carbon emissions by the
end of 2030 compared with 2019.

The target of reducing the Group’s overall exposure to the oil and gas
extraction sector was strengthened in October 2022, over a three-year

Regarding the Chief Executive Officer

The Board of Directors considered that the target to deploy the
Group’s strategic plans had been achieved.

2022 was a decisive year from a strategic perspective. ALD’s acquisition
of LeasePlan and the joint venture with Bernstein will help drive the
Group’s goal of becoming the world leader in sustainable mobility and
the equity business. Boursorama’s development was accelerated
through the deal with ING, and significant inroads were made in the
merger of our two French Retail Banking networks.

The year was also marked by the war in Ukraine, which led to the
the geopolitical,
disposal of Rosbank and the deterioration of
economic and financial climate. In this particular context, the Board of
Directors focused on assessing the strategic decisions and their
implementation over and above a straightforward review of share
performance.

The 2025 trajectory was shared and well received by investors. As the
same time, Net Tangible Asset Value increased on the back of positive
annual net income, driven in particular by the strong performance of
its businesses.

In terms of securing the implementation of the Group’s IT and
digital transformation strategy, the Board of Directors considered
that several major advances were achieved during the year:
strengthened IT governance,
consolidated
monitoring, strong increase in the value created by data, and launch of
the IT Efficiency programme.

implementation of

The Board of Directors observed the smooth functioning of the new
organisation, with the Chief Executive Officer taking direct control of
supervising the Risk and Compliance functions in January 2022 and
the creation of a COO position. In particular, the Board noted the
positive impact of this development in terms of strengthening the

Group’s governance and regarding the relationship with banking
supervisory authorities. The SSM welcomed the initiatives launched by
the Bank,
the establishment of a programme to
strengthen the Group’s executive governance. The Board of Directors
noted the Chief Executive Officer’s commitment to ensuring a very
smooth transition with his successor.

in particular

p

Regarding the Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible for the
French and international networks

The Board of Directors considered that Boursorama’s growth and
profitability drivers had been consolidated by means of the very
successful implementation of strategic initiatives in France to onboard
individual customers
new customers and finalise the transfer of
following the deal with ING.
It noted Boursorama’s accelerated
development, with record annual growth in the number of new
customers: from 1.4 million to 4.7 million at the end of 2022.

European entities met the milestones of the digital transformation
trajectory and far exceeded digital-related revenue targets.

African entities launched several initiatives to upgrade the operational
model and information systems in order to optimise and secure
transactions, strengthen the entities’ digital footprint, and improve the
various subsidiaries’ performance.

The Board of Directors also observed that the plan to merge the
Societe Generale (BDDF) and Crédit du Nord networks launched in
January 2021 continued successfully in 2022. The milestones set out in
the 2022 roadmap were met (finalisation of negotiations with social
partners and of legal procedures ahead of the merger, launch of the
information systems transfer). Accordingly, the legal merger of the
Societe Generale and Crédit du Nord networks took place on 1 January
2023, as planned, and the new Retail Banking in France could be
launched.

Regarding the Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible for

The Board of Directors noted that, in 2022, all the necessary steps to
ensure the successful acquisition of LeasePlan by ALD were taken, in
particular complying with the social calendar, receiving the necessary
authorisations from the anti-trust authorities, and carrying out the
capital increase.

In terms of CSR, the Board of Directors observed the progress made in
