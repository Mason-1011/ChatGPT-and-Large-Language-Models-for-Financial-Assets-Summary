Welcome to our 2023 Annual Report 

We have adopted a digital-first approach to our reporting reflecting how we operate as a business. 
Whilst the Annual Report continues to be a core part of our reporting suite, we use a simplified 
format and include links to interactive online content, such as videos. We also provide summaries 
S
at the start of each key section (denoted by an 

 in the contents to the left). 

We continue to publish a separate report that summarises our progress towards meeting the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’), as well as a 
comprehensive addendum that includes data on Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) topics. 
This year, we have also published a separate cyber security factsheet which provides detail on our 
approach to managing cyber risk, as well as how we help our customers protect themselves.

ESG reporting
We also report against a number of voluntary reporting frameworks to help our stakeholders 
understand our sustainable business performance. Disclosures prepared in accordance with the 
Global Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (‘SASB’) guidance 
can be found in our ESG Addendum and on investors.vodafone.com respectively.

FY23 performance

Our purpose is to connect for a better future. 
We have a new roadmap for Vodafone based on

About Vodafone

Our business model

How we govern

We are a European and African telecommunications 
company which transforms the way our customers 
live and work through our innovation, technology, 
connectivity, platforms, products and services.

Where we operate
We operate mobile and fixed networks in 17 countries and have stakes in 
a further five countries through our joint ventures and associates. We also 
partner with mobile networks in 46 countries outside our footprint. Our 
portfolio of local markets is supported by corporate services and shared 
operations, which deliver benefits through scale and standardisation.

How we are structured and what we sell1
Our business is comprised of infrastructure assets, shared operations, 
growth platforms and retail and service operations. Our retail and service 
operations are split across three broad business lines: Europe Consumer, 
Vodafone Business and Africa Consumer. 

Core connectivity products and services in fixed and mobile account for 
the majority of our revenue. However, our portfolio also includes high 
return growth areas that leverage and complement our core connectivity 
business, such as digital services, the Internet of Things (‘IoT’) and financial 
services. We market and sell through digital and physical channels.

We provide a range of market leading mobile 
and fixed line connectivity services in our 
European markets. Our converged plans 
combine these offerings, providing simplicity 
and better value for our customers. Other value 
added services include our Consumer IoT 
propositions, as well as security and 
insurance products.

We serve private and public sector customers 
of all sizes with a broad range of connectivity 
services, supported by our dedicated global 
network. We have unique scale and capabilities, 
and are expanding our portfolio of products 
and services into growth areas such as unified 
communications, cloud & security, and IoT. 

We provide a range of mobile services. 
The demand for mobile data is growing rapidly 
driven by the lack of fixed broadband access 
and by increased smartphone penetration. 
Together with Vodacom’s VodaPay super-app 
and the M-Pesa payment platform, we are the 
leading provider of financial services, as well as 
business and merchant services in Africa.

Notes:
1.  Performance across our markets is summarised on pages 16 to 22.
2. 

Including Turkey.

Our business model is underpinned by our strong 
governance and risk management framework.

Governance
The Board held six scheduled meetings this year to discuss key strategic 
matters, our purpose and culture, our people and stakeholder interests.

The Nominations and Governance Committee evaluates the 
composition and performance of the Board and ensures an appropriate 
balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and diversity. 

The Audit and Risk Committee provides effective governance 
over the appropriateness of financial reporting of the Group, including 
the adequacy of related disclosures, the performance of the internal audit 
function and the external auditor and oversight of the Group’s systems of 
internal control, risk management framework and compliance activities. 

The ESG Committee oversees our Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’) programme, including our purpose pillars, 
sustainability and responsible business practices, and our contribution 
to the societies we operate in under our social contract. 

The Remuneration Committee advises the Board on policies for 
executive remuneration and reward packages for individual Executive 
Directors. The Committee also oversees general pay practices 
across the Group.

speak about their roles in short video interviews:

Risk management
Risks are not static and as the environment changes, so do risks – some 
diminish or increase, while new risks appear. We continuously review and 
improve our risk processes in order to ensure that the Company has the 
appropriate level of support in meeting its strategic objectives.

Our risk framework clearly defines roles and responsibilities, and sets 
out a consistent end-to-end process for identifying and managing risks. 
We have embedded the risk framework across the Group as this allows 
us to take a holistic approach and to make meaningful comparisons. 
Our approach is continuously enhanced, enabling more dynamic risk 
detection, modelling of risk interconnectedness and the use of data, 
all of which are improving our risk visibility and our responses.

Our Board oversees principal and emerging risks, which are reported 
to the various management committees and the Board throughout the 
year. Additionally, risk owners are invited to present in-depth reviews to 
ensure that risks are managed within the defined tolerance levels.

high-speed connections for both business and 
consumers.

Connected devices

 – Demand for connected devices, beyond 

smartphones, is growing rapidly.

 – The Internet of Things (‘IoT’) is expected to drive 
huge operational efficiencies, deliver real-time

range of use cases.

Vodafone Business 
investor briefing

Adoption of cloud technology

 – Large technology companies have invested 
heavily in advanced centralised data storage 
and processing capabilities that consumers can 
access remotely via cloud technology.

 – The cloud is increasingly utilised by businesses 
and consumers as a more efficient way of 
sharing capacity and services.

Vodafone Business 
investor briefing

Digital and green transformation for the  
private and public sector

 – The European Union has launched a series 
of funding programmes under the banner 
‘NextGenerationEU’, including a Recovery 
and Resilience facility which will also 
support the European Commission’s 
digital transformation agenda.

digitalise their operations to become more 
efficient and reduce their environmental impact.

Social contract 
investor briefing

Digital payments and financial services

 – The trend towards more digital forms of 

payment is growing, with a broader range of

A new roadmap for Vodafone
This year has been a challenging one for Vodafone 
and for many of our customers, following the rise 
in energy costs and broader inflation. We have taken 
a number of steps to mitigate the impact of these 
cost pressures.

However, as a Board, we recognise that the Company 
has also underperformed, and that change is needed. 
This will require a transformation of the Group, 
so that Vodafone can realise its full potential.

Group Chief Executive succession
In December 2022, we announced that Nick Read would step down 
as Group Chief Executive. The Board and I would like to thank Nick for 
his commitment and significant contribution to Vodafone throughout his 
career spanning more than two decades with the Company.

The Board has undertaken a rigorous internal and external search to find 
the best possible candidate, and in April 2023 I was delighted to announce 
the appointment of Margherita Della Valle as Group Chief Executive. 
Margherita has a strong track record during her long career at Vodafone 
in marketing, operational, commercial and financial positions. During her 
time as interim Group Chief Executive, the Board and I have been impressed 
with her pace and decisiveness to begin the necessary transformation 
of the Company. Margherita has the full support of myself and the Board 
for her plans for Vodafone to provide a better customer experience, 
become a simpler business and accelerate growth – and deliver value 
for our shareholders.

Board composition
As I wrote last year, my ambition for this year was to further enhance 
the Board’s experience within the telecommunications and technology 
sectors. I was therefore pleased to welcome four new Non-Executive 
Directors to the Board this year: Stephen Carter, Delphine Ernotte Cunci, 
Simon Segars and Christine Ramon. Their appointments bring extensive 
experience and strong track records of value creation, which will be 
of great support to the Group. 

On 10 May 2023, the Board approved the creation of a Technology 
Committee as a Committee of the Board. The Technology Committee, 
once established in due course, will oversee the technology strategy 
and how it supports the overall Company strategy. The creation of a 
Technology Committee – run by the highly experienced team of Simon 
Segars, Stephen Carter, Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Deborah Kerr 
– will be a great additional benefit to the Board and to Vodafone. On the 
same date, having completed either 9 years or almost 9 years, we also 
announced that Valerie Gooding, Sir Crispin Davis and Dame Clara Furse 
would not be seeking re-election at the 2023 Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’). I would like to thank my colleagues for their outstanding service 
to the Company and look forward to their continuing contribution 
until the AGM. In light of these retirements and following a review of 
committee membership, a number of Non-Executive Directors will take 
on new roles, including David Nish, who will be appointed Senior 
Independent Director.

On 11 May 2023, we announced that we had agreed a strategic 
relationship with Emirates Telecommunications Group Company PJSC 
(“e&”). This marks the next phase in a strategic relationship that began last 
year, and I’m delighted we have strengthened our existing relationship 
with e&, which will bring additional telecoms experience to our Board 
in the future.

Notes:

1.  This is a non-GAAP measure. See page 219 for more information.
2.  Proforma ratio after adjusting for foreign exchange and M&A.

FY23 financial performance
Our financial results for FY23 have been in line with expectations for the 
year. Total revenue increased by 0.3% to €45.7 billion, with Group organic 
service revenue growing by 2.2% this year. This was driven by continued 
good growth in the UK, Other Europe and Africa, partially offset by 
declines in Germany, Italy and Spain.
Adjusted EBITDAaL declined by 1.3%1 reflecting the impact of higher 
energy costs and commercial underperformance in Germany. These 
factors more than offset the benefits of service revenue growth and a 
further €0.2 billion of savings from our ongoing European cost efficiency 
programme. Our reported financials were also impacted by adverse 
currency movements during the year. Overall Group returns were broadly 
maintained, with a return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) of 6.8% on a 
pre-tax basis (excluding Vantage Towers)1. Group operating profit 
increased by 146% to €14.3 billion, largely reflecting a gain on disposal 
from Vantage Towers, and as a result basic earnings per share increased 
to 42.77 eurocents.

Following the successful disposal of Vodafone Hungary and partial sale 
of Vantage Towers, our balance sheet position has also improved, with 
Group leverage now at 2.5x.2 The Board has declared a total dividend 
per share of 9.0 eurocents, implying a final dividend per share of 4.5 
eurocents, which will be paid on 4 August 2023 following shareholder 
approval at our AGM.

Taking a leadership role in shaping the future 
of digital connectivity
Over the last few years, we have seen significant shifts in society and the 
direct role telecoms plays. Digital connectivity is an important priority for 
governments as it increasingly impacts the relative competitiveness and 
resilience of countries.

Vodafone is firmly committed to supporting Europe and Africa in realising 
their digital ambitions. However, in order to do so, investment in digital 
infrastructure is critical. While the European Union has set out a clear 
vision and Digital Decade targets for a more sustainable and prosperous 
future, there is currently an estimated €300 billion gap between their 
ambitions and Europe’s current investment plans. 

This investment gap is primarily due to the unintended consequences of 
past policy and regulatory decisions, which have impacted returns for the 
telecommunications industry. Returns have remained below the cost of 
capital for over a decade, restricting the appetite for further investment. 

Whilst we welcome a number of positive reforms towards pro-investment 
policy, the current pace and magnitude of change is not enough. Further 
pro-investment policy reform is required to drive growth and scale in the 
sector. If delivered, it would enable operators to earn a sustainable return 
and support the much-needed investment required to safeguard Europe 
and Africa’s global competitiveness.

Going forward
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our colleagues across 
the Group who have continued to work tirelessly to support our 
customers – keeping them reliably connected. 

As we enter FY24, the macroeconomic outlook still remains uncertain. 
I am confident that under Margherita’s leadership we will improve the 
Company’s performance and drive value for all of our stakeholders.

Chief Executive’s statement and strategic roadmap

Delivery through Customers, Simplicity & Growth
“Today I am announcing my plans for Vodafone. 
Our performance has not been good enough. 
To consistently deliver, Vodafone must change. 
My priorities are customers, simplicity and growth. 
We will simplify our organisation, cutting out 
complexity to regain our competitiveness. We will 
reallocate resources to deliver the quality service 
our customers expect and drive further growth from 
the unique position of Vodafone Business.”

Our purpose is to connect for a better future. 
We have a new roadmap for Vodafone based on 
three priorities: customers, simplicity and growth. 
We must make four key strategic shifts.

Key strategic shifts

Our transformation

Margherita Della Valle, Group Chief Executive

We set out below a new roadmap for Vodafone, following a strategic 
review conducted over the last five months.

1. Vodafone must change
The circumstances of our industry and the position of Vodafone within it, 
require us to change. 

 – The European telecommunications sector has amongst the lowest 

return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) of any sector in Europe, alongside 
the highest capital investment demands. This has resulted in ROCE 
being below the weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’) for over 
a decade, impacting total shareholder returns.

 – More importantly, the comparative performance of Vodafone has 

worsened over time, which is connected to our customer experience.
 – Our market position and performance varies by geography and segment. 
Where we have the right combination of strong local execution and a 
rational market structure, we can grow and drive returns. There are also 
material differences between our Consumer and Business segments, 
with Business growing in nearly all of our European markets

 – Our turnaround must be built from our strengths, but we need to 

overcome some clear challenges. We are more complex than we need 
to be, which limits our local commercial agility.

2. Strategic shifts
Our target is to be a best-in-class telco in Europe and Africa, and become 
Europe’s leading platform for Business. To achieve this, we must change 
in four essential areas.

 – We will rebalance our organisation to maximise the potential of 
Vodafone Business, which continues to accelerate growth, and 
we believe has a unique set of capabilities and has a strong position 
in a large and growing market as organisations digitalise.

 – In order to win in our consumer markets, we will refocus on the basics 
and deliver the simple & predictable experience our customers expect.

 – We will be a leaner and simpler organisation, to increase our 

commercial agility and free up resources.

We will focus our resources on a portfolio of products and geographies 
that is right-sized for growth and returns over time.

3. Our action plan
To execute the change in these four areas, we have an action plan already 
underway, focused around three priorities: Customers, Simplicity and 
Growth. Early examples of this action plan include:

 – Customers: Significant investment reallocated in FY24 towards 

customer experience and brand; 

 – Simplicity: 11,000 role reductions planned over three years, with both 

headquarters and local markets simplification; and

 – Growth: Germany turnaround plan, continued pricing action and 

strategic review in Spain.

We will change the level of ambition, speed and decisiveness of execution. 
We will have empowered markets focused on customers, scale up 
Vodafone Business and take out complexity to simplify how we operate.

Long-term trends shaping our industry
Digital services and next-generation connectivity 
are increasingly central to everything we do – and 
will be the driving forces that redefine relationships 
between sectors, employers, employees, customers, 
and friends and family. 

In environments that are more localised, such as factories and ports, 
network operators are building and running Mobile Private Networks 
(‘MPNs’). MPNs offer corporate customers unparalleled security and 
bespoke network control. As an example, MPNs enable autonomous 
factories to connect to thousands of robots, enabling them to work 
in a synchronised way. Once a product leaves the factory it can also 
be tracked seamlessly through global supply chain management 
applications, whether it is delivered through the post, in a vehicle or 
even via drones.

In areas where the same solution can be deployed across multiple 
sectors, network operators are moving beyond connectivity to 
provide complex end-to-end hardware and software solutions such 
as surveillance, smart metering and remote monitoring; it is often more 
efficient for these solutions to be created in-house. Scaled operators 
can leverage their unique position to co-create or partner with nimble 
start-ups at attractive economics.

As the number of IoT devices increases, physical assets are also 
communicating with each other in real-time and new digital markets 
are being established. This is leading to the Economy of Things, where 
connected devices securely trade with each other on a user’s behalf, 
without human intervention. This presents businesses across multiple 
industries with exciting opportunities to transform goods into tradeable 
digital assets which can compete in new disruptive online markets.

Adoption of cloud technology
Over the past decade, large technology companies have invested heavily 
in advanced centralised data storage and processing capabilities that 
organisations and consumers can access remotely through connectivity 
services (commonly termed ‘cloud’ technology). As a result, organisations 
and consumers are increasingly moving away from using their own 
expensive hardware and device-specific software to using more efficient 
shared hardware capacity or services through the cloud. This is popular 
as it allows upfront capital investment savings, the ability to efficiently 
scale resources to meet demand, systems that can be easily updated and 
increased resilience. This is driving demand for fast, reliable and secure 
connectivity with lower latency.

Many small businesses increasingly understand the benefits of cloud 
technology; however, they lack the technical expertise or direct 
relationships with large enterprise and cloud specialists. This presents an 
opportunity for network operators, particularly those with strong existing 
relationships, as they can effectively help customers navigate their move 
to the cloud at scale.

There are five ‘mega trends’ that we believe will 
continue to shape our industry in the years ahead: 
hybrid working, connected devices, adoption 
of cloud technology, the digital and green 
transformation of public and private sectors, and 
digital payments.

Hybrid working 
Over the past few years we have seen a dramatic shift in working 
patterns, which are now being maintained following the end of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Companies have now moved from largely 
office-based environments to more ‘hybrid’ working models, thereby 
providing their employees with much greater flexibility as to how and 
where they work, whilst still ensuring high or even increased levels 
of productivity. This change in working patterns will continue to drive 
increased demand for fast and reliable fixed and mobile networks, as well 
as a range of supporting services such as cloud-based productivity and 
communication platforms.

The majority of large multinationals already have remote working 
capabilities; however they are now moving to more efficient technologies. 
Smaller companies, ranging from corporates to small and medium-sized 
offices, rely on network operators such as Vodafone to provide secure 
remote working solutions. These solutions include virtual private 
networks, unified communication services and the migration of enterprise 
applications to the cloud. This is vital for business continuity, and it 
provides network operators with an opportunity to further deepen their 
customer relationships by offering a broad range of services. 

Connected devices
The world is becoming ever more connected, and it is not just driven 
by smartphones. A wide range of new devices, across all sectors and 
applications, are increasingly being connected to the internet. These 
connected devices, known as the Internet of Things (‘IoT’), are expected 
to increase by around 55% to over 23 billion devices by 20251. This is 
driven by continued reductions in the cost of computing components, 
advances in cross-device operability and software, and the near-ubiquity 
of networks. 

For consumers, there is a growing range of applications such as 
smartwatches, tracking devices for pets, bags and bicycles, and connected 
vehicles – which can lower insurance premiums and enable a range 
of advanced in-vehicle solutions. 

For businesses, the demand for IoT and potential use cases is even more 
evident. These include solutions such as automated monitoring of energy 
usage across national grids, tracking consumption in smart buildings and 
detecting traffic and congestion in cities.

Mega trends

Long-term trends shaping our industry

In environments that are more localised, such as factories and ports, 

network operators are building and running Mobile Private Networks 

(‘MPNs’). MPNs offer corporate customers unparalleled security and 

bespoke network control. As an example, MPNs enable autonomous 

factories to connect to thousands of robots, enabling them to work 

in a synchronised way. Once a product leaves the factory it can also 

be tracked seamlessly through global supply chain management 

applications, whether it is delivered through the post, in a vehicle or 

even via drones.

In areas where the same solution can be deployed across multiple 

sectors, network operators are moving beyond connectivity to 

provide complex end-to-end hardware and software solutions such 

as surveillance, smart metering and remote monitoring; it is often more 

efficient for these solutions to be created in-house. Scaled operators 

can leverage their unique position to co-create or partner with nimble 

start-ups at attractive economics.

Digital services and next-generation connectivity 

are increasingly central to everything we do – and 

will be the driving forces that redefine relationships 

between sectors, employers, employees, customers, 

and friends and family. 

There are five ‘mega trends’ that we believe will

Larger corporates, which may already use the cloud today, are 
progressively moving away from complex systems based on their own 
servers or single cloud solutions, to multi-cloud offers sold by network 
operators and their partners. This approach reduces supplier risk and 
increases corporate agility and resilience. Large corporates continue to 
drive higher demand for robust, secure and efficient connectivity services 
as they transition from their own legacy hardware and services. Cloud 
providers also recognise the criticality of telecommunications networks. 
Many cloud providers are partnering with the largest network operators, 
sometimes through revenue sharing agreements, to develop edge 
computing solutions which integrate data centres at the edge of 
telecommunication networks to deliver customers reduced latency. 
The opportunity is significant as the total addressable market in 
business-to-business cloud & security is expected to reach €82 billion 
by 2025 compared to €65 billion today. 

Consumers use cloud solutions for a variety of reasons, including 
digital storage, online media consumption or interacting through the 
metaverse. Consumer hardware can also in some cases be replaced 
by cloud-first solutions. For example, new cloud-based gaming services 
allow consumers to stream complex, bandwidth-heavy computer 
games directly to their phones or tablets, without the need for expensive 
dedicated hardware. Fast and reliable connectivity will act as a catalyst 
for further innovation and consumer applications, many of which do 
not currently exist today.

Digital and green transformation of the 
public and private sectors
As a part of the fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European 
Union has launched a series of funding programmes with €723.8 billion 
available under the banner ‘NextGenerationEU’. This includes the 
Recovery and Resilience facility, which combines €385.5 billion of loans 
and €338 billion of grants available to European Union Member States. 
Of these grants, approximately 70% are being allocated to European 
Union Member States in which Vodafone has an operating presence. 
The range of funding presents a direct and indirect opportunity given 
that at least 20% of the total funding is planned to support the European 
Commission’s digital transformation agenda.

The UK and many of our African markets have similar stimulus measures 
in place. These support measures will help connect schools, hospitals 
and businesses to gigabit networks and provide hardware, such as tablets, 
to millions of school children. 

Similarly, the European Union has committed to be carbon-neutral 
by 2050. Mobile network operators across Europe will be able to benefit 
from these funds as they seek to limit their impact on the climate, and 
help their customers from across the private and public sectors reduce 
their own energy use and carbon emissions.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs’) in Europe can often lag 
behind in terms of digital adoption. However, under various government-
led support mechanisms, SMEs will be eligible for vouchers, grants 
and loans to transition to eCommerce, upskill employees, and move 
to cloud-based solutions whilst ensuring they are secure as they do so. 
SMEs will look to trusted and experienced network operators which can 
offer a full suite of solutions, whilst also help them navigate technical and 
regulatory processes. Finally, to ensure the benefits of these projects are 
spread equitably, funding is also being allocated towards rural inclusion 
to subsidise the building of network infrastructure where it is currently 
uneconomical for operators to do so.

and sustainable digital society on pages 35 to 38

Digital payments 
Businesses in Europe continue to expand and migrate sales channels 
from physical premises to online channels such as websites and 
mobile applications. As a result, businesses increasingly transact 
through mobile-enabled payment services which remove the 
need for legacy fixed sales terminals. Consequently, businesses 
demand reliable and secure mobile connectivity. Consumers are also 
increasingly transitioning away from using cash to digital payment 
methods conducted directly via mobile phones or smartwatches, 
further increasing the importance of mobile networks. 

In Africa, digital payments are primarily conducted via mobile phones 
through payment networks owned and operated by network operators, 
and the annual value of mobile money transactions has reached a key 
milestone in 2021 with one trillion transactions globally1. Consumers 
are also moving beyond peer-to-peer transactions as rising smartphone 
penetration drives the adoption of mobile payment applications. Network 
operators and a range of FinTech startups are using these applications to 
sell additional financial services focused products, ranging from advances 
on mobile airtime and device insurance to more complex offerings 
such as life insurance, loans and e-commerce marketplaces. This plays 
a critical role in improving financial inclusion for millions of people across 
Africa where the traditional banking sector has not been able to reach.

Businesses are also increasingly reliant on operator-owned payment 
infrastructure for consumer-to-business payments and for large 
business-to-business transfers. These payment networks drive scale 
benefits for the largest operators by allowing customers to save on 
transaction fees whilst also driving both business and consumer 
customers to seek reliable and secure networks.

Our people strategy 
Our people strategy is to create an inclusive 
environment for growth where everyone has the 
opportunity to thrive. Our engaged and experienced 
team are a key strength and will support us as we 
begin the transformation of Vodafone.

 The Spirit of Vodafone

Our culture – the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ – outlines the beliefs we stand for 
and the behaviours that enable our strategy and purpose.

We foster our culture by developing individual habits that reinforce our 
Spirit, invest in leadership development to role model our beliefs, and 
ensure systems, processes and milestone activities are aligned with the 
Spirit of Vodafone. We measure our progress and identify where to take 
action via a bi-annual employee survey called ‘Spirit Beat’. In our latest 
Spirit Beat survey (September 2022), we had an 83% response rate and 
sustained high scores in engagement, connection to purpose and Spirit.

Note:
This year we expanded our listening strategy and as part of this unified our scoring methodology 
to a 5-point scale and favourable percentage (from a 7-point scale and weighted average). This new 
scoring methodology provides less choice and greater distinction so any change between -3 to -5 
points for Spirit Beat is likely due to the scale change, rather than a real decline.
1.  The Team Spirit Index represents an overall view of how people are doing on the Spirit 

of Vodafone and takes into account each of our Spirit Behaviours.

The Spirit Beat survey informs our priorities which include a focus 
on ensuring new starters and managers are engaged with our Spirit. 
New starters who joined during the pandemic were scoring slightly 
lower on Spirit and engagement compared to other colleagues (-1 point). 
In response, we redesigned our onboarding processes and support 
globally. In September 2022, new hires reported higher Spirit and 
engagement scores compared to other colleagues (+9 points), 
highlighting the impact that listening and focused action can have. 
Managers that act on Spirit outperform those who do not take action 
on average by 18 points on Spirit and 22 points on engagement. This has 
informed our new approach to performance development and how we 
support and hold managers accountable for their impact.

We continue to evolve our employee listening strategy and deepen the 
connection between employee and customer experiences by opening  
up more channels. During the year, this included a pulse survey sent in 
June 2022, the results of which were used to inform our hybrid ways  
of working. Our listening strategy also includes standardising our 
onboarding and exit listening approach globally. Results show that 71% 
of leavers would recommend Vodafone as a great place to work (based 
on 2,066 responses). As part of our focus on one of our Spirit behaviours, 
earning customer loyalty, our Spirit Beat survey was extended in 
September to include contractors in customer-facing roles in five  
markets (76% response rate). This has enabled markets to celebrate  
high customer scores, while also identifying opportunities to be  
more effective. Based on the success of the pilot, we extended  
contractor measurement to further markets in April 2023.

Once a quarter, we have a ‘Spirit of Vodafone Day’ which is dedicated 
time to focus on learning, connection and wellbeing. During our Spirit 
of Vodafone Day in February 2023, 80% more online learning hours were 
recorded compared to a typical day in the financial year up until that point. 
Colleagues took the opportunity to focus on earning customer loyalty 
and this was facilitated through new learning materials that include 
Consumer and Vodafone Business customer feedback and net 
promoter scores.

Leadership at Vodafone
Leadership is essential for enabling transformation, and we have 
continually invested in developing inclusive leaders who drive growth 
and innovation, act as role models, coach and empower teams, and 
lead with Spirit.

In April 2022, we launched a Spirit Accelerator, which aims to increase 
accountability and ownership of our strategic priorities by our senior 
leaders. Further to this, we launched ‘CEO accelerator’, an exciting and 
varied programme of support to accelerate the leadership transition and 
develop new local market CEOs. We have introduced tools to support 
the development of our leaders and our selection process includes 
an independent assessment. Executive coaching is now available to all 
leaders through a platform-based approach and we support the broader 
leadership population through an internal network of accredited coaches.

Senior leadership is accountable for our culture transformation, whilst 
the Board reviews progress on employee engagement and Spirit on a 
regular basis, and the Executive Committee monitors key achievements 
and considers further opportunities to embed Spirit. We continue to do this 
through Company policies and improvements to employee experience 
through our ‘moments that matter’ programme. We are supporting 
leaders to demonstrate Spirit as they transition with their teams into hybrid 
working and are using updated leadership assessment methodologies to 
reflect Spirit behaviours. We also run a global recognition programme that 
celebrates those who demonstrate our Spirit behaviours.

Innovation at Vodafone
We continue to develop ‘LaunchPad’, our global employee-led 
innovation platform which helps ‘Create the Future’. In the three years 
since it has been operational, our employees have submitted over 
2,000 ideas, ranging from e-waste recycling, Internet of Things (‘IoT’) 
marketplaces and cloud smartphones. We are seeing the value these 
ideas have. For example, ‘Scam Signal’ is a Vodafone application that 
helps businesses combat fraud and cyber crime by utilising our network 
to identify bank transfer scams in real time. LaunchPad has delivered 
€15 million annualised value from ideas executed since inception and 
this year 360 colleagues provided ideas based on using Vodafone 
technology to solve environmental challenges.

 Simplified operating model

We recently simplified the Group’s operating model to execute our 
strategy, accelerate and streamline performance, and improve customer 
experience. Key commercial decisions have moved back to markets, and 
this is supported by a new governance structure. Group functions will 
remain committed to governance, performance management, shared 
operations, and best practice programmes that uphold global standards.

 Diverse talent and future ready skills

In April 2022, we launched a new operating model for learning, talent, 
leadership, and skills – the global Vodafone Learning Organisation (‘VLO’) 
– which has already started to drive simplification across our markets, 
while enabling a high quality development experience for employees. 
We have already begun to realise the benefits of this operating model 
change with higher quality streamlined global learning offerings.

We are focused on developing diverse talent with the skills to transform 
Vodafone and this is reflected by four strategic pillars which are 
summarised on the following page.

Our people strategy (continued)

1. Enable a high impact performance & learning culture
We continue to support the personal and professional growth of people 
through online learning initiatives. During the year, our employees 
accomplished two million hours of learning with an average of 1.7 hours 
per month. The annual average number of hours per employee has 
increased by 33% per employee since FY22, with each employee now 
spending 20 hours on average per annum on their learning. We invested 
an average of €301 for both mandatory and non-mandatory training for 
each employee to build future capabilities.

To support customer experience, we have launched customer-centric 
programmes for all employees including a Company-wide customer 
experience curriculum.

In April 2023, we launched a new performance management system and 
process to increase alignment and prioritisation of goals, enable greater 
employee ownership, and create a shared understanding of the impact 
an employee has on outcomes. Performance assessments consider 
the impact an employee has had on team, business, and customer 
outcomes and how the Spirit of Vodafone has been harnessed to deliver 
those outcomes. Reward will be linked to the individual’s impact and 
underpinned by minimum performance standards, including completion 
of our Doing What’s Right training, that reinforce our commitment to 
building an ethical culture.

2. Build the skills for the future
This year, we strategically reviewed the skills that we need to support our 
business strategy. From April 2023 we started to deliver Skill Accelerators 
across the organisation for critical skill areas such as agile project 
management, software engineering, automation, and cyber security.

In Italy, more than 300 people have been reskilled from contact centres 
to other internal functions. Large-scale programmes on digital skills have 
impacted employees in Italy, reflected by more than one million learning 
hours delivered. We are also introducing a global software engineering 
reskilling programme. Successful applicants began training in May 2023.

As part of our ambition to hire 7,000 software engineers by 2025, 
we enhanced our employer brand awareness by launching a global 
recruiting playbook, investing in talent acquisition campaigns, running 
events across markets, and redesigning the global careers site. So far, 
we have hired 5,880 software engineers. This year, we also launched 
a specific ‘Always-on Software Engineer’ attraction campaign in Egypt, 
Germany, Spain, Turkey, Romania, Portugal and the UK. As a result, 
we have had 42.8 million impressions. Moreover, last year we were a 
platinum sponsor at the React Summit, an annual conference gathering 
thousands of software engineers from around the world. This had a 
positive impact as 77% of engineers we interacted with had an improved 
perception of Vodafone as a technology employer following the event.

Our technical career path supports the attraction, retention and 
development of our technical experts and sits alongside a managerial/
leadership career path. The technical career path is designed to provide 
more formal ways to recognise and reward career progression for 
technical experts, giving choice in career direction.

careers.vodafone.com/life-at-vodafone/projects-stories

3. Drive an efficient engine with the scale and expertise to deliver 
on our growth ambitions
We simplified the operations of the VLO by leveraging vendor partnerships, 
and launching global product offerings on agile project management, 
languages and executive coaching. We removed duplicated activities 
across markets by continuing to expand our _VOIS shared services team. 
We also conducted global demand planning for our learning, talent, 
leadership and skills to align our investments with our strategic objectives.

4. Engage and retain diverse talent, and unlock potential through 
focused succession and people development
We reviewed our talent and succession pools across senior roles. 
These are ultimately discussed and approved at the annual Executive 
Committee talent review and are also shared with the Board. Gender 
diversity of the executive succession pools increased to 50% from 38% 
in the prior year. This year, we also reviewed our commercial capabilities 
by reviewing the skills we need for the future, assessing the capability 
of current and future leaders, and developing learning journeys and 
targeted development actions. We further embedded these assessment 
tools and strategies into our overall processes for developing and 
recruiting senior leaders across the business.

We continue to invest in youth hiring (5,731 hires, of which 942 were 
graduates) whilst providing digital learning experiences to 66,036 young 
people through local work experience programmes and training 
initiatives. During the year, we also hired 236 apprentices with local 
programmes that aim to grow future talent and skills in areas such as 
cyber security, network engineering and software engineering through 
work-based learning and qualifications.

 Digital and personalised experience

Future ready ways of working
This year, we reviewed our Future Ready Vodafone global policy on 
hybrid working, which includes the option to work from another country 
during the year for a maximum of 20 days. To continue our commitment 
to hybrid ways of working, we believe a minimum of two days in the office 
is the right balance to achieve the benefits of in-person collaboration and 
our leaders are expected to clearly role-model this. We are not mandating 
a fixed day per week at a function or market level as this compromises 
the principle of flexibility that hybrid working is built on. Underpinning all 
our hybrid thinking is our continued commitment to the health, safety, 
and wellbeing of our teams.

Office space
The shift to hybrid working has redefined the role of the office and 
inspired us to create a new global office design primarily for collaboration 
and connection. We experimented in different countries last year, 
redesigned the Vodafone Turkey headquarters, and opened a new 
office in Valencia, and a new Innovation Hub in Malaga. These are great 
examples of the hybrid workplace improving the employees’ experience 
and being a magnet to attract talent, collaborate, and innovate.

A new initiative called ‘Office in a Box’ was implemented to support 
employees’ wellbeing while working from home, providing a virtual 
office setup at home following a self-assessment. We are also improving 
the digital workplace experience with new booking systems for desks 
and collaboration spaces, access control, video conferencing, and 
presentation facilities to enhance the employee experience at the office.

the digital workplace experience with new booking systems for desks 

and collaboration spaces, access control, video conferencing, and 

presentation facilities to enhance the employee experience at the office.

Mental health and wellbeing
We remain focused on physical and mental wellbeing, with training 
and services available in each market, including the provision of 
employee assistance and psychological support services. Market 
examples from the year include:

 – Vodafone Egypt became one of the first companies in the Middle East, 

as well as in our Vodafone markets, to be verified against ISO 
45003:2021 for psychological health and safety at work.

 – In Italy, we organised awareness and training sessions, including 

mindfulness sessions, a webinar with a team of psychologists during 
Mental Health Week, and a session on social welfare services.

 – In the UK we continued our third year of support for the 245 mental 
health first aiders across the business. We facilitated six bi-monthly 
learning sessions across a range of topics on mental health. In May 
2022, we delivered a two-hour workshop to 400 employees during 
UK Mental Health Awareness Week and introduced a new service 
for people to access professional therapy.

 – In South Africa, we launched an onsite financial coach and counselling 
clinic in February 2023 and established the Wellbeing Committee 
on employee wellbeing needs. We also held 10 wellbeing café sessions 
on a range of topics including mental health, finance, resilience, 
anxiety, and trauma (2,235 participants).

 – Finally in Spain, we launched the rercárgate wellbeing programme, 
engaging more than 1,260 colleagues in wellbeing programmes.

Digital experience
This year, we continued to focus on providing a digital and personalised 
experience to employees, informed by internal insights, and underpinned 
by our culture. This has included digitalising our core HR processes, 
ensuring we have the right tools and data to deliver the people strategy.

In 2022, we launched ‘Grow with Vodafone’, an integrated talent 
acquisition, skills and learning platform that enhances the employee 
experience, whilst giving employees greater ownership of their learning 
and career development. The tool is split into three main features:

 – Grow your skills: Enables individuals to create their unique skills 

profile enabling personalised learning and career recommendations, 
as well as providing upskilling opportunities.

 – Grow your learning: Offers personalised learning recommendations 
to help each employee achieve their career goals, whilst also driving 
a culture where growing never stops.

 – Grow your career: Provides role recommendations based on skills 

and experience to candidates, and offers optimised recruiter and hiring 
manager experience by prioritising the most suitable applications.

This has had the following impact:

 – Candidate experience: Job recommendations based on an 

individual’s skills and experience (driven by an AI role-matching 
engine). This is facilitated by 66% of roles being auto-calibrated.
 – Gender diversity: For management roles a higher proportion 

of women shortlisted, supported by efforts to remove unconscious 
bias during screening.

 – Recruiter capability: Increased effectiveness of recruiters, as 

reflected by a reduction in time-to-hire time by 49%, enabled through 
AI-based sourcing capabilities.

To standardise and improve the experience of new joiners, we deployed 
a new digital onboarding tool in November 2022. It has received 
an effectiveness score of 86% from new joiners and 83% from hiring 
managers over a baseline of 80%.

We continued to invest in our AI chatbot called, ‘TOBi’, to provide 
personalised instant responses and process administrative tasks. 
New features have been piloted in Vodacom Group and _VOIS India, 
with roll-out plans to UK employees in FY24. In FY23, TOBi resolved 53% 
of queries that would have been actioned by other support channels.

We have also implemented a new quality tool to check and correct HR 
data against pre-set rules to enable richer and more accurate insights 
on employee experience. The tool has already fixed 98% of errors. 
We continue to invest in our data strategy by bringing together and 
visualising both HR and non-HR data through cloud-based data-lake 
functionality, and this is reflected in pilots in Greece and _VOIS.

Workers’ councils and union engagement
We respect freedom of association and recognise the rights of 
employees to join trade unions and engage in collective bargaining in 
accordance with local law. We continue to maintain strong relationships 
with workers’ councils and unions through their representatives and we 
have almost 23,000 people covered by collective bargaining agreements 
across our global footprint. As an example, unions in Spain are supported 
through infrastructure and resources which employees have access to 
through union halls, digital and physical forums, and regular newsletters. 
This year, we reached agreements with unions in Spain and Italy on 
items such as pay, hybrid working and training as we continued to 
shape the future of work.

Employee forums
We have a number of employee forums where elected employee 
representatives represent the views of their colleagues. During the year, 
the Board’s Workforce Engagement Lead, Valerie Gooding, attended 
employee forums to gather employee views, such as the European 
Employee Consultative Committee. Key discussion topics from the 
meetings included talent development, future ready ways of working, 
cost of living support, and business performance.

Read more about the Board’s engagement with the  
employee voice on pages 62, 64 and 85

Pay and benefits
As part of the people experience, we continue to ensure pay, benefits, 
and wellbeing propositions are competitive and fair. Pay is typically 
reviewed on an annual basis, with increases aligned to an individual’s level 
of skills and experience, as well as external factors like market competition 
and inflation. Our total reward approach also encourages collective 
performance and ‘in-the-moment’ recognition. For example, 21,335 
peer-to-peer ‘Thank You’s’ and 65,258 cash Vodafone Star awards were 
issued through a digital recognition tool during the year. We continue to 
apply Fair Pay principles across all markets, working with the Fair Wage 
Network to ensure a good standard of living in each market. In the UK, 
our commitment to these principles is reflected in being an Accredited 
Living Wage employer.

Notes:
1.  The FY23 results reflect average foreign exchange rates of €1:£0.86, €1:INR 83.69, €1:ZAR 17.69, €1:TRY 18.53 and €1: EGP 23.72.
2.  The results for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that Indus Towers Limited is no longer reported as held for sale. There is no impact on previously reported revenue and 
adjusted EBITDAaL. However, operating profit, profit before taxation and profit for the financial year have all increased by €149 million compared to amounts previously reported. Consequently, basic 
earnings per share increased by 0.51c and adjusted basic earnings per share increased by 0.65c compared to amounts previously reported. See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ 
in the consolidated financial statements for more information.

3.  Adjusted EBITDAaL and adjusted basic earnings per share are non-GAAP measures. See page 219 for more information.

Total revenue decreased by 0.1% to €13.1 billion, driven by lower service 
revenue partially offset by higher equipment sales.

Total revenue declined 4.2% to €4.8 billion due to lower service revenue 
and equipment sales.

Service revenue declined by 2.9%* (Q3: -3.3%*, Q4: -2.7%*), as a result 
of continued price pressure in the mobile value segment, partly offset 
by strong Business demand in fixed line and digital services.

Mobile service revenue declined by 5.4%* (Q3: -5.7%*, Q4: -5.4%*). 
Price competition in the mobile value segment has remained intense, 
resulting in a lower active prepaid customer base and ARPU. 
This was partially offset by targeted pricing actions taken during 
the year. Our second brand ‘ho.’ continued to grow and now has 
3.0 million customers.

Fixed service revenue increased by 3.3%* (Q3: 2.7%*, Q4: 3.6%*) 
supported by strong Business demand for connectivity and digital 
services, including a good take up of the Business voucher programme, 
an initiative related to the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility that 
subsidises high-speed broadband connectivity. This was partially 
offset by a slightly lower customer base in Consumer broadband. 
Our broadband customer base declined by 55,000 during the year, 
however this was largely offset by 47,000 fixed-wireless additions 
which are reported in mobile. Our Consumer converged customer 
base now stands at 1.4 million, and in total 56% of our broadband 
customers are converged.

Our next generation network (‘NGN’) broadband services are now 
available to 23.5 million households, including 9.4 million through 
our own network and our partnership with Open Fiber. In October 2022, 
we launched 5G fixed-wireless services and now cover 3.4 million 
households. This complements our 4G fixed-wireless access products, 
which covers an additional 2.2 million households. 

Adjusted EBITDAaL declined by 14.5%* including a 5.7 percentage point 
impact relating to a €105 million legal settlement received in the prior 
year, and 3.0 percentage points due to higher energy costs. Adjusted 
EBITDAaL growth was also impacted by lower mobile service revenue, 
partly offset by our continued strong focus on cost efficiency. 
The adjusted EBITDAaL margin was 3.6* percentage points lower 
year-on-year at 30.2%.

On an organic basis, service revenue declined by 1.6%* (Q3: -1.8%*, Q4: 
-2.8%*) due to broadband customer losses and a lower mobile ARPU, 
partially offset by higher roaming revenue and broadband ARPU growth. 
The slowdown in quarterly trends was primarily driven by small 
one-off benefits in Q4 last year and the impact of a multi-year IoT 
contract renewal.

Fixed service revenue declined by 1.8%* (Q3: -2.0%*, Q4: -2.1%*), driven 
by a lower broadband customer base, primarily as a result of specific 
operational challenges related to the implementation of policies to 
comply with the 2021 Telecommunications Act, which are now resolved. 
This was partially offset by ARPU growth. In November 2022 we 
increased prices for new broadband customers, and in March 2023, 
we started to communicate price increases to some of our existing 
customers, which will be implemented during H1 FY24. Our cable 
broadband customer base declined by 119,000 and we lost 87,000 DSL 
broadband customers during the year. As expected, our commercial 
performance in Q4 was impacted by the decision to increase retail prices. 

Our TV customer base declined by 412,000 and our converged customer 
base decreased by 52,000 to 2.3 million Consumer converged accounts. 
These declines primarily reflect higher disconnections of broadband 
bundle customers, as well as fewer cross-selling opportunities.

Ahead of changes to German TV laws, which take effect from July 2024 
and end the practise of bulk TV contracting in Multi Dwelling Units 
(‘MDUs’), we are actively working with our Housing Association partners 
to manage this transition, and sign customers up to individual contracts. 
In total, we have 8.5 million MDU TV customers, and they generate 
around €800 million in basic-TV revenue. We have commenced our first 
trials to re-contract customers.

Mobile service revenue declined by 1.2%* (Q3: -1.7%*, Q4: -3.7%*) 
primarily driven by lower contract ARPU reflecting mobile termination 
rate cuts and a change in customer mix, as well as lower MVNO revenue, 
partially offset by higher roaming revenue. The slowdown in quarterly 
trends was due to small one-off benefits in the prior year, and the impact 
of a major IoT automotive contract renewal in Q4 which will enable us 
to capture additional future revenue opportunities. We added 68,000 
contract customers in the year across both Business and Consumer. 
We also added 8.2 million IoT connections, driven by continued strong 
demand from the automotive sector.

Adjusted EBITDAaL declined by 6.1%*, of which 0.8 percentage points 
was due to higher energy costs. Adjusted EBITDAaL growth was also 
impacted by lower service revenue and one-off settlements in the prior 
year. The adjusted EBITDAaL margin was 2.6* percentage points lower 
year-on-year at 40.6%.

On 8 March 2023 we announced the completion of our fibre-to-the-
home (‘FTTH’) joint venture with Altice, which will deploy FTTH to 
up to seven million homes over a six-year period. This partnership 
is complementary to our upgrade plans for our existing hybrid fibre 
cable network.

Total revenue declined by 6.5% to €3.9 billion due to lower service 
revenue and equipment sales.

On an organic basis, service revenue declined by 5.4%* (Q3: -8.7%*, 
Q4: -3.7%*) driven by continued price competition in the value segment 
and a lower customer base. The improvement in quarterly trends was 
driven by inflation-linked price increases, which took effect at the end 
of January 2023, and increased Business demand for digital services.

In mobile, our contract customer base declined by 159,000 reflecting 
one-off disconnections of 123,000 relating to temporary business SIMs 
provided to schools and higher education providers during the pandemic, 
as well as ongoing price competition in both the Consumer and SoHo 
segments. Our Q4 commercial performance was impacted by our 
price increases. Consumer contract churn improved by 2.7 percentage 
points during the year, supported by our simplified and more transparent 
range of tariff plans. Our second brand ‘Lowi’ continued to grow, adding 
200,000 customers. 

Our broadband customer base declined by 121,000 and our TV customer 
base decreased by 56,000 due to price competition and the ongoing 
shutdown of DSL. Our converged customer base remained broadly 
stable at 2.2 million.

Adjusted EBITDAaL declined by 1.1%*, which included 6.7 percentage 
points of one-off tax benefits and a 1.5 percentage point impact from 
higher energy costs. Excluding these impacts, adjusted EBITDAaL 
declined due to lower service revenue, partly offset by our ongoing 
cost efficiency programme.

On 12 January 2023, we announced that Spain will become part of 
the ‘Europe Cluster’, managed by Serpil Timuray, CEO Europe Cluster. 
In March 2023, we announced that Mário Vaz, previously CEO of 
Vodafone Portugal, had been appointed as new CEO of Spain, effective 
from 1 April 2023.

Total revenue increased by 3.6% to €6.8 billion driven by service 
revenue growth, partly offset by the depreciation of the pound sterling 
against the euro.

On an organic basis, service revenue increased by 5.6%* (Q3: 5.3%*, 
Q4: 3.8%*). This was driven by continued strong growth in Consumer and 
an acceleration in Business. The slowdown in quarterly trends was driven 
by lower MVNO revenues.

Mobile service revenue grew by 8.0%* (Q3: 8.1%*, Q4: 2.8%*), driven 
by our strong commercial momentum and annual price increases 
in Consumer, good growth in Business, and higher roaming revenue. 
The slowdown in quarterly trends reflected the complete migration 
of the Virgin Media MVNO off our network. We continued to deliver good 
customer base growth, supported by our flexible proposition Vodafone 
‘Evo’, adding 230,000 contract customers. Our digital prepaid sub-brand 
‘VOXI’ also continued to grow, with 134,000 customers added in FY23. 
Our digital sales mix improved by 4 percentage points year-on-year 
to 37% of total sales.

Fixed service revenue declined by 0.3%* (Q3: -1.6%*, Q4: 6.3%*) 
with strong growth in Consumer offset by a decline in Business. 
The improvement in quarterly trends was driven by Business, which 
returned to growth in Q4, supported by several large corporate contract 
wins and higher project work. Consumer growth was supported by our 
price actions and good demand for our Vodafone ‘Pro Broadband’ and 
fibre products. Our broadband customer base increased by 173,000 
during the year and we now have over 1.2 million broadband customers. 
Through our partnerships with CityFibre and Openreach we are able to 
reach over 11 million households with full fibre broadband, more than 
any other provider in the UK. 

Adjusted EBITDAaL declined by 1.4%*, of which 5.4 percentage points 
was due to higher energy costs. Adjusted EBITDAaL excluding energy 
grew, driven by service revenue growth, partially offset by other 
inflationary costs, a lower Virgin MVNO contribution and new annual 
licence fees. The adjusted EBITDAaL margin declined 1.3* percentage 
points year-on-year at 19.8%.

On 3 October 2022, we confirmed that we are in discussions with CK 
Hutchison Holdings Limited (‘CK Hutchison’) in relation to a possible 
combination of Vodafone UK and Three UK. The envisaged transaction 
would entail us combining our UK business with Three UK, with Vodafone 
owning 51% and CK Hutchison owning 49% of the combined business. 
There can be no certainty that any transaction will ultimately be agreed.

Total revenue increased by 1.6% to €5.7 billion driven by service revenue 
and equipment sales growth. 

Total revenue increased by 5.4% to €6.3 billion driven by service revenue 
growth and higher equipment sales. 

On an organic basis, service revenue increased by 2.8%* (Q3: 2.1%*, Q4: 
3.6%*), with good growth in all markets other than Romania, which was 
impacted by a mobile termination rate reduction. The improvement in 
quarterly trends was driven by inflation-linked price increases in several 
markets, as well as strong Business growth in Greece.

In Portugal, service revenue grew due to our strong commercial 
momentum, with 183,000 mobile contract customers and 48,000 fixed 
broadband customer additions during the year. In September 2022, 
we announced that we had entered into an agreement to buy Portugal’s 
fourth largest converged operator, Nowo Communications, from Llorca 
JVCO Limited, the owner of Masmovil Ibercom S.A. The transaction 
is conditional on regulatory approval, with completion expected in the 
second half of the 2023 calendar year.

On an organic basis, Vodacom’s service revenue grew by 3.5%* 
(Q3: 3.5%*, Q4: 2.6%*) with growth in both South Africa and Vodacom’s 
international markets. The slowdown in quarterly trends was driven by 
a tough prior year comparative in Vodacom Business within South Africa.

In South Africa, service revenue growth was supported by contract price 
increases and prepaid ARPU growth, partially offset by repricing pressure 
from a government mobile contract renewal. We added 192,000 mobile 
contract customers in the year, and now have a total base of 6.7 million. 
Across our active customer base, 74.9% of our mobile customers now 
use data services, an increase of 2.0 million year-on-year. Financial 
Services revenue grew by 10.6%* to €167 million, supported by good 
demand for insurance services. Our VodaPay ‘super-app’ has continued 
to gain traction with 3.3 million registered users.

In Ireland, service revenue increased driven by customer base growth, 
higher roaming revenue, and contractual price increases. Our mobile 
contract customer base increased by 64,000 and our broadband 
customer base grew by 14,000. In October 2022, we announced that 
we had agreed a fixed wholesale network access agreement with Virgin 
Media Ireland. Vodafone is already the largest fibre-to-the home provider 
in Ireland, covering over 1 million households.

In Vodacom’s international markets, service revenue growth was 
supported by strong growth in data, a higher customer base and strong 
M-Pesa growth. This was despite disruptions caused by heavy flooding 
in both Mozambique and the DRC during the year. M-Pesa revenue grew 
by 15.5% and now represents 25.0% of service revenue. Our mobile 
customer base now stands at 50.2 million with 63.5% of active customers 
using data services.

Service revenue in Greece grew, reflecting higher roaming revenue, good 
growth in Business fixed supported by several public sector contract wins 
relating to the EU Recovery Fund, and higher wholesale revenue. During 
the year we added 138,000 mobile contract customers, and our 
broadband customer base declined by 26,000. 

Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by 4.7%*, including a 3.4 percentage point 
impact from higher energy costs. Excluding this, adjusted EBITDAaL grew 
driven by service revenue growth, ongoing cost efficiencies and a one-off 
provision in Greece last year. The adjusted EBITDAaL margin remained 
stable year-on-year at 28.4%. 

On 31 January 2023, we announced that we had completed the sale 
of Vodafone Hungary to 4iG Public Limited Company and Corvinus Zrt 
for a cash consideration of HUF 660 billion (€1.6 billion), representing 
a multiple of 8.4x Adjusted EBITDAaL for the year ended 31 March 2022.

Vodacom’s adjusted EBITDAaL increased by 1.4%*, including a 1.7 
percentage point impact from higher energy costs. Excluding this, 
adjusted EBITDAaL was supported by service revenue growth and 
accelerated cost initiatives, partially offset by an increase in technology 
operating expenses as we continued to improve the resilience and 
capacity of our network. The adjusted EBITDAaL margin decreased 
by 1.2* percentage points to 34.2%.

On 13 December 2022, Vodafone completed the transfer of its 55% 
shareholding in Vodafone Egypt to Vodacom. This transfer simplifies 
the management of our African assets. Vodafone received cash proceeds 
of €577 million and 242 million shares in Vodacom in exchange for 
Vodafone’s shareholding in Vodafone Egypt. Following completion, 
Vodafone’s shareholding in Vodacom has increased from 60.5% to 65.1%. 
Vodafone Egypt will be included within the Vodacom reporting segment 
from 1 April 2023.

Total revenue remained broadly unchanged at €3.8 billion, with strong 
service revenue growth offset by significant currency devaluations in both 
Turkey and Egypt. 

On an organic basis, service revenue grew by 30.7%* (Q3: 34.1%*, 
Q4: 40.0%) reflecting a higher contribution from Turkey, impacted by 
accelerating inflation, as well a strong customer base and ARPU growth.

Service revenue growth in Turkey was driven by continued customer 
base growth and ongoing repricing actions to reflect the high inflationary 
environment. We maintained our good commercial momentum, adding 
1.6 million mobile contract customers during the year, including 
migrations of prepaid customers. Customer loyalty rates continued to 
improve, with mobile contract churn down by 1.5 percentage points 
year-on-year to 13.9%. Our Q4 performance was impacted by the 
earthquakes in Turkey.

Service revenue in Egypt continued to grow strongly, reflecting good 
customer base growth and increased data usage. During the year, 
we added 153,000 contract customers and 2.5 million prepaid 
mobile customers. 

Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by 22.2%* despite significant inflationary 
pressure on our cost base. The adjusted EBITDAaL margin decreased 
by 3.8* percentage points year-on-year to 29.9%.

On 21 February 2023, Vodafone completed the sale of our 70% 
shareholding in Vodafone Ghana (‘GTCL’) to Telecel Group, further 
simplifying our African portfolio.

Hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey
Turkey was designated as a hyperinflationary economy on 1 April 2022 
in line with IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’. 
See note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ in the condensed consolidated financial 
statements for further information.

During the year service revenue in Turkey increased by 47.6*% and 
adjusted EBITDAaL grew by 49.8%* due to ongoing repricing actions 
to reflect increasing inflation. Organic growth metrics exclude the impact 
of the hyperinflation adjustment in the period in Turkey. Group service 
revenue growth excluding Turkey was 1.0%* (Q3: 0.5%*, Q4: 0.5%*) 
and adjusted EBITDAaL excluding Turkey declined 1.1%*

On 23 March 2023, we announced the completion of our co-control 
partnership for Vantage Towers with a consortium of long-term 
infrastructure investors led by Global Infrastructure Partners and KKR. 
Reflecting the final take-up in the connected voluntary takeover offer 
and delisting offer, the co-control partnership, Oak Holdings GmbH.,

VodafoneZiggo Joint Venture (Netherlands)
The results of VodafoneZiggo, in which we own a 50% stake, are reported 
here under US GAAP, which is broadly consistent with our IFRS basis 
of reporting.

Total revenue remained stable at €4.1 billion, as mobile contract 
customer base growth, higher roaming revenue and contractual price 
increases were offset by a decline in the fixed Consumer customer base. 

During the period, VodafoneZiggo added 181,000 mobile contract 
customers, supported by its best-in-class net promoter score. 
VodafoneZiggo’s broadband customer base declined by 13,000 
customers to 3.3 million due to ongoing price competition. The number 
of converged households increased by 21,000, with 46% of broadband 
customers now converged. VodafoneZiggo now offers nationwide 
1 gigabit speeds across its fixed network.

In FY23, we received €165 million in dividends from the joint venture, 
as well as €51 million in interest payments. 

Safaricom Associate (Kenya)
Safaricom service revenue grew to €2.3 billion due to a higher customer 
base and continued data revenue and M-Pesa growth. In FY23, we 
received €249 million in dividends from Safaricom.

Note:
1.  Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP measure. See page 219 for more information.

The Group’s effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2023 was 
3.8%, (2022: 33.6%). The rate is lower than the prior year’s due to gains 
on the disposals of Vantage Towers and Vodafone Ghana. These gains 
are largely exempt from tax, except for a €88 million charge relating to 
the disposal of Vantage Towers. 

The effective tax rate also includes a tax credit of €309m relating to the 
impacts of hyperinflation accounting in Turkey and a €33 million tax 
charge (2022: €327 million) relating to the use of losses in Luxembourg, 
which is lower than the prior period because of an internal restructuring 
which resulted in a loss in Luxembourg. As a result of the restructuring, 
the amount of losses in Luxembourg are no longer subject to changes 
in the value of investments.

The year ended 31 March 2022 includes the following items: i) a charge 
of €1,468 million for the utilisation of losses against our profits in 
Luxembourg. This arose from an increase in the valuation of investments 
based upon local GAAP financial statements and tax returns; ii) a credit 
of €699 million relating to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 
Luxembourg because of higher interest rates increasing our forecasts of 
future profits; iii) an increase in our deferred tax assets in the UK of €593 
million following the increase in the corporate tax rate to 25% and; iv) 
€273 million following the revaluation of assets for tax purposes in Italy.

The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2023 
was 26.2% (2022: 27.9%). This is in line with our expectations for the year.

The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the amounts relating to 
Luxembourg, the impact of hyperinflation accounting in Turkey and 
the tax charge relating to the disposal of Vantage Towers which are 
set out above.

Consolidated statement of financial position
The consolidated statement of financial position is set out on page 124. 
Details of the major movements of both our assets and liabilities in the 
year are set out below.

Assets
Goodwill decreased by €4.3 billion between 31 March 2022 and 31 
March 2023 to €27.6 billion. This was primarily attributable to a decrease 
of €3.9 billion from the disposal of subsidiaries in the year (see note 27 
‘Acquisitions and disposals’ in the consolidated financial statements) and 
a net decrease of €0.4 billion from foreign exchange movements. 

Other intangible assets, which primarily comprises licence and 
spectrum, computer software and customer bases, decreased by 
€1.8 billion between 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023 to €19.6 billion. 
This reflected an amortisation charge of €4.0 billion, a reduction from the 
disposal of subsidiaries of €0.8 billion and a net decrease from exchange 
movements of €0.6 billion, partly offset by additions of €3.3 billion in the 
year and an increase of €0.5 billion following the adoption of IAS 29 
‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’ (see note 1 ‘Basis 
of preparation’ in the consolidated financial statements’). 

Property, plant and equipment decreased by €2.8 billion between 
31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023 to €38.0 billion. This primarily 
reflected additions in the year of €5.9 billion and an increase of €0.7 
billion following the adoption of IAS 29 (see above), which was offset 
by a depreciation charge of €5.6 billion, a reduction of €2.7 billion arising 
from the disposal of subsidiaries in the year and a net decrease of €1.0 
billion from foreign exchange movements. Right-of-use assets arising 
from the Group’s lease arrangements remain broadly consistent with 
the prior year with the recognition of lease arrangements on the 
de-consolidation of Vantage Towers A.G. offsetting disposals. 

Other non-current assets increased by €7.2 billion between 31 March 
2022 and 31 March 2023 to €39.7 billion, primarily due to a €5.8 billion 
increase in investments in associates and joint ventures which now 
includes Oak Holdings 1 GmbH, the new co-control partnership of 
Vodafone, GIP and KKR (see note 12 ‘Investments in associates and joint 
arrangements’ in the consolidated financial statements). In addition, 
trade and other receivables increased by €1.5 billion primarily due to 
an increase in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments. 

Current assets increased by €3.1 billion between 31 March 2022 and 
31 March 2023 to €30.7 billion, primarily due to an increase of €4.2 billion 
in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a €0.9 billion decrease 
in other investments.

1.  The results for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that Indus 

Towers Limited is no longer reported as held for sale. Consequently, basic earnings per share 

increased by 0.51c, from 7.20c as previously reported, to 7.71c. Adjusted basic earnings 

per share increased by 0.65c, from 11.03c as previously reported, to 11.68c. See note 7 

’Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ in the consolidated financial statements 

for more information.

2.  Adjusted basic earnings per share is a non-GAAP measure. See page 219 for more information.

Basic earnings per share was 42.77 eurocents, compared to 7.71 

eurocents for FY22. The increase is primarily attributable to the gains 

on disposal of Vantage Towers A.G. and Vodafone Ghana, partially offset 

by the loss on disposal of Vodafone Hungary.

Adjusted basic earnings per share was 11.45 eurocents, compared to 

11.68 eurocents for FY22.

1.  Adjusted net financing costs is a non-GAAP measure. See page 219 for more information.

Net financing costs decreased by €230 million, primarily due to 

mark-to-market gains recycled from reserves on derivatives that were 

previously in cash flow hedge relationships and mark-to-market gains 

on embedded derivatives. Adjusted net financing costs increased by 

€197 million primarily due to interest movements on lease liabilities and 

tax provisions and other individually immaterial movements. Excluding 

items outside of net debt, net financing costs remained broadly stable.

1.  Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP measure. See page 219 for more information.

The Group’s effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2023 was 

3.8%, (2022: 33.6%). The rate is lower than the prior year’s due to gains 

on the disposals of Vantage Towers and Vodafone Ghana. These gains 

are largely exempt from tax, except for a €88 million charge relating to 

the disposal of Vantage Towers. 

The effective tax rate also includes a tax credit of €309m relating to the 

impacts of hyperinflation accounting in Turkey and a €33 million tax 

charge (2022: €327 million) relating to the use of losses in Luxembourg, 

which is lower than the prior period because of an internal restructuring 

which resulted in a loss in Luxembourg. As a result of the restructuring, 

the amount of losses in Luxembourg are no longer subject to changes 

in the value of investments.

of €1,468 million for the utilisation of losses against our profits in 

Luxembourg. This arose from an increase in the valuation of investments 

based upon local GAAP financial statements and tax returns; ii) a credit 

of €699 million relating to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 

Luxembourg because of higher interest rates increasing our forecasts of 

future profits; iii) an increase in our deferred tax assets in the UK of €593 

million following the increase in the corporate tax rate to 25% and; iv) 

€273 million following the revaluation of assets for tax purposes in Italy.

The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2023 

was 26.2% (2022: 27.9%). This is in line with our expectations for the year.

The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the amounts relating to 

Luxembourg, the impact of hyperinflation accounting in Turkey and 

the tax charge relating to the disposal of Vantage Towers which are 

set out above.

Consolidated statement of financial position

The consolidated statement of financial position is set out on page 124. 

Details of the major movements of both our assets and liabilities in the 

year are set out below.

Assets

Goodwill decreased by €4.3 billion between 31 March 2022 and 31 

March 2023 to €27.6 billion. This was primarily attributable to a decrease 

of €3.9 billion from the disposal of subsidiaries in the year (see note 27 

‘Acquisitions and disposals’ in the consolidated financial statements) and 

a net decrease of €0.4 billion from foreign exchange movements. 

Other intangible assets, which primarily comprises licence and 

spectrum, computer software and customer bases, decreased by 

€1.8 billion between 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023 to €19.6 billion. 

This reflected an amortisation charge of €4.0 billion, a reduction from the 

disposal of subsidiaries of €0.8 billion and a net decrease from exchange 

movements of €0.6 billion, partly offset by additions of €3.3 billion in the 

year and an increase of €0.5 billion following the adoption of IAS 29 

‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’ (see note 1 ‘Basis 

of preparation’ in the consolidated financial statements’). 

Property, plant and equipment decreased by €2.8 billion between 

31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023 to €38.0 billion. This primarily 

reflected additions in the year of €5.9 billion and an increase of €0.7 

billion following the adoption of IAS 29 (see above), which was offset 

by a depreciation charge of €5.6 billion, a reduction of €2.7 billion arising 

from the disposal of subsidiaries in the year and a net decrease of €1.0 

billion from foreign exchange movements. Right-of-use assets arising 

from the Group’s lease arrangements remain broadly consistent with 

the prior year with the recognition of lease arrangements on the 

Other non-current assets increased by €7.2 billion between 31 March 

2022 and 31 March 2023 to €39.7 billion, primarily due to a €5.8 billion 

increase in investments in associates and joint ventures which now 

includes Oak Holdings 1 GmbH, the new co-control partnership of 

Vodafone, GIP and KKR (see note 12 ‘Investments in associates and joint 

arrangements’ in the consolidated financial statements). In addition, 

trade and other receivables increased by €1.5 billion primarily due to 

an increase in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments. 

Current assets increased by €3.1 billion between 31 March 2022 and 

31 March 2023 to €30.7 billion, primarily due to an increase of €4.2 billion 

in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a €0.9 billion decrease 

in other investments.

The year ended 31 March 2022 includes the following items: i) a charge 

de-consolidation of Vantage Towers A.G. offsetting disposals. 

Total equity and liabilities
Total equity increased by €7.4 billion between 31 March 2022 and 31 
March 2023 to €64.5 billion, primarily due to comprehensive income for 
the year of €11.6 billion and an opening adjustment of €0.6 billion for the 
adoption of IAS 29. This was partially offset by a decrease of €1.4 billion 
arising from transactions with non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, 
dividends paid to the Group’s shareholders of €2.9 billion and the 
purchase of treasury shares of €0.6 billion.

Non-current liabilities decreased by €6.9 billion between 31 March 2022 
and 31 March 2023 to €56.5 billion, primarily due to a €6.5 billion decrease 
in borrowings and a €0.3 billion decrease in trade and other payables. 

Current liabilities increased by €1.0 billion between 31 March 2022 and 
31 March 2023 to €34.6 billion, primarily due to a €2.8 billion increase in 
borrowings, offset by a €1.4 billion decrease in trade and other payables 
as a result of settling the share buyback obligation from the prior year. 

Inflation
The impact of inflation on the Group’s operations during the year is 
outlined on pages 18 to 21. Furthermore, Turkey has met the requirements 
to be designated as a hyperinflationary economy on 1 April 2022 in 
line with IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’. 
See note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ in the consolidated financial statements 
for more information.

Cash inflow from operating activities decreased to €18,054 million, as 
favourable working capital movements were offset by lower operating 
profit, excluding a net gain resulting from the sale of Vantage Towers, 
Vodafone Ghana and Vodafone Hungary, and higher taxation payments. 

Outflow from investing activities decreased to €379 million, primarily in 
relation to proceeds resulting from the disposals of Vantage Towers and 
Vodafone Hungary, which outweighed a lower net inflow in respect of 
short-term investments. Short-term investments include highly liquid 
government and government-backed securities and managed 
investment funds that are in highly rated and liquid money market 
investments with liquidity of up to 90 days.

Outflows from financing activities increased by 38.4% to €13,430 million, 
as higher outflows arising from the repayment of borrowings, including 
the repayment of debt in relation to licenses and spectrum, notably in Italy, 
outweighed higher proceeds from the issue of long-term borrowings.

Integration capital additions comprises amounts for the integration of acquired Liberty Global 
assets and network integration.
Includes working capital in respect of Integration capital additions. 
Interest received and paid excludes interest on lease liabilities of €372 million outflow (FY22: 
€361 million) included within Adjusted EBITDAaL and €26 million of cash outflow (FY22: €58 
million inflow) from the option structures relating to the issue of the mandatory convertible 
bonds which is included within Share buybacks. The option structures were intended to ensure 
that the total cash outflow to execute the programme were broadly equivalent to the amounts 
raised on issuing each tranche.

6.  Other movements on net debt for the year ended 31 March 2023 includes mark-to-market 

gains recognised in the income statement of €534 million (FY22: €256 million gain), together 
with €1,739 million (FY22: €55 million) for the repayment of debt in relation to licenses and 
spectrum in Italy.

7.  Other adjustments in FY23 includes €120 million received in respect of the Group’s new fibre 

joint venture in Germany and an allocation of €43 million from the Vodafone Hungary proceeds 
for future services to be provided by the Group. The amount for FY22 includes a special 
dividend of €194 million paid to the minority shareholders in Egypt.

Adjusted free cash flow decreased by €595 million to €4,842 million 
in the year. This reflected a decrease in Adjusted EBITDAaL in the year, 
together with higher payments on lease liabilities, which outweighed 
favourable working capital movements and higher taxation payments.

cash collateral liabilities €4,886 million (FY22: €2,914 million). 

The decrease in borrowings of €3,702 million was principally driven 
by repayments of bonds of €5,742 million, Italy licences and spectrum 
liabilities of €1,739 million and the disposal of our controlling interest 
in Vantage Towers of €2,188 million, partially offset by bonds issued

Notes:
1.  Gross debt and Net debt are non-GAAP measures. See page 219 for more information.
2.  Short-term investments includes €1,338 million (FY22: €1,446 million) of highly liquid 

government and government-backed securities and managed investment funds of €2,967 
million (FY22: €3,349 million) that are in highly rated and liquid money market investments 
with liquidity of up to 90 days.

3.  Derivative financial instruments excludes derivative movements in cash flow hedging reserves 

of €2,785 million gain (FY22: €1,350 million gain).

4.  Collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments result in cash being held as security. 

This is repayable when derivatives are settled and is therefore deducted from liquidity.

Net debt decreased by €8,203 million to €33,375 million. This was driven 
by the free cash inflow of €1,442 million and acquisitions and disposals 
of €8,727 million, partially offset by equity dividends of €2,484 million, 
share buybacks of €1,893 million (used to offset dilution linked to the 
conversion of certain mandatory convertible bonds). Other movements 
in net debt includes €1,730 million relating to the settlement of 5G 
spectrum in Italy previously included in net debt. Settlement of the 
liability during the period had no impact overall on net debt, with the 
resulting cash payment included in free cash flow. 

Other funding obligations to be considered alongside net debt include:

 – Lease liabilities of €13,364 million (€12,539 million as at 

31 March 2022);

 – KDG put option liabilities of €485 million (€494 million as at 

31 March 2022);

 – Guarantee over Australia joint venture loan of €1,611 million 

(€1,573 million as at 31 March 2022); and

 – Pension liabilities of €258 million (€281 million as at 31 March 2022).

The Group’s gross and net debt includes €9,942 million (€9,942 million 
as at 31 March 2022) of long-term borrowings (‘Hybrid bonds’) for which a 
50% equity characteristic of €4,971 million (€4,971 million as at 31 March 
2022) is attributed by credit rating agencies.

The Group’s gross and net debt includes certain bonds which have been 
designated in hedge relationships, which are carried at €1,282 million 
higher value (€1,316 million higher as at 31 March 2022) than their euro 
equivalent redemption value. In addition, where bonds are issued in 
currencies other than euro, the Group has entered into foreign currency 
swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption. The impact of these 
swaps is not reflected in gross debt and if it were included would 
decrease the euro equivalent value of the bonds by €1,440 million 
(€1,456 million as at 31 March 2022).

Return on capital employed
Return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) reflects how efficiently we are 
generating profit with the capital we deploy. We calculate two ROCE 
measures: i) Pre-tax ROCE for controlled operations only and ii) Post-tax 
ROCE including associates and joint ventures. ROCE calculated using 
GAAP measures3 for the year was 12.9% (FY22: 5.2%), impacted by the 
disposal of Vantage Towers to the newly formed joint venture, resulting 
in an increase in the average capital employed.

Notes:
1.  The results for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that Indus 

Towers Limited is no longer reported as held for sale. Consequently, post-tax ROCE (controlled 
and associates/joint ventures) has increased by 0.2pps, from 5.0% as previously reported, to 
5.2%. Similarly, ROCE calculated using GAAP measures has increased by 0.2pps, from 5.0% 
as previously reported, to 5.2%. See note 7 ’Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ 
in the consolidated financial statements for more information.

2.  FY23 excludes the results of Vantage Towers following its disposal on 22 March 2023. FY22 

excluding Vantage Towers pre-tax ROCE is 7.0% and post-tax ROCE is 5.0%. 

3.  ROCE is calculated by dividing Operating profit by the average of capital employed as 

reported in the consolidated statement of financial position. Pre-tax ROCE (controlled) and 
Post-tax ROCE (controlled and associates/joint ventures) are non-GAAP measures. See page 
219 for more information.

disposal of Vantage Towers to the newly formed joint venture, resulting 

in an increase in the average capital employed.

1.  Gross debt and Net debt are non-GAAP measures. See page 219 for more information.

2.  Short-term investments includes €1,338 million (FY22: €1,446 million) of highly liquid 

government and government-backed securities and managed investment funds of €2,967 

million (FY22: €3,349 million) that are in highly rated and liquid money market investments 

with liquidity of up to 90 days.

3.  Derivative financial instruments excludes derivative movements in cash flow hedging reserves 

of €2,785 million gain (FY22: €1,350 million gain).

4.  Collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments result in cash being held as security. 

1.  The results for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that Indus 

This is repayable when derivatives are settled and is therefore deducted from liquidity.

Net debt decreased by €8,203 million to €33,375 million. This was driven 

by the free cash inflow of €1,442 million and acquisitions and disposals 

of €8,727 million, partially offset by equity dividends of €2,484 million, 

share buybacks of €1,893 million (used to offset dilution linked to the 

conversion of certain mandatory convertible bonds). Other movements 

in net debt includes €1,730 million relating to the settlement of 5G 

spectrum in Italy previously included in net debt. Settlement of the 

liability during the period had no impact overall on net debt, with the 

resulting cash payment included in free cash flow. 

Towers Limited is no longer reported as held for sale. Consequently, post-tax ROCE (controlled 

and associates/joint ventures) has increased by 0.2pps, from 5.0% as previously reported, to 

5.2%. Similarly, ROCE calculated using GAAP measures has increased by 0.2pps, from 5.0% 

as previously reported, to 5.2%. See note 7 ’Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ 

in the consolidated financial statements for more information.

2.  FY23 excludes the results of Vantage Towers following its disposal on 22 March 2023. FY22 

excluding Vantage Towers pre-tax ROCE is 7.0% and post-tax ROCE is 5.0%. 

3.  ROCE is calculated by dividing Operating profit by the average of capital employed as 

reported in the consolidated statement of financial position. Pre-tax ROCE (controlled) and 

Post-tax ROCE (controlled and associates/joint ventures) are non-GAAP measures. See page 

219 for more information.

Share buybacks
In March 2022, Vodafone started the first of two irrevocable and 
non-discretionary share buyback programmes, announced on 9 March 
2022 and 16 November 2022 (the ‘programmes’), The sole purpose of 
the programmes was to reduce the issued share capital of Vodafone to 
offset the increase in the issued share capital as a result of the maturing 
of the second tranche of the mandatory convertible bond (‘MCB’) 
in March 2022.

In order to satisfy the second tranche of the MCB, a total of 1,518.6 
million shares were reissued from treasury shares in March 2022 at 
a conversion price of £1.326. This reflected the conversion price at 
issue (£1.3505) adjusted for the pound sterling equivalent of aggregate 
dividends paid in August 2019, February 2020, August 2020, February 
2021, August 2021 and February 2022.

The programmes completed on 15 March 2023. Details of the shares 
purchased under the programmes, including those purchased under 
irrevocable instructions, are shown below.

Our purpose
Our purpose is to connect for a better future by using 
technology to improve lives and enable inclusive

by focusing on three pillars: Digital Society, Inclusion 
for All and Planet, which serve as the framework

practices: protecting data, protecting people,  
and business integrity.

Our three purpose pillars are focused on integrating environmental and

The role of business in society continues to evolve to address the 
socioeconomic impacts triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and 
humanitarian and refugee crises caused by natural catastrophes and 
conflicts, as well as the ongoing climate crisis. Recognising this, we 
continue to evolve our social contract, which represents the partnership 
we wish to develop with governments, policy makers and civil society. 
We use the social contract to understand what matters the most to the 
societies and economies we operate in, and activate our purpose around 
these. This year we transitioned our social contract to address societal 
challenges created by the significant rise in the costs of living affecting 
many of our customers, as well as providing humanitarian support 
relating to the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the earthquakes in Turkey 
and surrounding areas in February 2023.

How we are keeping everyone connected through 
the cost of living crisis
In today’s world, connectivity is an essential service; it underpins access to 
information, provision of services, and the ability to connect personally and 
professionally. However, as the cost of living increases, affording to stay 
connected is increasingly difficult for both individuals and businesses. 
To support our customers through this financially challenging time we offer 
low cost and social tariffs in all our markets. Whenever we can, we use 
government criteria for eligibility to ensure we implement social tariffs as 
fairly as possible, and we do not apply price increases to social tariffs at any 
point during the term of the contract. We also support customers who find 
themselves in financial difficulties fairly and appropriately, ensuring they get 
the right help, support, and services for their needs, including revised 
payment plans or other options. We seek to monitor the impact of our help 
for customers struggling to pay, listen to their feedback and improve our 
services as a result. We continue to work with governments, consult with 
consumer organisations and partner with providers to help raise awareness 
of the support available.

Everyone connected
Since its launch in June 2021, our everyone.connected programme has 
delivered £108 million in social value across the UK. Following the launch 
of our social broadband tariff Vodafone Essential Broadband, we are the 
first UK network operator to have both a social mobile and a fixed tariff 
alongside a social virtual network offering (VOXI for Now). We also 
reached the milestone of donating connectivity to one million people, 
and we have since committed to helping a further three million people 
cross the digital divide (the gap between those with access to the internet 
and those without it) by the end of 2025.

For small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs’) and small-office 
home-office (‘SOHO’) customers, we provide our V-Hub service, a digital 
advisory service offering free information, inspiration and insight to 
increase understanding, and benefits of digital tools and technology. 
V-Hub users also get access to an adviser who provides one-to-one 
tailored support and guidance.

Vodafone’s humanitarian response in support 
of Turkey and surrounding areas
The earthquakes in Turkey and surrounding areas created an 
unprecedented humanitarian crisis impacting more than 13 million 
people in the region across an area of 110,000 square kilometres. 
Around 32,000 people lost their lives, including 27 Vodafone 
employees. The Vodafone Turkey Search & Rescue Team, formed 
voluntarily by Vodafone employees, worked tirelessly to assist the 
emergency response in the disaster zone and support customers, 
communities and society in the aftermath of the quakes.

Restoring connectivity
Vodafone has more than 3.7 million customers across 10 cities in the 
affected area in Turkey connected through more than 3,000 mobile 
base stations, most of which were destroyed or damaged during 
the earthquakes.

We focused on restoring and keeping our networks operational, 
ensuring that our customers and their communities could be 
connected. Vodafone Turkey immediately mobilised engineering teams 
and over 1,000 power generators to work 24 hours a day to restore 
connectivity. As a result, Vodafone Turkey had restored almost 98% 
of its network coverage in the affected areas just days after the disaster.

Supporting our employees
Vodafone offered financial support for our employees and agents 
living in the affected areas. In some cases, our offices were repurposed 
in order to provide shelter and accommodation for people and 
their families.

Keeping our customers connected
In Turkey, Vodafone provided free calls, data, and texts to people in 
the impacted areas of the country. Many of our markets also provided 
their customers with free calls and texts into Turkey and Syria, or free 
roaming services when visiting the region so that people could keep 
connected with their families and friends.

Charitable and fundraising activities
The humanitarian part of our initial comprehensive response is 
coordinated under Vodafone Foundation in line with our policy for  
all charitable activities to be led and funnelled by our Foundations.

A donation fund was established across Vodafone and its Foundation 
that has to date raised more than €3 million to be used for rescue and 
recovery initiatives in Turkey.

fairly as possible, and we do not apply price increases to social tariffs at any 

point during the term of the contract. We also support customers who find 

themselves in financial difficulties fairly and appropriately, ensuring they get 

the right help, support, and services for their needs, including revised 

payment plans or other options. We seek to monitor the impact of our help 

for customers struggling to pay, listen to their feedback and improve our 

services as a result. We continue to work with governments, consult with 

consumer organisations and partner with providers to help raise awareness 

of the support available.

Everyone connected

Since its launch in June 2021, our everyone.connected programme has 

delivered £108 million in social value across the UK. Following the launch 

of our social broadband tariff Vodafone Essential Broadband, we are the 

first UK network operator to have both a social mobile and a fixed tariff 

alongside a social virtual network offering (VOXI for Now). We also 

reached the milestone of donating connectivity to one million people, 

and we have since committed to helping a further three million people 

cross the digital divide (the gap between those with access to the internet 

and those without it) by the end of 2025.

For small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs’) and small-office 

home-office (‘SOHO’) customers, we provide our V-Hub service, a digital 

advisory service offering free information, inspiration and insight to 

increase understanding, and benefits of digital tools and technology. 

V-Hub users also get access to an adviser who provides one-to-one 

tailored support and guidance.

Vodafone’s humanitarian response in support 

of Turkey and surrounding areas

The earthquakes in Turkey and surrounding areas created an 

unprecedented humanitarian crisis impacting more than 13 million 

people in the region across an area of 110,000 square kilometres. 

Around 32,000 people lost their lives, including 27 Vodafone 

employees. The Vodafone Turkey Search & Rescue Team, formed 

voluntarily by Vodafone employees, worked tirelessly to assist the 

emergency response in the disaster zone and support customers, 

communities and society in the aftermath of the quakes.

Restoring connectivity

Vodafone has more than 3.7 million customers across 10 cities in the 

affected area in Turkey connected through more than 3,000 mobile 

base stations, most of which were destroyed or damaged during 

the earthquakes.

We focused on restoring and keeping our networks operational, 

ensuring that our customers and their communities could be 

connected. Vodafone Turkey immediately mobilised engineering teams 

and over 1,000 power generators to work 24 hours a day to restore 

connectivity. As a result, Vodafone Turkey had restored almost 98% 

of its network coverage in the affected areas just days after the disaster.

Supporting our employees

Vodafone offered financial support for our employees and agents 

living in the affected areas. In some cases, our offices were repurposed 

in order to provide shelter and accommodation for people and 

their families.

Keeping our customers connected

In Turkey, Vodafone provided free calls, data, and texts to people in 

the impacted areas of the country. Many of our markets also provided 

their customers with free calls and texts into Turkey and Syria, or free 

roaming services when visiting the region so that people could keep 

connected with their families and friends.

Charitable and fundraising activities

The humanitarian part of our initial comprehensive response is 

coordinated under Vodafone Foundation in line with our policy for  

all charitable activities to be led and funnelled by our Foundations.

A donation fund was established across Vodafone and its Foundation 

that has to date raised more than €3 million to be used for rescue and 

recovery initiatives in Turkey.

Digital Society
We believe in the power of connectivity and digital 
services to strengthen the resilience of societies. Our 
priority is to provide fixed networks to ensure that data 
flows at speed to connect people and communities. 
In doing so, we can contribute to societies becoming 
more inclusive, under our Inclusion for All pillar, and to 
decarbonising our economies, under our Planet pillar.

As recent years have demonstrated, connectivity and digital services can  
be a lifeline, allowing people to work, learn, access healthcare, stay in touch 
with friends and family and more. Currently, we have over 300 million 
customers connected to our next-generation mobile and fixed networks.

Informed by our social contract, we continue to focus the Digital Society  
pillar towards digitalising critical sectors. We have specifically focused on 
small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs’), agriculture and health. We  
have also continued to invest in our network infrastructure and coverage.

Aligned with our Planet pillar, our products and services enable customers  
to become more efficient and, in many cases, reduce their emissions, 
through the use of such products and services.

Digitalising business
Goal: Support seven million visitors to digitalise using V-Hub by 2025

SMEs are the lifeblood of our economy, providing opportunities for 
socio-economic participation, as well as social mobility for women, young 
people, and ethnic minorities.

Through Vodafone Business, we provide products and services which 
are specifically tailored for SME and small-office home-office (‘SOHO’) 
businesses, helping guide them through technology choices and 
improving their digital readiness. These segments also represent a 
significant commercial opportunity for Vodafone. We estimate that the 
total addressable market for SME and SOHO customers in our markets 
is €55 billion and we currently have almost seven million SME and 
SOHO customers.

To better support SMEs across Europe and Africa, Vodafone Business 
launched V-Hub, its digital advice service. This free service provides access 
to online information and connects SMEs with experts who provide 
one-to-one advice and support on digitally transforming businesses in 
an ever-changing digital world.

As of March 2023, V-Hub has been used by over 5.2 million unique visitors 
across 14 markets. Since its launch, the service has achieved a strong 
return rate of 25% on average, increasing to almost 30% in Q3 and 35% 
in Q4 of FY23.

We have set an ambition to reach seven million visitors and help them digitalise 
their businesses through V-Hub by 2025. Over the next year, we plan to 
enhance the V-Hub offering, creating a signed-in environment to provide a 
more personal, secure, and efficient experience for SMEs. Once signed in, 
users will receive tailored content and a bespoke action plan for their business’ 
digitalisation. In turn, we will start to build a V-Hub membership of engaged 
SMEs on their digitalisation journey, creating reliable and relevant connections 
for peer-to-peer advice, business networking and local-to-global community.

Beyond customers, we are working to support SMEs in our supply chain. 
We also offer optional supply chain financing which allows suppliers 
to leverage Vodafone’s credit position to access cheaper funding and 
liquidity. This has no impact on Vodafone’s commercially negotiated 
payment terms.

In South Africa, Vodacom Financial Services has built a supplier portal 
called VodaTrade, where small suppliers can connect with bigger business 
partners. Currently, there are 127 SMEs registered on the VodaTrade 
portal, which provides them access to procurement opportunities with 
seven large retailers.

Digitalising agriculture
According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation, by 2050, the 
world will need to produce 50% more food than current levels.1 There is 
also a growing need to address the environmental impact of agriculture. 
In Europe, agriculture accounts for 10% of total greenhouse gas 
emissions and over 40% of land use,2 in many cases leading to habitat 
loss and deforestation.

A total of five million farmers are registered on our various agriculture 
platforms that manage and monitor resource consumption, which in turn 
can reduce their carbon footprint, protect biodiversity, and increase yields.

Vodafone is working with partners across the value chain to introduce 
new applications and Internet of Things (‘IoT’) platforms to provide 
farmers with digital information and the opportunity to optimise resources. 
Through Vodacom’s subsidiary, Mezzanine, we have developed 
MyFarmWeb, an agricultural digital platform, to support commercial 
farms. Last year we expanded into Italy, Germany, Spain, Ireland and 
the UK and now almost 9,300 commercial farms use MyFarmWeb.

The cloud-based web platform allows producers to capture key 
agriculture data (physical, chemical, microbial soil analysis, pest presence, 
and satellite and sensor) into a system that aggregates and calibrates the 
information to assist decision-making. This equips decision-makers with 
information to increase yields whilst not damaging the environment 
– all of which could enable carbon savings along the production process. 
MyFarmWeb also provides farmers with a platform that aims to allow 
them to use more productive and sustainable farming practices, which is 
becoming increasingly important to comply with the changing legislation 
to qualify for subsidy funding in the future.

Mezzanine is also helping to digitalise agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa 
through its eVuna and dairy management platforms amongst others. 
This enables smallholder farmers to access agricultural inputs, financial 
products, logistics suppliers, markets, and knowledge.

Mezzanine’s eVoucher platform enables the distribution of digital 
vouchers for farming subsidies with over 4.6 million registered farmers 
and enables the distribution of disaster relief grants. We continue to 
support the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural 
Development and the Solidarity Fund in South Africa, as well as the 
Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Fisheries and the Kenyan 
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. These programmes have issued 
over two million vouchers to smallholder farmers.

Women and youth were focus demographics for some of the 
programmes, with the Solidarity Fund reporting that more than 69% 
of the beneficiaries were women. Over nine million vouchers have been 
issued through various disaster relief programmes.

Digitalising healthcare
Recent years have seen several global events impact the mental and 
physical health of citizens, as well as causing major disruptions to health 
systems around the world. Hospital waiting lists are extending, some 
healthcare professionals are leaving the industry and delays in diagnoses 
are resulting in patients presenting significantly advanced medical issues.1

As part of the EU’s focus on building resilient health systems, over €40 
billion has been set aside in EU Recovery and Resilience Plans to support 
health investments and reforms.1 A recent survey by the Vodafone 
Institute revealed that 92% of European citizens think the health sector 
needs urgent support.2

We aim to use our technology to play an active role and make the 
delivery of healthcare services more efficient and cost-effective for 
providers, and more inclusive for patients. Examples of how we are 
making a difference include:

 – Working together with University Clinic Düsseldorf, we have built 
Europe’s first 5G medical campus using Vodafone’s RedBox, a 5G 
network-in-a-box that provides multi-building low latency coverage. 
The 5G network enables new ways of working for medical 
professionals – for example, using 3D mixed reality to rehearse 
neurology and cardiology procedures before operating.

 – Vodafone will implement optical fibre backbone and internet access 
for thousands of hospitals and health centres across seven regions 
in Italy. This is part of the Italian government’s National Recovery and 
Resilience Plan as it looks to improve connectivity infrastructure across 
the healthcare system.

 – In Spain, we have helped Cruz Roja Español (Red Cross) by building 
a telecare solution that supports vulnerable people, including the 
elderly, victims of gender violence and people with disabilities.

 – We are among the largest global IoT connectivity providers, enabling 

over 25 million connected medical devices on our IoT network, 
and have been recognised by Gartner as a leader in Managed IoT 
Connectivity Services for nine consecutive years.

 – Health is the foundation upon which resilient, productive and fair 
societies are built and, as we look to the future, we are investing in 
our new Tech Innovation Centre in Dresden. Working with leading 
universities, hospitals, and health tech companies, we’re advancing 
the use of 5G, 6G and artificial intelligence (‘AI’) in digital healthcare. 

Inclusion for All
Our Inclusion for All strategy seeks to ensure no 
one is left behind. It focuses on digital skills and 
improving equitable access to connectivity, and 
on offering products and services that facilitate 
access to education, healthcare, and finance for 
marginalised and vulnerable groups. At Vodafone, 
we aim to develop a diverse and inclusive global 
workforce that reflects the customers and 
societies we serve.

In 2022, as the global population hit eight billion, 5.3 billion of us were 
online, while 2.7 billion remained offline, representing a stubborn digital 
divide. In Africa, 60% of the population is unconnected, and in the world’s 
least developed countries the figure rises to 64%. Globally, the growth 
rate for internet usage was 6.1%,1 which is well below growth 
requirements to achieve the UN’s target of universal and meaningful 
connectivity by the end of 2023. This target is further threatened by high 
inflation and the cost of living crisis, which has eroded real incomes and 
pushed millions more into poverty in Europe and Africa.

The internet is a vital part of everyday life, enabling us to communicate, 
and access vital services. There are strong economic gains from increased 
usage of mobile broadband. Research from the World Bank shows that 
mobile broadband can reduce the number of households in extreme 
poverty by 4 percentage points, mainly due to increases in labour force 
participation among women.2 Furthermore, expanding broadband 
penetration across Africa by 10% could boost GDP per capita by 2.5%.2

Access for all and propositions for equality pillars within our overall 
Inclusion for All strategy focus on overcoming the five key barriers that 
create the digital divide; coverage, access to devices, affordability, digital 
skills, and creating relevant products and services for those most at risk 
of being unconnected, such as the elderly and women. In FY23, we made 
significant progress across these areas and continued to build on the 
partnerships that are crucial to achieving meaningful connectivity for all.

Access for all
Increasing coverage
Connecting everyone to digital services, particularly across Africa, is a 
significant challenge. Fixed and mobile services are increasing globally, 
with mobile broadband networks reaching 95% of the world’s population, 
but coverage in Africa lags behind at 83%.3

Expanding coverage to rural networks remains a focus for us, with 25% of 
the EU population and 58% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa living 
in rural areas.4 Expansion of rural networks can often be more challenging 
and have a lower return on investment due to lower population densities. 
New approaches, partnerships, and a blend of technologies help us to 
overcome some of these barriers and deliver more universal coverage.

One example of such new approaches is our partnership with AST 
& Science LLC, which seeks to develop the first space-based mobile 
network designed to connect directly to consumers’ 4G and 5G devices 
without the need for specialised hardware. This year, AST successfully 
launched and deployed its first communications array and announced in 
April 2023 the first connection from space to a mobile with no specialised 
equipment. The space-based network has the potential to enable even 
those in the hardest-to-reach areas to connect to the internet, ultimately 
reaching an estimated 1.6 billion people across 49 countries. This will 
include a number of least-developed countries where coverage 
is currently the lowest.

In order to drive digital inclusion to the hardest-to-connect communities, 
this year we made good progress on our goal to increase 4G population 
coverage to an additional 80 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa 
(as part of the UN Partner2Connect digital coalition since March 2022). 
This targeted intervention includes four of the least-developed counties 
(‘LDCs’): Mozambique, Tanzania, Lesotho and the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo (‘DRC’), and will help to close a particular gap in internet 
usage between urban communities and rural communities. This year 
we have added 4G technology to an additional 1,429 sites across these 
countries, giving access to millions more people in Sub-Saharan Africa.

In Europe, as well as in Africa, we are also increasing investment in rural 
areas, helping farmers and other rural small businesses overcome barriers 
to connectivity and digitisation.

In line with the recommendation to increase device financing options, 
Vodacom launched the Easy2Own payment plan during the year. 
Through the initiative, customers in South Africa can purchase a 
smartphone with a one-off deposit and complete the payment through 
affordable monthly payments over the following 11 months. Customers 
who settle their monthly instalment on time receive a 1GB data bundle, 
valid for seven days each month. 

Safaricom also runs a device-financing programme, Lipa Mdogo Mdogo 
(Pay Little by Little). The partnership between Safaricom and Google 
offers a flexible payment plan with an 95% reduction in the upfront cost 
of 500Ksh and an affordable daily fee of 20Ksh. Since the launch in 2020, 
over 935,000 4G devices have been connected through the Lipa Mdogo 
Mdogo initiative.

Access to devices and affordability
The digital divide goes beyond just coverage but also relates to usage 
of networks already deployed.

We know that the vast majority of those offline live within mobile 
broadband coverage. There are many barriers preventing the use 
of mobile broadband, including lack of awareness, digital skills, and the 
prohibitive upfront cost of smartphones. Given that smartphones are 
increasingly the main gateway to digital services, lowering the cost 
of devices is key to addressing the digital divide.

Smartphone ownership is lowest in emerging markets, with only 45% of 
adults owning a smartphone compared to 76% in advanced economies. 
Women are also less likely to own a smartphone than men. Affordability 
is one of the key challenges to smartphone adoption as it can cost over 
70% of the average monthly income in vulnerable countries.1

We recognise that we cannot solve this issue by ourselves, and in 2022 
we co-chaired the ITU/UNESCO Broadband Commission for Sustainable 
Development working group on smartphone access. This group 
represents the first multi-stakeholder group looking to address 
smartphone access challenges. The working group drew upon the 
expertise of a cross-sectoral body of commissioners and experts. 
The outcome report, ‘Strategies towards universal smartphone access’ 
identified key interventions to make smartphones accessible to all, 
including; increasing device financing options; introducing fair taxation 
and lower import duties; and improving distribution to remote areas. 
In addition, the working group recommended investigating further the 
use of device subsidies and pre-owned smartphones which was endorsed 
by the UN Broadband Commission at its annual meeting during the 
UN General Assembly in September 2022.

Propositions for equality
Addressing the digital gender gap
The majority of those still unconnected are women. The digital gender 
gap continues to grow in many LDCs, creating a specific need to support 
digital gender equality. In 2022, 69% of men were using the internet, 
compared with 63% of women globally. In the LDCs, just 30% of women 
used the internet in 2022, compared to 92% in high-income countries.2 
Research indicates that women who have access to mobile internet via 
a smartphone have 9% higher levels of wellbeing than women who 
have access via a basic or feature phone. However, across low and 
middle-income countries women are 18% less likely than men to own 
a smartphone and 16% less likely to use mobile internet.3

Focusing on creating relevant services for women is a key strategy to 
bring more women online, as an example, in many African markets 
gaining access to quality health information and antenatal care can be 
very difficult. Information delivered by mobile can help to bridge some of 
the gaps in crucial, basic information. Responding to this, our Mum & Baby 
service continues to grow, giving customers free access to maternal, 
neonatal and child health information in South Africa. The service has 
over 2.3 million registered users in South Africa, helping parents and 
caregivers to take positive actions to improve their children’s health.

In DRC, Vodacom’s Je Suis Cap, or I am Capable programme, aims to 
empower women living with disabilities through digital inclusion. In phase 
1 of this programme, 500 women received free financial education 
training by M-Pesa and Visa to support their entrepreneurship projects 
within their respective communities. Each participant received an M-Pesa 
kit, a smartphone, an equipped point of sale and financing of $275 to get 
their venture started.

Vodafone Egypt launched the Egyptian Gender Alliance in partnership 
with the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, 
National Council for Women, UN Women, and other private sector 
partners. The Alliance promotes the social and economic empowerment 
of women in Egypt through digital inclusion and skills training to increase 
their employability and economic participation.

Enabling quality education and digital skills
Even before the COVID-19 crisis, an estimated 258 million children 
around the world were not in school, and more than half were not 
meeting the minimum expected standards in reading and mathematics.1 
Within six months of the pandemic, at least a third of schoolchildren 
began to drop behind due to lack of access to remote learning,2 and we’re 
still seeing the effects of this today.

The COVID-19 pandemic and its after-effects have highlighted the need 
to adapt teaching to the new realities of increasingly digital societies. We 
have continued to grow our Connected Education programme, providing 
access to our ready-made classroom which includes connectivity, 
devices, and collaboration software for students and teachers across the 
world. To date, around 1.7 million students and teachers in 5,500 
educational institutions across 13 countries have benefited from this 
digital learning solution, helping to bridge the digital divide.

In South Africa, the Vodacom e-School solution allows learners to access 
curriculm-aligned content and educators to access learning materials on 
their smartphones with no data charges. We currently have 1.4 million 
users on the platform.

Research published by Vodafone Foundation in October 2022 revealed 
that while 92% of teachers surveyed believe that schools have a 
responsibility to promote digital literacy, a fifth feel that they themselves 
are not competent enough in the use of digital technologies.3 Vodafone 
Foundation is working to address this by equipping teachers with the 
digital skills and confidence to apply innovative methodologies in the 
classroom. Guided by the EU Digital Competence framework, our 
‘SkillsUpload Jr’ solution provides digital skills training for teachers and 
students, tools for use in schools and access to teaching materials and 
lesson plans via online platforms. More than 2.3 million teachers and 
students have received training to date through SkillsUpload Jr.

Vodafone Foundation also continues to scale Instant Network Schools, its 
partnership with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(‘UNHCR’), which provides education for refugee students and 
communities in the DRC, Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. Since 
2013, this partnership has worked with communities and education 
ministries to transform classrooms into multimedia learning hubs, 
complete with internet connectivity, sustainable solar power, classroom 
kits including tablets, laptops, projectors and speakers, localised digital 
content, and teacher training. In 2023, 84 Instant Network Schools were 
deployed, benefiting 247,000 students. By 2025, Vodafone Foundation 
aims to deploy 300 Instant Network Schools to support 500,000 refugee 
and host-community students and 10,000 teachers.

Evolving platforms for financial inclusion
Goal: To connect 75 million people and their families to mobile money 
services by 31 March 2026.
Two billion people remain unbanked globally.1 Digital services are key to 
helping people access safe, secure financial services and without the 
ability to transfer money, people are limited in their ability to save, access 
loans, start a business and even be paid. Together with Safaricom, we 
developed the first mobile money platform, M-Pesa, which provides 
financial services to millions of people who have a mobile phone but 
limited access to a bank account. It is also widely used to manage 
business transactions and to pay salaries, pensions, agricultural subsidies 
and government grants, and reduces the associated risks of robbery and 
corruption in a cash-based society.

In addition to its core service, we have developed a number of additional 
financial and business services to increase financial independence and 
health. For example, M-Koba provides a platform for groups (such as 
village savings groups) to safely store and manage funds. With security 
features like multiple approvals and group notifications of any 
transactions, the platform enables greater transparency and a more 
efficient way to save as a community. Small enterprises can also increase 
their efficiency by using Lipa Mdogo Mdogo and M-Pesa, allowing 
business owners to pay wages and suppliers, as well as withdraw funds to 
their M-Pesa mobile money wallet and other online bank accounts or to 
an agent.

This year we published new research in partnership with the United 
Nations Development Programme (‘UNDP’) that showed mobile financial 
services can have a direct, positive impact on developing economies with 
a one percentage point higher GDP than in markets with no mobile 
money platforms. Based on previous World Bank research on the 
relationship between economic growth and reductions in the number of 
people living in poverty, this higher GDP per capita implies that countries 
with successful mobile money adoption could reduce poverty by around 
2.6% as a result of these services. Furthermore, the research indicated 
that mobile money services resulted in 1.7 million fewer people living in 
poverty.

Approximately 26 billion transactions were made in the year using 
M-Pesa, the equivalent of almost three million per hour on average 
through a network of more than 670,000 agents. As of the end of March 
2023, 60.7 million customers were using Vodafone’s financial inclusion 
services, which includes 2.2 million in South Africa.

Workplace equality
As part of our purpose, we aim to make the world more connected, 
inclusive and sustainable, where everyone can truly be themselves and 
belong. We bring the human touch to our technology to create a better 
digital future for all, starting with our people.

Our people
We are developing a diverse and inclusive global workforce that reflects 
the customers and societies we serve.

We continued to engage with colleagues and raise awareness of why 
inclusion matters. During the year, we held global sessions focused 
on gender and ethnic diversity, the LGBT+ community, disabilities, and 
wellbeing. These received over 10,000 viewers across all webinars.

Gender diversity
Goal: We aim to have 40% women in management roles by 2030

We have reached 34% which is on track towards our ambition. We continue 
to drive progress through programmes, policies and leadership incentives.

7.  The voluntary turnover rate includes retirements and death-in-service. Further information on 

how this has been calculated is included in the ESG Addendum.

Diversity and inclusion
Our focus is on removing barriers to workplace equality. This year we have 
accelerated momentum on gender equality, sustained focus on LGBT+, built 
on our foundations on race and ethnicity, and taken actions to ensure the 
accessibility of our physical and digital workplace. An expanded focus on 
practising inclusion supports our ambition to create a global workforce that 
reflects the customers, communities and colleagues we serve, and the wider 
societies in which we operate. We believe that embedding inclusion to enable 
diversity is critical to achieving these goals in a sustainable way.

Embedding inclusion
Multiple employee networks operate across Vodafone including Women, 
VodAbility, LGBT+ Friends, Carers and Multicultural Inclusion. We actively 
support them and provide network chairs and sponsors with specific 
leadership development focused on effectively setting up and running 
an employee network.

Global Withstander training has been rolled out in eleven languages 
to upskill employees on how to become active allies by challenging 
negative and inappropriate behaviours when they witness them. 
Over 43,000 employees completed the Withstander training 
during the year.

that left the Company on 31 March 2023. Further information on how employees are defined 
and calculated can be found in the ESG Addendum. 

We work to ensure there is gender diversity when resourcing for senior 
leadership roles and our leadership team is accountable for maintaining 
diversity and inclusion in their teams. Women in management targets 
are also embedded in our long-term incentive plans. Our progress and 
achievements to increase diversity have been recognised externally 
as Vodafone has been included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index 
for the fifth consecutive year.

Across youth programmes, 50% of hires were women. We have also now 
connected with over 11,000 girls via the digital skills programme ‘Code 
Like a Girl’ since 2017. The introduction of digital sessions, and the 
increase in demand from markets affected by the pandemic, has enabled 
us to connect with more girls this year.

Domestic violence
Our global domestic violence policy sets out comprehensive workplace 
resources, support, security and other measures for employees at risk 
of experiencing, and recovering from, domestic violence and abuse.

We continue to provide support in this area through global training, ‘Apps 
Against Abuse’, and a publicly available toolkit to support survivors. ‘Apps 
Against Abuse’ includes the Bright Sky app, which is a safe, easy-to-use 
app and website which provide support and information on how to 
respond to domestic abuse. The Vodafone Foundation’s portfolio of ‘Apps 
Against Abuse’ has connected 2.4 million people to information, advice 
and support (FY22: 1.6 million people).

Menopause
Our external research identified that 62% of women with symptoms 
of menopause found it impacted their work. We made a global ambition 
to support women experiencing menopause, including the release 
of a global toolkit which is freely available to download externally and 
menopause e-learning on common symptoms and the impact on work.

Maternity and parental leave
Our global maternity and parental leave policies are available across 
markets, providing 16 weeks of fully paid leave with a phased return 
to work over six months, where parents work the equivalent of four days 
and are paid for five days. This policy is open to all employees regardless 
of gender, sexual orientation, length of service, and whether their partner 
is having a baby, or they are welcoming a child through surrogacy or 
adoption. This year, over 2,300 women have utilised our maternity leave. 
Over 1,600 men have taken parental leave, with 72% of the latter taking 
four or more weeks of leave. Of those who identify as LGBT+, 2% have 
taken parental leave.

LGBT+
Alongside gender equality, we retained our focus on supporting the LGBT+ 
community with over 3,600 allies and active support from senior executive 
sponsors. We continue to be recognised as a Top Global Employer by 
Stonewall. The Vodafone Foundation launched the Zoteria app in the UK 
to help the LGBT+ community and the wider public to come together 
and tackle the issue of LGBT+ hate crime.

Race, ethnicity, and cultural heritage (‘REACH’)
We continue greater workplace inclusion through allyship and anti-racism. 
REACH fluency training was first completed by all members of the Executive 
Committee, as well as their direct reports, to increase confidence and 
capability to talk about race. Since then, the training has been adapted to local 
context and been rolled out in our European markets. The plan also includes 
reciprocal mentoring, external cross-company mentoring and McKinsey Black 
Leadership Academy participation. In 2020, we set ethnic diversity targets at 
leadership level, which are summarised below.

Physical and digital accessibility in the workplace
We have joined the ‘Valuable 500’ – a group of 500 companies committed 
to disability inclusion in business. The commitments are focused 
on creating a physically and digitally accessible work environment.

During the year, we upskilled our people through continued promotion 
and education accessibility features available within Microsoft 365. We 
also have accessibility guidelines and these are reinforced by workshops 
and training for developers. Assessments were also conducted to improve 
the accessibility of our own products.

We also partnered with Coventry University to understand the skills 
needed for effective remote working, with research taking place in the 
UK, Ireland, Czech Republic, and Turkey. Colleagues from Vodafone took 
part in a new ‘Remote4All’ research project that shed light on the remote 
working experiences of people with disabilities and neurodivergent 
people, including communications, accessibility and technology use, 
work-life balance, social isolation, and manager support.

Leadership diversity
To better understand representation across the organisation and inform 
our diversity and inclusion programmes, we launched ‘#CountMeIn’, an 
initiative which encourages employees to voluntarily self-declare their 
diversity demographics. These include race, ethnicity, disability, sexual 
orientation, gender identity and caring responsibilities, in line with local 
privacy and legal requirements1. Our senior leadership positions have the 
highest self-declaration rate at 85% and this enables transparency of our 
diversity at senior leadership.

The achievement of our diversity targets is dependent on the attraction, 
engagement and retention of diverse talent and skills. To support this, 
we have inclusive initiatives such as: hybrid and flexible working, parental 
leave, a mental health toolkit, learning and development programmes, 
allyship training and menopause support, reinforced by the work of 
employee networks and executive sponsors. During the year, we 
refreshed our training for hiring managers and recruiters to support 
an inclusive candidate experience from application to offer stage. 
Programmes are designed to help employees through all life stages and 
challenge societal norms to create an environment where everyone can 
contribute at their best and thrive.

Planet
Reducing our environmental impact and helping to 
decarbonise society is a part of Vodafone’s purpose. 
Digital technology is key to saving energy, using natural 
resources more efficiently and creating a more circular 
economy to reduce e-waste. This year, the need for 
a green digital transition became ever more urgent, 
as the global climate crisis continued unabated while 
the energy crisis deepened.

Our Planet strategy centres around three key areas: net zero, enablement 
and circularity. We have set ourselves near- and long-term goals across 
these strategic topics to focus our efforts where we believe we can have 
the greatest impact. This year, we continued to progress towards our 
Planet goals. We also continued to integrate environmental considerations 
into the way we operate as a business by strengthening governance, 
data and systems, risk management, and engagement with our people 
– all important foundations for accelerating future action.

Our Planet goals

2025

2030

 – Purchase 100% of the electricity we use globally from 

renewable sources1

 – Reuse, resell or recycle 100% of our network waste

 – Net zero emissions from our operations and from energy 

we purchase and use (Scope 1 & 2)1,2, 3

 – Halve emissions from our value chain (Scope 3)1,2
 – Enable 350 million tonnes of carbon emissions to be avoided 

through green digital solutions4

2040

 – Net zero emissions across our full value chain (Scope 1, 2 & 3)2,3

Notes:
1.  Near-term targets are SBTi approved (since 2020) and are subject to re-validation as part of the 
current process to seek SBTi approval of our long-term (2040) net zero target. Our current SBTi 
approved near-term target includes reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 95% by 2030. 

2.  Against a baseline of financial year ending 31 March 2020.
3.  This year we amended our terminology from ‘fully abate’ to ‘net zero’, to align with definitions in 
the SBTi’s Corporate Net Zero Standard. Going forward, we will seek to align our 2030 and 2040 
net zero targets with the SBTi definition of net zero, which means that we will reduce our carbon 
emissions in absolute terms by 90-95% by our target year (in line with a science-based 1.5 
degree pathway), and neutralise any residual emissions through high quality carbon offsetting. 

4.  Cumulatively from 2020 to 2030, based on carbon emissions avoided by our business 

customers through the use of our green digital solutions, products and services.

Net Zero
Goal: To reduce our own carbon emissions to net zero (Scope 1 & 2) by 
2030 and across the full value chain (Scope 3) by 2040.

We recognise the urgent need to address the global climate crisis. The 
information and communication sector (‘ICT’) is responsible for an estimated 
1.8% to 2.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions.1 As we move towards an 
ever more digital society, with increasing volumes of internet use and mobile 
data traffic, we are committed to driving down our emissions in absolute 
terms as well as shifting our energy mix to renewable sources, in line with 
what is required by science to avoid negative impacts of climate change.

In 2020 we set a SBTi approved 2030 Science-Based Target in line with 
reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C, becoming the first major 
telecoms operator to follow the emission reduction pathway developed 
by SBTi for the ICT sector (setting out specific emissions reduction 
trajectories for mobile, fixed and data centres).

This year, we progressed on our journey to net zero and developed 
business plans to implement the actions required to reduce our carbon 
emissions in line with this pathway. As a next step, we are developing our 
first climate transition plan outlining our key areas for action, collaboration, 
and advocacy to achieve our goal of net zero emissions across our full value 
chain by 2040. We are in the process of having our long-term (2040) net 
zero targets approved under the SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard.2

Our FY23 performance: Our total Scope 1 and market-based method 
Scope 2 GHG emissions decreased by 10% to 0.97 million tonnes of CO2e 
(carbon dioxide equivalent), equivalent to a 52% reduction from our FY20 
baseline. Our Scope 3 emissions increased by 5% to 10.1 million tonnes 
of CO2e, representing a 7% increase from our FY20 baseline, mainly due 
to improvements in our Scope 3 data and calculation methodology.

1.  Freitag, C. et al. (2021), The real climate and transformative impact of ICT: A critique of estimates, 

trends, and regulations.

2.  Continued validation of our long-term net zero target from SBTi, has faced delays due to a high volume 
of companies currently seeking target validation. Subject to the validation process by the SBTi, our long 
term net zero target may change as part of the validation process.

During the year, we upskilled our people through continued promotion 

and education accessibility features available within Microsoft 365. We 

also have accessibility guidelines and these are reinforced by workshops 

and training for developers. Assessments were also conducted to improve 

the accessibility of our own products.

We also partnered with Coventry University to understand the skills 

needed for effective remote working, with research taking place in the 

UK, Ireland, Czech Republic, and Turkey. Colleagues from Vodafone took 

part in a new ‘Remote4All’ research project that shed light on the remote 

working experiences of people with disabilities and neurodivergent 

people, including communications, accessibility and technology use, 

work-life balance, social isolation, and manager support.

To better understand representation across the organisation and inform 

our diversity and inclusion programmes, we launched ‘#CountMeIn’, an 

initiative which encourages employees to voluntarily self-declare their 

diversity demographics. These include race, ethnicity, disability, sexual 

orientation, gender identity and caring responsibilities, in line with local 

privacy and legal requirements1. Our senior leadership positions have the 

highest self-declaration rate at 85% and this enables transparency of our 

diversity at senior leadership.

The achievement of our diversity targets is dependent on the attraction, 

engagement and retention of diverse talent and skills. To support this, 

we have inclusive initiatives such as: hybrid and flexible working, parental 

leave, a mental health toolkit, learning and development programmes, 

allyship training and menopause support, reinforced by the work of 

employee networks and executive sponsors. During the year, we 

refreshed our training for hiring managers and recruiters to support 

an inclusive candidate experience from application to offer stage. 

Programmes are designed to help employees through all life stages and 

challenge societal norms to create an environment where everyone can 

contribute at their best and thrive.

how we plan to reach net zero by 2040: 
investors.vodafone.com/videos

Net zero operations (Scope 1 & 2 emissions)
Our plans to reduce emissions from our operations (Scope 1 & 2 
emissions) focus on driving energy efficiency across our mobile and fixed 
line networks, phasing out the use of fossil fuels and increasing renewable 
sources of energy for both our stationary equipment and vehicle fleet.

Driving energy efficiency
Despite the ever-growing use of data and expansion of our networks, this 
year our total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions decreased by 10% to 0.97 
million tonnes of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent), due to our ongoing 
focus on energy efficiency and an increase in the proportion of renewable 
electricity purchased.

We are committed to continually improving the energy efficiency of our 
mobile access network, fixed access networks and technology centres, 
which together account for 93% of our total global energy consumption. 
We are rolling out new generation network technology, software solutions 
to optimise energy use, and rationalising our property portfolio. During 
FY23, we invested €57 million of capital expenditure in energy efficiency 
and on-site renewable projects which has led to annual savings of 50 GWh. 

We continue to implement the ISO 50001 Energy Management Standard 
globally across our operations. To date, 12 operating companies and 
Safaricom have been awarded certification. This is underpinned by our 
energy data management and analytics system which collects and stores 
data feeds from our electricity suppliers and from smart meters. 
This system is now live across 12 markets in Europe, with smart meters 
installed at over 47,000 sites.

Switching to renewables
To achieve our goal of net zero carbon emissions from our operations by 
2030, we are phasing out the use of fossil fuels such as diesel for stationary 
generators, and petrol or diesel for vehicle fuel. Our goal is to purchase 
100% of the grid electricity we use globally from renewable sources by 
2025. Since July 2021, 100% of the grid electricity used in our European 
network (FY22: 96%), and 81% globally (FY22: 77%), has been purchased 
from renewable sources.

Click to read more about our self-powered mobile masts:  
vodafone.com/self-powered-mobile-masts

On-site renewable generation
This year, we continued to install and deploy new solar photovoltaic (‘PV’) 
systems at sites in the UK, Egypt and South Africa. This increased our 
annual on-site generation of renewable electricity to 14 GWh p.a.

We are also collaborating with partners to develop new innovative 
solutions for renewable energy generation, with ongoing projects to 
install 750 micro wind turbines in Germany, trialling self-powered masts 
in the UK, and developing proof-of-concept mini-grid solutions in 
Mozambique and the DRC.

Purchasing renewable electricity
This was the first full year in which we matched all of the grid electricity 
we used in Europe with renewable sources1 (having been 100% 
renewable in Europe from July 2021). This is significantly ahead of our 
target to power 100% of our global operations with renewable energy by 
2025 and a major milestone towards our net zero goal. We currently have 
purchase power agreements (‘PPAs’) in six countries having signed new 
PPAs in Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK this year, 

Note:

1.  We purchase renewable electricity in accordance with RE100’s Technical Criteria. 

through which we purchased 6% of our renewable grid electricity 
globally. When fully operational, these will generate approximately 40% 
or our grid electricity demand in Europe by 2025. PPAs provide us with 
more economic certainty against current volatile wholesale electricity 
prices. The remainder of our electricity consumption is matched with 
renewable energy certificates (‘RECs’).

We are committed to making the same change to 100% renewable in 
Africa and 20% of our electricity supply in South Africa was matched with 
renewable energy certificates during FY23. 

We are also helping to build a more accessible market for renewables 
across some of our African markets. This year, we established a new 
agreement with the Egyptian government and embarked on discussions 
with the national energy provider in South Africa, Eskom, which aim to 
help us source more renewable power from the electricity grid.

This year, we spent €1.2 billion on purchasing electricity. This is a 
year-on-year increase of approximately 40%, largely driven by exceptional 
and extreme wholesale market conditions.

purchasing strategy: vodafone.com/renewables

Reducing diesel use
We used 72.5 million litres of diesel in FY23 (a 3% increase from FY22: 
70.3 million litres) mainly to fuel generators at sites that are off-grid 
or have unreliable grid electricity supply. We are seeking alternatives to 
diesel, including connecting off-grid sites to the grid where possible, fuel 
cell technology trials (including our successful ammonia fuel cell trial 
in Romania, launched in 2022) and small-scale on-site renewables.

Electrification of our fleet
This year, we progressed with increasing the proportion of electric 
vehicles (‘EVs’) in our company fleet (with EVs making up 49% of the fleet 
compared to 39% in FY22). We launched a global fleet dashboard to 
monitor carbon emissions from company vehicles, and progressed plans 
to phase out purchasing of new vehicles with internal combustion 
engines in our European operations.

Net zero value chain (Scope 3 emissions)
As part of our Science-Based Target, our goal is to halve the carbon 
emissions from our full value chain by 2030 and bring them to net zero 
by 2040 (against a 2020 baseline). This includes our indirect (Scope 3) 
emissions, which we estimate to be 10.1 million tonnes CO2e in FY23 (5% 
higher than the previous year), forming 91% of our total carbon emissions.

Reliable and standardised data from across an entire value chain is 
fundamental to driving down Scope 3 emissions. Today, however, most 
companies are relying heavily on estimates and assumptions for their 
Scope 3 emissions. This year we have invested in enhanced ESG data 
capabilities to improve the quality of our data, including Scope 3 emissions.

The increase in Scope 3 emissions this year is primarily due to 
improvements in the completeness and accuracy of data, and mapping 
to corresponding factors used for calculating emissions from our 
upstream supply chain (mainly purchased goods and services, and capital 
goods). In part, these calculations use a spend-based methodology, 
so this trend was also driven by an increase in procurement spend 
(of approximately €1 billion), which was further amplified by currency 
exchange rate fluctuations over the last year. To help us move away 
from a spend-based methodology in the future, in FY23 we completed 
a project to engage our top four suppliers of network equipment 
(representing 38% of Vodafone’s total network category spend), 
to improve sharing of product carbon footprint data and identify 
opportunities to reduce embedded carbon. We are committed to 
improving Scope 3 data quality to enable us to better understand the 
emissions from our value chain, and ultimately to manage them 
more effectively.

We continued to embed climate-related topics, among other ESG topics 
into our procurement process. In March 2023, we launched a new 
environmentally-linked supply chain financing programme, to provide 
financial incentives for our suppliers to disclose carbon data to the CDP 
and take action to improve their score over time. In partnership with CDP, 
we developed a framework consisting of 12 criteria from the CDP survey 
and sharing their performance score with their supply chain financing 
provider, our suppliers have the opportunity to receive preferential 
financing rates based on their ranking. The programme has initially been 
launched for suppliers using Citibank’s scheme, with a view to expanding 
to other supply chain financing providers over the next year. CDP plans to 
make a template of the framework available to other telecommunication 
industry players, to drive industry-wide adoption of the model. This work 
is a contributing factor in our being recognised by the CDP as a Supplier 
Engagement Leader in 2022. 

Activities to influence our downstream emissions include improving 
consumer awareness of the climate impact of smartphones, through 
marketing of Eco Rating scores that aim to provide consistent and 
accurate information on the environmental impact of products.

Read more about 
Eco Rating on page 38

We are also engaging with our partners and supporting them on their 
decarbonisation journey. In June 2022, we held a summit for our global 
Vodafone sustainable business teams to share knowledge in which 
several of our joint venture partners participated.

A review of emissions from our investments identified the need to update 
the calculation methodology and correct the underlying energy data for 
our joint ventures and associates, Vodafone Idea (which was determined 
to be incomplete in prior year emissions calculations). We have restated 
the Scope 3 category 15 data for all previous years to reflect these 
improvements to data and methodology. 

Industry collaboration and standardised reporting will be crucial to driving 
down Scope 3 emissions, and we will continue to work with partners and 
suppliers to increase the reliability of data.

Enablement
Goal: To enable our business customers reduce their own carbon 
emissions by 350 million tonnes between 2020 and 2030

One of our most important contributions to protecting our planet is 
enabling our customers (which include consumers, businesses, and 
governments) to reduce their environmental footprint using our digital 
technologies and services. We have begun this journey with a focus 
on using green digital solutions to tackle climate change and help 
decarbonise society.

This year, we estimate we have enabled an avoidance of 24.9 million 
tonnes CO2e, which is almost 26 times the emissions generated from our 
own operations (Scope 1 and 2). Since setting our carbon enablement 
target in 2020, we estimate we have enabled our customers to save a 
cumulative 47.6 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Our IoT service offer, 
including logistics, fleet management and smart metering, has been 
pivotal in delivering these savings so far. We estimate that 52% of our 
162.3 million IoT connections directly enabled customers to reduce 
their emissions in the past year.

1.  Enablement figures are estimates. The detailed methodology is available in our ESG Addendum.
2.  Significant year-on-year reduction due to recategorisation of connected car into other transport 

solutions for FY23.

In FY23, we rolled out a carbon enablement toolkit to support product 
teams to understand how the solutions they develop result in carbon 
emission reductions. The toolkit helps them to identify solutions in our 
existing product portfolio that have carbon enablement potential.

As a result, we have been able to measure and report the carbon 
enablement impact of an expanded number of Vodafone Business 
products and services this year, such as remote working solutions, and 
IoT-enabled solutions for mobility and remote monitoring.

In addition, we hosted a customer summit at this year’s London Green 
Tech Festival, and published our ‘Fit for the Future’ insights report, to 
actively engage our Vodafone Business customers to think about our 
collective role in the green digital transition.

We continue to advocate for the green digital transition at forums such 
as the European Green Digital Coalition (‘EGDC’), GSMA and the European 
Roundtable of Industrialists, and by speaking at conferences and events, 
including at COP27.

Circularity 
Goal: To reuse, resell or recycle 100% of our network waste by 2025

The UN estimates that as much as 50 million tonnes of electronic and 
electrical waste (e-waste) are produced globally each year, with only 20% 
formally recycled. As the use of technology expands and develops, we 
are playing our part to address the growing global e-waste problem. 
Our circular economy (or ‘circularity’) initiatives look at two main types of 
e-waste: network equipment (such as radio equipment used to run our fixed 
and mobile access networks) and the electronic devices that we sell to 
customers (such as smartphones).

We reused, resold or recycled 96% of network waste in FY23, in comparison 
from our FY22 performance of 95% (which has been restated from 99% 
to include parts of our network operations and data centres that were 
previously omitted). Our asset marketplace contributed to this and we also 
launched and began to scale up a number of new circular devices initiatives. 
Our initiatives aim to raise consumer awareness of sustainable purchasing, 
extend the lifetime of devices, and improve collection rates for used devices 
so that they stay within a circular system.

1.  Disposed network waste includes used network equipment that is disposed to landfill or incineration.

Circularity of network waste
Our global policy on waste management prioritises the reuse, resale 
or recycling of surplus or obsolete network equipment. We aim to keep 
resources in use for as long as possible, maximising the value employed, 
and then recover and reuse materials responsibly.

We implement resource efficiency and waste disposal management 
programmes in all our markets to minimise environmental impacts 
from network waste and IT equipment waste. This year, we generated 
an estimated 12,400 tonnes of network waste equipment (including 
hazardous waste). We reused and recycled 96% of the non-hazardous 
waste; partly via our asset marketplace, which was established in 2020 to 
resell and repurpose excess or decommissioned network equipment, thus 
extending its useful life. This year, we estimate that we have saved €14.7 
million of spend and avoided over 1,143 tonnes of CO2e through our asset 
marketplace platform. This is in addition to the reuse of equipment within 
individual operating companies. For example, Vodafone UK avoided 
an estimated 1,466 tonnes of CO2e in FY23 by reusing equipment. 

Circularity of devices
Across our industry small IT equipment and electronics, such as devices, 
constitute around 9% of total e-waste generated.1 We aim to reduce our 
impact in this area by implementing circular devices initiatives in 
conjunction with our partners and other operators.

Improving collection rates for used devices
Our previous metric that measured weight of products collected via 
product take-back schemes is not reported in FY23 as we have retired it 
in place of our newly formed partnership with WWF. In November 2022 
we launched our ‘1 million phones for the planet’ campaign, to raise 
consumer awareness of e-waste and incentivise our customers to bring 
back their used devices for trade-in, donation or recycling. WWF’s ability 
to deliver impactful environment projects, combined with Vodafone’s 
digital technology capabilities and our reach across a global consumer 
audience, will enable us to show how technology can help overcome 
sustainability and conservation challenges.

This year we also we launched a new e-waste compensation partnership 
in Germany. Our ‘One for One’ campaign promises that for every phone 
purchased directly from us, our partners at Closing the Loop will collect 
one for recycling from an African country that does not have safe 
recycling infrastructure or systems. This diverts e-waste from landfill 
or incineration, whilst also enabling valuable materials such as gold 
and palladium to be recovered from otherwise hazardous waste. 
Our partnership with Closing the Loop aims to enable the safe collection 
and recycling of over one million scrap devices per year.

Extending the lifetime of devices
In partnership with Recommerce, our ‘Trade in’ campaign encourages 
customers to extend the lifetime of their device by trading it in to be 
refurbished and resold. Our digital trade-in platform, now live in four 
European markets, offers customers a guaranteed price to make the 
trade-in customer journey convenient, cost-effective and attractive.

Notes:

2.  ADEME (2022) Assessment of the environmental impact of a set of refurbished products

We are also encouraging our customers to consider purchasing 
second-life devices. Purchasing a refurbished smartphone saves around 
50kg of CO2e – making its contribution to climate change 87% lower than 
that of the equivalent, newly manufactured smartphone – and removes 
the need to extract 76.9 kg of raw materials.2 We are offering customers 
high quality and competitively priced refurbished smartphone ranges 
in UK, Turkey, and Vodacom.

We also continue to collect, refurbish and reuse fixed line equipment 
(such as broadband routers) multiple times, to drive significant associated 
environmental and cost savings.

Improving consumer awareness of product sustainability
We are continuing our engagement in the Eco Rating labelling scheme 
jointly with other major European operators. Eco Rating is a pan-industry 
initiative to help consumers identify and compare the sustainability of 
mobile phones on the market, whilst also encouraging suppliers to 
reduce the environmental impact of devices.

In November 2022, Eco Rating expanded to reach 35 countries, 
supported by 22 manufacturers and a total of eight operators. Since its 
introduction, the rating has contributed to improving the environmental 
performance of mobile phones on the market, illustrated by the increase 
of the average Eco Rating score from 74 to 76 out of a maximum 100 
since it was launched 18 months ago. We now operate this initiative in 12 
markets with over 200 handsets assessed and available to our customers.

Reducing virgin plastic use
We continue to reduce use of single-use plastics, replacing them with 
lower-impact alternatives across all our retail stores, offices and logistics 
operations in collaboration with our logistics providers. To reduce virgin 
plastic use in our SIM cards, we have continued to roll out half-size SIMs 
made from recycled plastics. 

Where plastic must be used, we aim to use recycled plastic. For example, 
our new Ultrahub broadband router uses 95% recycled plastic in the 
product housing and the packaging is made using 85% recycled 
materials, both of which are 100% recyclable at the end of life.

Partnerships and collaboration
Reducing our environmental impact is a challenge that we know we 
cannot achieve alone. Partnerships are essential to addressing the climate 
and nature crises. We work with a number of valued partners at a global 
and local level to deliver initiatives across our Planet strategy.

Together with Vodafone Egypt and Vodacom, we re-affirmed our 
commitment to climate leadership through our headline sponsorship 
of the COP27 UN Climate Change Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh in 
November 2022. Our presence demonstrated our resolve for businesses 
to take an active role in bringing about the green digital transition. 
In addition to providing essential digital connectivity services for the 
conference and its delegates, we showcased examples of innovative 
green digital solutions that can help reduce global carbon emissions and 
optimise resource efficiency – including our agricultural platforms such 
as MyFarmWeb and Connected Farmer solutions, which are supporting 
over five million farmers across Africa to minimise agricultural inputs like 
vehicle fuel, water and chemicals, whilst maintaining crop yields.

Engaging our people on Planet
We are engaging people across Vodafone to think about environmental 
impacts and risks as part of their own business decision-making. 
Our ‘#RedLovesGreen’ community is the largest employee group outside 
of core business topics on Workplace (Vodafone’s internal collaborative 
communication platform) with more than 12,000 colleagues who are 
engaged on environmental subjects. In FY23 we launched a series of 
webinars called ‘Green Talks’, covering topics including climate change 
science and net zero.

1.  Disposed network waste includes used network equipment that is disposed to landfill or incineration.

Circularity of network waste

Our global policy on waste management prioritises the reuse, resale 

or recycling of surplus or obsolete network equipment. We aim to keep 

resources in use for as long as possible, maximising the value employed, 

and then recover and reuse materials responsibly.

We implement resource efficiency and waste disposal management 

programmes in all our markets to minimise environmental impacts 

from network waste and IT equipment waste. This year, we generated 

an estimated 12,400 tonnes of network waste equipment (including 

hazardous waste). We reused and recycled 96% of the non-hazardous 

waste; partly via our asset marketplace, which was established in 2020 to 

resell and repurpose excess or decommissioned network equipment, thus 

extending its useful life. This year, we estimate that we have saved €14.7 

million of spend and avoided over 1,143 tonnes of CO2e through our asset 

marketplace platform. This is in addition to the reuse of equipment within 

individual operating companies. For example, Vodafone UK avoided 

an estimated 1,466 tonnes of CO2e in FY23 by reusing equipment. 

Circularity of devices

Across our industry small IT equipment and electronics, such as devices, 

constitute around 9% of total e-waste generated.1 We aim to reduce our 

impact in this area by implementing circular devices initiatives in 

conjunction with our partners and other operators.

Improving collection rates for used devices

Our previous metric that measured weight of products collected via 

product take-back schemes is not reported in FY23 as we have retired it 

in place of our newly formed partnership with WWF. In November 2022 

we launched our ‘1 million phones for the planet’ campaign, to raise 

consumer awareness of e-waste and incentivise our customers to bring 

back their used devices for trade-in, donation or recycling. WWF’s ability 

to deliver impactful environment projects, combined with Vodafone’s 

digital technology capabilities and our reach across a global consumer 

audience, will enable us to show how technology can help overcome 

sustainability and conservation challenges.

This year we also we launched a new e-waste compensation partnership 

in Germany. Our ‘One for One’ campaign promises that for every phone 

purchased directly from us, our partners at Closing the Loop will collect 

one for recycling from an African country that does not have safe 

recycling infrastructure or systems. This diverts e-waste from landfill 

or incineration, whilst also enabling valuable materials such as gold 

and palladium to be recovered from otherwise hazardous waste. 

Our partnership with Closing the Loop aims to enable the safe collection 

and recycling of over one million scrap devices per year.

Extending the lifetime of devices

In partnership with Recommerce, our ‘Trade in’ campaign encourages 

customers to extend the lifetime of their device by trading it in to be 

refurbished and resold. Our digital trade-in platform, now live in four 

European markets, offers customers a guaranteed price to make the 

trade-in customer journey convenient, cost-effective and attractive.

We contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals 
The UN Sustainable Development Goals (‘SDGs’) 
provide a blueprint for human progress and a clear call 
to action for businesses to contribute to a better future. 

Examples of our projects and initiatives supporting 
the SDGs over the last year

Read more about our contribution to the SDGs: 
vodafone.com/sdgs

The confluence of the climate crisis and the macro economic downturn 
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing challenges 
for society, particularly in less developed countries, and led to a reversal 
of progress on a number of SDGs. For example, we have seen the first rise 
in extreme poverty in a generation, with around 120 million people pushed 
back into extreme poverty1. Furthermore, the UN estimates that COVID-19 
has wiped out 20 years of educational gains, with secondary school 
completion rates at just 53%, and this is predicted to decline.1

Digital technology will be essential in reducing these impacts and helping 
progress towards delivering the SDGs. We are committed to playing our role 
and believe we can increase the speed and scale of delivery across a wide 
number of SDGs through leveraging our technology and services, and 
through partnering with others. Simultaneously, we can drive significant 
growth. For example, our M-Pesa mobile money platform, designed to 
enable financial inclusion, has 58.5 million active customers (including 
Ghana). Excluding Safaricom, M-Pesa revenue in FY23 was €444 million.

We enable inclusive and sustainable digital societies
At Vodafone we are accelerating connectivity and digitalisation in 
order to meet the SDGs by 2030. We have identified two priority 
SDGs (SDG 9 build resilient infrastructure and innovation, and SDG 17 
strengthen the means of implementation and partnerships for 
sustainable development) that will enable us and our partners to find 
lasting solutions to social, economic and environmental challenges 
and thereby accelerate the delivery of other SDGs.

Read more about our partnerships 
on page 30 to 32 and 37 to 38

The SDGs will only be achieved in partnership, and we continue to 
pioneer new models of cooperation between business, governments, 
international organisations, and civil society to deliver process and scale. 
For example, we were a founding member of the International 
Telecommunication Union’s Partner2Connect coalition to 
connect the unconnected. We also initiated and co-led the first 
multi-stakeholder working group on smartphone access and 
affordability under the auspices of the Broadband Commission for 
Sustainable Development.

This year, our partnership in Ethiopia with Safaricom, Sumitomo 
Corporation and CDC Group launched a new network in Ethiopia 
combining our innovation and technology to help solve customer 
and societal challenges in the region.

We have also increased our partnerships to address the climate crisis. 
This includes our partnership with the Egyptian government and 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in COP27 
in Egypt in November 2022, and our global partnership with WWF that 
will support our goals to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2040 
and encourage a more circular economy for mobile phones. 

Through connectivity infrastructure, digital innovations and 
partnerships, we deliver impact across many of the SDGs.

Responsible business
To underpin the delivery of our purpose, we ensure 
that we operate in a responsible way. Acting 
ethically, lawfully and with integrity is critical to our 
long-term success.

This section of the Strategic Report covers the elements underpinning 
our responsible business strategy. On this page, we explain how we 
embed an understanding of our Code of Conduct throughout the Group 
and provide our people and suppliers with access to a whistleblowing 
hotline (‘Speak Up’). This section also summarises our approach to 
protecting data and people, as well as how we ensure we behave 
ethically, lawfully and with integrity wherever we operate.

Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct sets out what we expect from every single person 
working for Vodafone, regardless of location. We also expect our suppliers 
and business partners to uphold the same standards as set out in our 
Code of Ethical Purchasing.

Click here to read our Code of Conduct: 
vodafone.com/code-of-conduct

Our Doing What’s Right (‘DWR’) training and communication programme is 
key to embedding a shared understanding of the Code of Conduct across 
Vodafone. Throughout the year, the Doing What’s Right communication 
programme promoted different areas of our Code of Conduct, including 
Speak Up, anti-bribery, privacy, competition law, security, and health and 
safety. In FY23, we launched a campaign to reinforce how line managers have 
a critical responsibility to be a role model for ethics and integrity at Vodafone 
and create a culture where we take decisions that foster trust and admiration.

Training in our Code of Conduct is mandatory for all employees and is 
included in our standard induction process for new employees. This year 
we have upgraded our DWR learning strategy moving from training every 
two years to a learning intervention every year. Of those employees 
assigned Doing What’s Right training, 93% had completed the training as 
at 31 March 2023. From FY24 onwards, end-of-year reward linked to an 
individual’s impact will be underpinned by minimum standards, including 
completion of our Doing What’s Right training, that reinforce our 
commitment to building an ethical culture.

We also strive to make compliance easy for our employees and continue to 
improve our digital Code of Conduct and Global Policy Portal, the internal 
platform where employees can find information about our policies and 
procedures. During FY23, 220,000 visits to these portals were logged which 
is an indicator that our employees are engaging with our policies.

Our Code of Conduct is well understood throughout Vodafone. In our 
latest Spirit Beat employee survey, 95% of respondents agreed with the 
statement ‘Our team lives by the Code of Conduct’.

Speak Up
Everyone who works for or on behalf of Vodafone has a responsibility to 
report any behaviour at work that may be unlawful or criminal, or could 
amount to an abuse of our policies, systems or processes and therefore 
be a breach of our Code of Conduct. Employees are able to raise 
concerns with a line manager, with a colleague from human resources or 
through our anonymous confidential third-party hotline, Speak Up, which 
is accessible in local languages online or by telephone.

We have a non-retaliation policy when a genuine concern has been 
reported. Everyone who raises a concern in good faith is treated fairly, 
with no negative consequences for their employment with Vodafone, 
regardless of the outcome of any subsequent investigation.

Speak Up reports are confidentially investigated by local specialist teams, 
with a senior team in place to triage reports. Each grievance is monitored 
to verify that any corrective action plan or remediation has been 
conducted. Our Group Risk and Compliance Committee reviews the 
effectiveness of the Speak Up process and trends twice a year, and the 

Audit and Risk Committee receives an annual update, with additional 
ad hoc reviews also carried out where appropriate.

Our employees trust our Speak Up process, as evidenced by our 
September 2022 Spirit Beat survey, with 85% of respondents agreeing 
that they believe appropriate action would be taken as a result of using 
the process. We also track the proportion of ‘named’ versus ‘anonymous’ 
reports as a higher number of named reports suggests higher levels 
of trust in the Speak Up process. During the year, 57% (FY22: 64%) 
of reports were ‘named’ and this was higher than available 
industry benchmarks.

This year, 505 (FY22: 642) separate concerns were reported using Speak 
Up. Speak Up reports could relate to matters of unlawful behaviour or 
matters of integrity, such as bribery, fraud, price fixing, a conflict of interest, 
or a breach of data privacy. Reports could also relate to people issues such 
as discrimination, bullying or harassment, danger to the health and safety 
of employees or the public, or potential abuses of human rights.

If we decide to proceed with an investigation, a qualified expert will 
investigate, keeping the person who raised the concern informed 
throughout the process. Where reports made to Speak Up require 
remedial action, this could include consequences at the individual level, 
or changes to internal processes and procedures.

Speak Up is owned by the Chief Human Resources Officer and overseen 
by the Group Risk and Compliance Committee. In 2022, we undertook 
a review of the Speak Up process to check it against the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights requirements.

Speak Up is also made available to our suppliers and is communicated 
through our Code of Ethical Purchasing. For suppliers that decide to maintain 
their own grievance mechanisms, we require that they inform us of any 
grievances raised relating to work done on behalf of Vodafone directly.

Protecting data
Millions of people communicate and share 
information over our networks, enabling them to 
connect, innovate and prosper. Customers trust us 
with their data and maintaining this trust is critical.

Data privacy
We believe that everyone has a right to privacy wherever they live in 
the world, and our commitment to our customers’ privacy goes beyond 
legal compliance. As a result, our privacy programme applies globally, 
irrespective of whether there are local data protection or privacy laws.

Our privacy management policy is based on the European Union General 
Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) and this is applied across Vodafone 
markets both inside and outside the European Economic Area. 
Our privacy management policy establishes a framework within which 
local data protection and privacy laws are respected and sets a baseline 
for those markets where there are no equivalent legal requirements.

Privacy risks
As data volumes continue to grow and regulatory and customer scrutiny 
increases, it is important to be clear on the privacy risks we face, as well as 
how our policies and programmes can mitigate these risks. We categorise 
data privacy risk into three main areas:

 – Collection: collection of personal data without permissions or 

excessive collection of data;

 – Access & use: use of personal data for unauthorised purposes, 

excessive data retention or poor data quality; and

 – Sharing: unauthorised disclosure of personal data, including supplier 

non-compliance with the law or our own policies.

To help us identify and manage evolving risks, we constantly evaluate our 
business strategy, new technologies, products and services, as well as 
government policies and regulation.

Privacy principles
Our privacy programme governs how we collect, use and manage our 
customers’ personal data to ensure we respect the confidentiality of their 
communications and any choices that they have made regarding the use 
of their data. Our privacy programme is based on the following principles: 
accountability; fairness and lawfulness; choice and access; security 
safeguards; privacy by design; openness and honesty; responsible data 
management; and balance.

Using customer data
We want to enable our customers to get the most out of our products 
and services. To provide these services, we need to use our customers’ 
personal information. We aim to protect our customers’ data, use it for 
a stated and specific purpose, and we are always open about what 
customer data we collect, and why we collect it.

Each local market publishes a Privacy Statement to provide clear, 
transparent and relevant information on how we collect and use personal 
data, what choices are available regarding its use and how customers can 
exercise their rights. Our product-specific privacy notices include details 
relating to a particular product. These statements and notices are available 
to customers online, in the MyVodafone app and in our retail stores.

We provide our customers with access to their data through online and 
physical channels. These channels can be used also to request deletion 
of data that is no longer necessary, or for correction of outdated or incorrect 
data, or for data portability. Our customer privacy statements and other 
customer facing documents provide comprehensive information on how 
these rights can be exercised and how to raise complaints or contact the 
relevant data protection authority. Our frontline retail and customer support 
staff are trained to respond to customers’ requests.

Our state-of-the-art, multi-channel permission management approach 
was deployed across our channels (MyVodafone app, website, call 
centres and retail stores) in 2018. This approach allows our customers 
to control how we use their data for marketing and other purposes at 
any time and the permissions are synchronised across our channels. 
For example, customers can:

 – Opt-in for processing of special categories of data;
 – Choose what data we collect through the MyVodafone app and how 

it is used;

 – Opt-out from marketing across different channels (call, SMS, 

notifications), or opt-in to the use of their communications metadata 
for marketing purposes or for receiving third-party marketing 
messages; and

 – Opt-out from the use of anonymised network and location data 

(‘Vodafone Analytics’).

Case study: Privacy-first digital advertising 
Following a trial of a new ‘TrustPid’ solution, we have formed a new 
joint venture with three other major European telecommunications 
operators. TrustPid is a technology for data protection-compliant 
digital marketing, allowing consumers to enjoy free content and the 
benefits of the open internet whilst maintaining control over their 
privacy. TrustPid requires express consent of the user to be activated 
and offers a centralised self-serve privacy portal enabling users to 
review and manage their consents across websites participating in 
the service at any time. Users can revoke their consents all at once 
or individually per website, as well as block the service.

TrustPid works with secure, unique network-based digital  
tokens generated using the IP address of the user and multiple 
de-identification steps to break the ‘link-ability’ back to the users. 
The telecommunications providers are responsible for creating a 
pseudonymised network ID which is used by the TrustPid platform 
to generate the additional digital tokens. The telecommunications 
providers do not enhance the tokens with any customer or traffic 
data, nor is any other directly identifiable data, such as name or email 
address, shared or processed by the service in any other way. The 
digital tokens shared with advertisers and publishers are randomised, 
specific for each domain and have a limited lifespan of up to 90 days. 
These allow advertisers and publishers to provide users with a 
personalised experience on their websites, apps and services, without 
being able to trace them back to reveal the personal identity of the 
individuals, and always with the requirement that the user must have 
provided express prior consent for each individual site. These 
measures reduce the risk of uncontrolled cross-site tracking, data 
sharing and profiling across different partners – one of the big 
drawbacks for consumers in the way digital advertising works today. 
Transparency, control and data minimisation are key principles for 
TrustPid which seeks to provide a privacy first solution whereby 
only the minimum personal data for the service to work is processed 
and shared on a need-to-know basis.

The European Commission has provided unconditional approval for 
the creation of the joint venture and the joint venture partners have 
now tested the platform with advertisers and publishers in Germany 
and Spain. All local data protection authorities were consulted before 
the trial was initiated. Following completion of the trial at the end 
of May 2023, the joint venture will outline its vision and strategy, 
including information about next steps and a commercial launch, 
which will be announced in due course by a new company called Utiq.

Operating model
We have an experienced team of privacy specialists dedicated to ensuring 
compliance with data protection laws and our policies in the countries 
where we operate.

We apply a process-based approach to managing privacy risks across the data 
lifecycle and teams from across Vodafone ensure end-to-end coverage. 
Dedicated security teams ensure appropriate technical and organisational 
information security measures are applied to protect personal data against 
unauthorised access, disclosure, loss or use during transit and at rest.

Read more about cyber security  
on pages 42 to 43 and 53

All products, services and processes are subject to privacy impact 
assessments as part of their development and throughout their lifecycle. 
We maintain personal data processing records, supplier privacy 
compliance, data breach management and individual rights processes, 
as well as internal and international data transfer compliance frameworks, 
and training and awareness programmes.

In our supply chain, privacy and security requirements form a key part of 
our supplier management processes. All suppliers go through a thorough 
onboarding process to verify their adherence with these requirements, 
appropriate data protection agreements are agreed, and suppliers are 
subject to continuous monitoring.

Our teams monitor and influence regulatory and industry developments 
and work to build and maintain relationships with local data protection 
authorities and other key stakeholders.

Our privacy control frameworks are subject to continuous risk-based 
improvements. In addition to introducing updates to our global privacy 
controls, we also require every employee, and where possible contractors, 
to complete Doing What’s Right privacy training within six weeks of joining 
and then in line with our annual learning intervention cycle. We also have 
targeted training for high-risk roles which is aimed at teams with a key 
role in personal data processing. With this approach we aim to achieve 
a 90% completion rate on both types of training across all target groups 
across our global footprint. In FY23, 95% of assigned employees 
completed Doing What’s Right or more specific privacy training.

The effectiveness of control implementation is subject to quarterly 
reporting, and annual evidence-based testing by the privacy teams, as 
well as internal audit. Control implementation is also reviewed by local 
market CEOs, the Group Risk and Compliance Committee and the Audit 
and Risk Committee. Any findings are subject to remedial actions by the 
responsible control operator, and completion is monitored.

Governance
The General Counsel and Company Secretary, a member of the Executive 
Committee, oversees the global privacy programme. The Group Privacy 
Officer, reporting to the General Counsel, is responsible for managing 
and overseeing the privacy programme on a day-to-day basis across the 
markets and provides regular status reports to the General Counsel and 
Company Secretary and an annual update to the Audit and Risk 
Committee. During the year, the Group Chief Executive also introduced 
regular compliance reviews to ensure operating companies were 
adhering to the Group’s policies and procedures. This included oversight 
of our privacy programme.

Whilst each employee is responsible for protecting personal data they 
are trusted with, accountability for compliance sits with each operating 
company. A member of the local executive committee oversees the local 
implementation of our privacy programme. Each operating company also 
has a dedicated privacy officer, privacy legal counsel and other privacy 
specialists. Local privacy officers report to the Group Privacy Officer 
throughout the year.

The Privacy Leadership team approves new standards and guidelines and 
monitors the implementation of global privacy plans. Operating companies 
also maintain privacy steering committees that bring together privacy and 
security teams and senior management from relevant business functions.

Privacy incidents
We have a strong culture of data privacy and our assurance and 
monitoring activities are designed to identify potential issues before they 
materialise. However, during the financial year, Vodafone was fined 
€1 million (FY22: €2 million) for separate data privacy issues, primarily 
relating to fraudulent SIM swaps, telesales and marketing without 
consent, human and system errors in data processing, and delayed 
execution of data subject rights. In response, we have introduced new 
standards and increased monitoring.

Cyber security
Our role is to enable connectivity in society. As a provider of critical 
national infrastructure and connectivity that is relied upon by millions of 
customers, we prioritise cyber and information security across everything 
we do. Our customers use Vodafone products and services because of 
our next-generation connectivity, but also because they trust that their 
information is secure.

Cyber attacks are part of the technology landscape today and will be 
in the future. All organisations, governments and people will be subject 
to cyber attacks and some will be successful. The telecommunications 
industry is faced with a unique set of risks as we provide connectivity 
services and handle private communication data. Our operating model is 
designed based on this knowledge and focused on how we prevent, 
detect and respond to attacks to minimise the impact.

We have published a separate factsheet which provides more detail 
on our approach to managing cyber risk at Vodafone, as well as how 
we protect our customers from cyber threats. The following section 
is a summary of our approach.

Our cyber security strategy
Our vision is a secure connected future for our customers and society. 
We are motivated by a clear purpose to inspire customer trust and loyalty 
by providing sustained cyber security, ultimately contributing to a secure 
society and an inclusive future for all.

Our cyber security strategy sets out how we plan to achieve these goals. 
It is aligned to, and forms part of, Vodafone’s 2025 technology strategy. 
Our cyber security strategy has six pillars: control evolution, secure 
by design, dynamic trust, real-time data & real-time response, Spirit 
of Vodafone and culture, and security for society.

Identification of vulnerabilities and risks
Cyber security is one of Vodafone’s principal risks. We understand that 
if not managed effectively, there could be major customer, financial, 
reputation, stakeholder or regulatory impacts. Risk and threat 
management are fundamental to maintaining the security of our services 
across every aspect of our business.

To help us identify and manage emerging and evolving risks, we 
constantly evaluate and challenge our business strategy, new 
technologies, government policies and regulation, and cyber threats. 
We conduct regular reviews of the most significant security risks affecting 
our business and develop strategies and policies to detect, prevent 
and respond to them. Our cyber security strategy focuses on minimising 
the risk of cyber incidents that affect our networks and services. 
When incidents do occur, we identify the root causes and use them to 
improve our controls.

management are fundamental to maintaining the security of our services 

across every aspect of our business.

We conduct regular reviews of the most significant security risks affecting 

our business and develop strategies and policies to detect, prevent 

and respond to them. Our cyber security strategy focuses on minimising 

the risk of cyber incidents that affect our networks and services. 

When incidents do occur, we identify the root causes and use them to 

improve our controls.

Risk and control framework
Controls can prevent, detect or respond to risks. Most risks and threats are 
prevented from occurring and most will be detected before they cause 
harm and need a response. A small minority will need recovery actions.

We use a common global framework called the Cyber Security Baseline 
and it is mandatory across the entire Group. The baseline is based on an 
international standard and includes key security controls which 
significantly reduce cyber security risk by preventing, detecting or 
responding to events and attacks. We have effectiveness targets for the 
key controls that are monitored and reported to senior management for 
each market every month. The framework is regularly reviewed and new 
controls or new targets identified each year.

As well as monitoring control effectiveness within Vodafone, we oversee 
the cyber security of our suppliers and third parties with a dedicated team. 
At supplier onboarding, security requirements are written into contracts, 
and we determine the inherent risk of the supplier based on the service 
they are providing. We then assess their controls to understand the 
residual risk, which informs the frequency of review. We follow up on 
open actions and ensure security incidents are tracked and managed.

A dedicated assurance team reviews and validates the effectiveness of 
our security controls, and our control environment is subject to regular 
internal audit. The security of our mobile networks is also independently 
tested and benchmarked versus other telecommunications operators 
every year to assure we are maintaining the highest standards and our 
controls are operating effectively. We maintain independently audited 
information security certifications, including ISO 27001, which cover our 
global technology function and 15 local markets. In addition, our markets 
comply with national information security requirements where applicable.

Read more about our identification of cyber threat  
as a principal risk on page 53

New technologies, industry practice and regulations
We adopt new technologies to better serve our customers and gain 
operational efficiency. For every technology programme, new or existing, 
we follow our Security by Design process, evaluating suppliers’ hardware 
and software, modelling threats and understanding the risks before 
designing, implementing and testing the necessary security controls.

We anticipate threats will continue from existing sources, but also evolve 
in areas such as 5G, IoT, vendor software integrity, quantum computing 
and the use of artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and machine learning.

More broadly, we actively engage with stakeholders, including industry 
and government, in order to protect Vodafone, respond to cyber threats 
and work together to share best practice. Given our expertise and 
extensive experience, we also engage with a wide range of organisations 
to help improve the understanding of cyber security thinking and 
practice, and contribute to public policy, technical standards, information 
sharing and analysis, risk assessment, and governance.

We expect a significant increase in security regulation over the next few 
years as governments respond to the heightened cyber threat landscape, 
recognising that telecommunications operators provide critical national 
infrastructure. We engage directly with governments and industry 
partners to promote proportionate, risk-based and cost-effective solutions 
to security threats. We look to establish shared approaches to reinforce 
standardisation and regulatory frameworks that apply equally to all 
market participants.

Operating model
We have implemented an operating model based on the leading industry 
security standards published by the US National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (‘NIST’). The model is designed to reduce risk through 
constantly protecting, defending and improving our security. We have an 
in-house international team of almost 1,000 employees and we also work 
with third-party experts in specialist areas. Our scale means we benefit 
from global collaboration, technology sharing and deep expertise, and 
ultimately have greater visibility of emerging threats.

Although the cyber team leads on detect, respond and recover, 
preventative and protective controls are embedded across all our 
technology and throughout the entire business. Every employee has 
responsibility for cyber security and must follow the Vodafone Cyber 
Code, be sensitive to threats and report suspicious activity. Embedded 
in our Code of Conduct, the Cyber Code is the cornerstone of how we 
expect all employees to behave when it comes to best practice in cyber 
security. It consists of seven areas where employees need to follow 
security good practice.

Cyber Code in our Code of Conduct:

Cyber security is included within our Doing What’s Right training 
programme and our latest module was translated for non-English-
speaking markets during the year, having been launched in English last 
year. We are also about to launch a training manual for contractors. 
Training on our Code of Conduct and cyber security is included in our 
standard induction process for new employees, and we expect every 
employee to complete annual learning interventions when assigned.

Governance
The Chief Technology Officer and Chief Network Officer are the Executive 
Committee members responsible for managing the risks associated with 
cyber threats and information security. The Cyber Security, Technology 
Assurance and Strategy (‘CTAS’) Director is responsible for managing and 
overseeing the cyber security programme on a day-to-day basis and 
reports to the Chief Technology Officer. Reporting to the CTAS Director 
are the heads of the global cyber security functions and markets or 
regions. The local cyber security leads are part of their local management 
teams and responsible for the cyber agenda in their market or region.

Key risk indicators for our most important controls and our security 
baseline are reported to senior management and the Executive 
Committee every month. Cyber threats and information security are a 
major area of focus for the Board’s Audit and Risk Committee and detailed 
updates including threat landscape, incidents, security position, residual 
risk and security strategy and programme progress were provided by the 
CTAS Director twice during the year, most recently in March 2023.

Read more about the Audit and Risk Committee’s oversight  
of cyber security on pages 77 to 82

Cyber incidents
As a global connectivity provider, we are subject to a range of cyber 
threats. We use our layers of controls to identify, block and mitigate 
threats and reduce any business or customer impact. Where a security 
incident occurs, we have a consistent incident management framework 
and an experienced team to manage our response. The focus of our 
incident responders is always fast risk mitigation and customer security.

In the event of a cyber breach, disclosure is made in line with local 
regulations and laws, and based on a risk assessment considering 
customers, law enforcement and relevant authorities. The European 
Union’s GDPR provides a framework for notifying customers in the event 
there is a loss of customer data because of a data breach, and this 
framework is a baseline across all our markets.

Vodafone classifies security incidents on a scale (S0-S4) according to 
severity, measured by business and customer impact. We attribute root 
causes to incidents and use the information to improve our control 
effectiveness. The highest severity category (S0) corresponds to a 
significant data breach or loss of service caused by the incident. There 
have been no cyber incidents classified at this level in the past financial 
year. Even with an increased threat landscape, we have seen a gradual 
decline in the numbers of more severe incidents.

Protecting people
Wherever we operate, we have an opportunity to 
contribute to the advancement of fundamental 
rights for our customers, colleagues and communities. 
We are also conscious of the risks associated with 
our operations and we work hard to mitigate 
negative impacts, ensuring we keep people safe.

Health and safety
Keeping people safe is one of the most important responsibilities we 
hold as an employer. Our ongoing focus is to provide a safe working 
environment for everyone working for and on behalf of Vodafone and the 
communities in which we operate. We want to ensure that everyone is 
safe when working with and for Vodafone.

Our health and safety framework provides a consistent approach to 
safety leadership, planning, performance monitoring, governance and 
assurance. Our commitment to safety does not differentiate between 
employees, contractors and suppliers, all of whom benefit from the same 
focus on preventing harm, both on worksites and when working or 
moving between sites.

Health and safety risks
We continue to focus on our key health and safety risks, which account 
for the majority of reported incidents and remain a focus area globally: 
occupational road risk, falls from height, and working with electricity 
and fibre.

Road traffic incidents continue to be the primary cause of major injuries 
and fatalities reported globally, accounting for 58% of incidents classified 
as ‘high potential’ during the year. We continue to focus on road safety 
and driver behaviour within our global health and safety strategy and 
operating company plans. In addition, local market road risk controls are 
reviewed as part of our internal assurance plans.

In recognition of our key health and safety risks, we established the 
‘Vodafone Absolute Rules’. These rules focus on risks that present the 
greatest potential for harm for anyone working for or on behalf of 
Vodafone. The Absolute Rules apply everywhere we work and provide 
clear expectations for safe behaviour for everyone to follow. The Absolute 
Rules must be followed by all Vodafone employees and contractors, as 
well as our suppliers’ employees and contractors. Where this requirement 
is not met, we take appropriate management actions. In the September 
2022 Spirit Beat survey, 94% of employees agreed that the Absolute 
Rules are taken seriously at Vodafone.

Leadership engagement
Our Executive Committee and operating company executive committees 
provide visible and clear leadership in health and safety. These senior 
leaders are actively engaged and carry out regular face-to-face site tours 
throughout the year as they recognise the importance of connecting with 
teams and critical workers as they continue to maintain our networks, 
work in our retail stores and on customer sites. We ensure everyone has 
access to senior leadership support in health and safety matters, as this 
is critical to encouraging people to voice any concerns.

We also launched our mandatory ‘Leading for Health & Safety at Work’ 
e-learning module. This module sets out the specific impact we expect 
our leaders to have, such as:

 – Set high and visible standards for health and safety, and continuously 

challenge others to do the same;

 – Build and sustain an authentic, preventative, and caring safety culture;
 – Empower and encourage their teams to take ownership; and
 – Be well informed about safety risks and controls and ensure open 

communication with their teams around best practice.

The training module provides personal experiences, views, and advice 
from some of our global senior leaders. By 31 March 2023, 3,910 
assigned leaders had completed the module.

Health and safety governance
Health and safety is managed through a global health and safety 
framework, which includes the monitoring and assessing of risks, setting 
targets, reviewing progress and reporting performance. Our global safety 
framework is based on international standards for occupational health 
and safety. It is aligned to internationally recognised best practice, and 
always meets or exceeds local requirements. In addition, some of our 
local markets have chosen to undergo independent external certification 
to ISO 45001, the international standard for occupational health and 
safety; 57% of our group’s workforce is externally certified to ISO 45001.

All incidents relating to key risks and breaches of the Vodafone Absolute 
Rules are reported and investigated in adherence with timescales 
contained within our Incident Reporting Standard. We ensure that 
incidents are investigated in accordance with their severity, and 
appropriate remedial actions and improvements are identified and 
implemented. We strongly believe in the importance of prevention; 
however, we also believe that every incident should be treated as an 
opportunity for learning and improvement.

Health and safety is a global policy and is included within our global 
risk and compliance governance programme. This year we resumed 
in-country audits, although remote validation continued as a 
complementary process. Our audits focused on fixed networks in 
Germany, Czech Republic, Romania and Albania in response to our key 
risks of working at height and working with electricity and fibre operations. 
Our audits in our _VOIS shared service centres in Egypt focused on 
occupational road risk. Visits were also made to South Africa, Turkey, 
Mozambique, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. These were focused on 
engagement and communication and included a combination of team 
meetings, site visits with contractors and suppliers, meetings with local 
community stakeholders and, where applicable, verification checks 
following any serious incidents.

Employee engagement and consultation in our arrangements for health 
and safety are the foundations of our approach and all markets have 
Health and Safety consultative committees that meet on a regular basis. 
They include elected employee safety representatives, as well as 
representatives from unions and works councils, as appropriate to 
each market.

Training
We continue to include a health and safety module as part of our 
mandatory ‘Doing What’s Right’ training. The training module includes 
a video from our Chief Human Resources Officer demonstrating 
senior-level support for the Vodafone Absolute Rules. Every employee 
must complete the training within six weeks of joining and then follow 
our annual learning intervention cycle. During FY23, 93% of assigned 
Vodafone employees completed the health and safety module. 
Contractors are required to complete separate training relevant to their 
role and position.

Each local market is also responsible for delivering health and safety 
training which supports the development of appropriate safety leadership 
skills, behaviours and identification of health and safety risks. Additional 
training is specific to an individual’s role and aligned to each market’s local 
safety legislation.

Key performance indicators
We have a global set of key performance indicators as part of our safety 
framework, which are reported monthly to the Executive Committee, 
and bi-annually to the Board:

 – Number of fatalities;
 – Number of employee lost time incidents (‘LTI’); and
 – Number of top safety risks, including breaches of our Absolute Rules.

Keeping people safe is one of the most important responsibilities we 

hold as an employer. Our ongoing focus is to provide a safe working 

environment for everyone working for and on behalf of Vodafone and the 

communities in which we operate. We want to ensure that everyone is 

safe when working with and for Vodafone.

Our health and safety framework provides a consistent approach to 

safety leadership, planning, performance monitoring, governance and 

assurance. Our commitment to safety does not differentiate between 

employees, contractors and suppliers, all of whom benefit from the same 

focus on preventing harm, both on worksites and when working or 

moving between sites.

Health and safety risks

We continue to focus on our key health and safety risks, which account 

for the majority of reported incidents and remain a focus area globally: 

occupational road risk, falls from height, and working with electricity 

and fibre.

Road traffic incidents continue to be the primary cause of major injuries 

and fatalities reported globally, accounting for 58% of incidents classified 

as ‘high potential’ during the year. We continue to focus on road safety 

and driver behaviour within our global health and safety strategy and 

operating company plans. In addition, local market road risk controls are 

reviewed as part of our internal assurance plans.

In recognition of our key health and safety risks, we established the 

‘Vodafone Absolute Rules’. These rules focus on risks that present the 

greatest potential for harm for anyone working for or on behalf of 

Vodafone. The Absolute Rules apply everywhere we work and provide 

clear expectations for safe behaviour for everyone to follow. The Absolute 

Rules must be followed by all Vodafone employees and contractors, as 

well as our suppliers’ employees and contractors. Where this requirement 

is not met, we take appropriate management actions. In the September 

2022 Spirit Beat survey, 94% of employees agreed that the Absolute 

Rules are taken seriously at Vodafone.

Leadership engagement

Our Executive Committee and operating company executive committees 

provide visible and clear leadership in health and safety. These senior 

leaders are actively engaged and carry out regular face-to-face site tours 

throughout the year as they recognise the importance of connecting with 

teams and critical workers as they continue to maintain our networks, 

work in our retail stores and on customer sites. We ensure everyone has 

access to senior leadership support in health and safety matters, as this 

is critical to encouraging people to voice any concerns.

We also launched our mandatory ‘Leading for Health & Safety at Work’ 

e-learning module. This module sets out the specific impact we expect 

our leaders to have, such as:

The training module provides personal experiences, views, and advice 

from some of our global senior leaders. By 31 March 2023, 3,910 

assigned leaders had completed the module.

Health and safety governance

Health and safety is managed through a global health and safety 

framework, which includes the monitoring and assessing of risks, setting 

targets, reviewing progress and reporting performance. Our global safety 

framework is based on international standards for occupational health 

and safety. It is aligned to internationally recognised best practice, and 

always meets or exceeds local requirements. In addition, some of our 

local markets have chosen to undergo independent external certification 

to ISO 45001, the international standard for occupational health and 

safety; 57% of our group’s workforce is externally certified to ISO 45001.

All incidents relating to key risks and breaches of the Vodafone Absolute 

Rules are reported and investigated in adherence with timescales 

contained within our Incident Reporting Standard. We ensure that 

incidents are investigated in accordance with their severity, and 

appropriate remedial actions and improvements are identified and 

implemented. We strongly believe in the importance of prevention; 

however, we also believe that every incident should be treated as an 

opportunity for learning and improvement.

Health and safety is a global policy and is included within our global 

risk and compliance governance programme. This year we resumed 

in-country audits, although remote validation continued as a 

complementary process. Our audits focused on fixed networks in 

Germany, Czech Republic, Romania and Albania in response to our key 

risks of working at height and working with electricity and fibre operations. 

Our audits in our _VOIS shared service centres in Egypt focused on 

occupational road risk. Visits were also made to South Africa, Turkey, 

Mozambique, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. These were focused on 

engagement and communication and included a combination of team 

meetings, site visits with contractors and suppliers, meetings with local 

community stakeholders and, where applicable, verification checks 

following any serious incidents.

Employee engagement and consultation in our arrangements for health 

and safety are the foundations of our approach and all markets have 

Health and Safety consultative committees that meet on a regular basis. 

They include elected employee safety representatives, as well as 

representatives from unions and works councils, as appropriate to 

each market.

Training

We continue to include a health and safety module as part of our 

mandatory ‘Doing What’s Right’ training. The training module includes 

a video from our Chief Human Resources Officer demonstrating 

senior-level support for the Vodafone Absolute Rules. Every employee 

must complete the training within six weeks of joining and then follow 

our annual learning intervention cycle. During FY23, 93% of assigned 

Vodafone employees completed the health and safety module. 

Contractors are required to complete separate training relevant to their 

role and position.

Each local market is also responsible for delivering health and safety 

training which supports the development of appropriate safety leadership 

skills, behaviours and identification of health and safety risks. Additional 

training is specific to an individual’s role and aligned to each market’s local 

safety legislation.

Key performance indicators

 – Set high and visible standards for health and safety, and continuously 

challenge others to do the same;

We have a global set of key performance indicators as part of our safety 

framework, which are reported monthly to the Executive Committee, 

 – Build and sustain an authentic, preventative, and caring safety culture;

and bi-annually to the Board:

 – Empower and encourage their teams to take ownership; and

 – Number of fatalities;

 – Be well informed about safety risks and controls and ensure open 

 – Number of employee lost time incidents (‘LTI’); and

communication with their teams around best practice.

 – Number of top safety risks, including breaches of our Absolute Rules.

All fatalities that may be connected with our activities in any way, 
including those affecting employees, suppliers and members of the 
public are formally reported to the Group’s Executive Committee and to 
the Board by the Head of Health, Safety and Wellbeing (‘HSW’). Each 
incident is investigated by an investigation team to determine the facts 
and any actions required to prevent recurrence. The investigation’s 
findings are reviewed by the Chief Human Resources Officer at a formal 
review meeting to ensure the thoroughness of the investigation, 
suitability of corrective and preventive actions and to determine whether 
the fatal accident was within Vodafone’s control or not. All fatalities 
determined to be within Vodafone’s control are considered ‘recordable’ 
and are publicly reported. 

Our aim is to ensure no one gets hurt. Any injury is one too many and any 
loss of life related to our operations is unacceptable. It is therefore with 
great regret that we record a fatality additional to the one reported in the 
prior financial year (FY22), that has since been determined to be within 
Vodafone’s control. In Vodacom South Africa, a supplier’s employee fell 
from height whilst working on a telecoms tower. In response to the 
incident the following actions have been taken:

 – Held forums with employees and suppliers to share experiences and 

improve health and safety awareness;

 – Updated our policies to ensure only specialised suppliers are engaged 
to provide specific tasks, and those suppliers have received relevant 
training and use appropriate equipment; and

 – Updated our working at height training materials and procedures and 
shared these throughout Vodacom South Africa and its suppliers.

There have been no recorded fatalities during FY23.

We track and investigate incidents relating to our top health and safety 
risks and breaches of the Vodafone Absolute Rules. During the year, 
2,059 breaches of Vodafone Absolute Rules and 484 incidents relating 
to our key risks were recorded. Each incident is investigated, and we seek 
to identify the root cause and ensure suitable corrective action is taken 
where necessary. An investigation into each incident is conducted at a 
scale proportionate to the indicative level of risk. By reporting, 
investigating and taking preventive action as a result of these events we 
believe we can continuously reduce the risk of future injury.

Lost-time incident (‘LTI’) is the term we use when an employee is injured 
while carrying out a work-related task and is consequently unable to 
perform their regular duties for a complete shift or period of time after the 
incident. During the year, 19 employee LTIs were reported; three of these 
occurred whilst travelling for work, one occurred in a Vodafone office, 
three occurred in retail, four occurred in a public space, and eight occurred 
on work sites. In total these incidents account for 237 lost workdays.

Mobiles, masts and health
The health and safety of our customers and the wider public has always 
been, and continues to be, a priority for us. Our masts fully comply 
with national regulations, which are typically based on, or go beyond, 
international guidelines set by the independent scientific body, the 
International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (‘ICNIRP’). 
There has been scientific research on mobile frequencies for decades, 
including those used by 5G. If exposure is within national regulations, 
the scientific consensus is that there is no adverse impact on health. 
We continually monitor and evaluate our mobile networks to make sure 
we meet all regulations. In addition, all the products we sell are rigorously 
evaluated to ensure they comply with international safety guidelines.

As well as complying with national regulations, markets that have rolled 
out 5G apply the ‘Smart PowerLock’ (‘SPL’) feature. This innovative 
technology, designed for use with the adaptive antennas used for 5G, 
continuously monitors the transmitted radio frequency power of the 
antenna to ensure it is always below a threshold when averaged 
over a predefined time window. This guarantees compliance with 
electromagnetic field (‘EMF’) regulations under all possible operating 
conditions for 5G sites. This is now one of many software features that are 
routinely activated when a new 5G site is commissioned. SPL also 
includes statistics, that can be used to build evidence of compliance over 
several weeks for a given site if needed by regulators. National regulators 
have accepted the feature as effective.

Science monitoring
Scientific reviews have made a vital contribution to establishing industry 
guidelines and standards. We follow the results of these independent 
expert reviews to understand developments in scientific research related 
to mobile devices, base stations, and health.

In February 2022, an EU-funded scientific study into the effect of mobile 
phone use by children and young people was published. The case study 
was conducted between 2010 and 2015 across 14 countries with more 
than 2,000 participants aged 10-24 years. The study found no evidence 
of a causal association between wireless phone use and brain tumours.

We fund research into mobile devices, base stations, and health through 
funding bodies such as national governments to ensure that the research 
remains independent of industry influence, including our own. We also 
respond to requests from bodies conducting research by providing 
technical advice and information on the use of mobile devices. This helps 
to ensure scientists have access to the best-quality information available.

Harmonisation with international science-based guidelines
Following the opening in 2020 of updated international guidelines on 
electromagnetic frequencies, we have supported and promoted the 
transition from the previous guidelines from 1998 to this more up-to-date 
and appropriate set of guidelines. In EU Member States the EMF regulations 
are set nationally. With the exception of Italy and Greece, which have 
updated their national regulations, our other European markets continue 
to align with the EU Council Recommendation of 1999. We expect that 
this will be updated to reflect the ICNIRP 2020 guidelines.

Click to read more about the ICNIRP 2020 guidelines: 
icnirp.org

Operating model
We have robust governance mechanisms in place and conduct regular 
compliance assessments to ensure that our products meet the standards 
set by the Group policy and national regulations. The Group EMF leadership 
team met four times during the year and submitted written reports to the 
Executive Committee and the Board.

We conduct network measurements and calculations of EMF exposure 
from the network masts and review the test reports we receive on EMF 
testing on devices.

During the year, end-to-end compliance reviews in two of our markets 
verified robust and optimised EMF risk management, and examples 
of best practice are shared across our footprint. All Vodafone markets 
participated in a compliance self-assessment programme with assurance 
provided through our compliance team.

Human rights
We want to make sure that we have a positive impact on people and 
society, which includes respecting human rights in all our operations. 
We are a long-standing member of the UN Global Compact (‘UNGC’) and 
follow the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights (‘UNGP’), which guide our approach.

Our Human Rights Policy Statement details how we do this and is backed 
up by our internal Human Rights Policy which sets out how our people 
must ensure we respect human rights, including steps to take through 
our other aligned policies, such as those covering artificial intelligence, 
responsible minerals, health, safety and wellbeing, human resources, 
privacy management, marketing, business resilience and law 
enforcement assistance.

Human rights risks
As a global telecommunications operator, we connect people. 
This means that our most significant human rights risks relate to our 
customers’ rights to privacy (concerning their data that we safeguard) 
and freedom of expression (in terms of their access to information, 
through the connections we provide). Local laws and regulations can 
mandate that telecommunications operators must provide assistance 
to governments, and we must comply with lawful government requests 
as part of our operating licences. This might include the disclosure of 
customer information or limiting access to digital networks and services. 
However, our internal law enforcement assistance policy guides us in how 
to do this in a rights-respecting way and our transparency reporting 
provides data on certain requests we receive.

The risks to people working in our supply chain are another area of focus 
for us. We manage these risks through our supply chain management 
programme which assesses our suppliers for indicators such as forced 
labour and other risks to human rights, such as health and safety. We 
also believe in supporting the responsible sourcing of minerals globally. 
Although we do not source minerals ourselves, we follow the best 
practice of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to understand whether 
our manufactured products include minerals which have been sourced 
from smelters taking a responsible approach to sourcing.

Our human rights programme also addresses a broader range of 
human rights risks, such as those relating to the design and deployment 
of artificial intelligence, children’s rights, data ethics and risks we may 
become connected with through our broader value chain, such as 
enterprise customers or partner markets.

Our approach
We conduct due diligence to help make sure that we respect human 
rights. Due diligence comes in various forms and at different moments in 
our operations: it may be an independent human rights risk assessment 
for a new market entry, a thematic impact assessment such as the child 
rights assessment completed in FY21, or it may be the ongoing 
assessments we do when considering new partner markets.

The nature of our business also means that we need to keep ahead on 
issues concerning data ethics. For example, this year our Group Data 
Governance Committee approved a new artificial intelligence policy 
to underpin our Artificial Intelligence Framework.

Click to read more about our Artificial Intelligence 
Framework: vodafone.com/ai-framework

We follow up assessments with mitigating actions, such as contractual 
commitments to respect human rights in our partner market agreements, 
and in our enterprise customer contracts. For example, Safaricom Ethiopia 
followed up the human rights impact assessment conducted in February 
2021 with an updated independent assessment and implementation 
programme in FY23. In previous years, we reported that we had 
conducted a child rights assessment, and this year we have continued 
to implement its recommendations. This year, we updated our child 
protection policy by integrating it and including other child rights 
considerations into our internal human rights policy.

We continue to review our processes. For example, this year we have 
reviewed and updated our Code of Ethical Purchasing and we have 
commissioned an independent review of our human rights risks, 
governance and controls. Next year we will report on the outcome 
of the review which we expect to conclude later in 2023.

Anyone who works for us can use Speak Up to raise concerns about 
human rights issues. This year we reviewed Speak Up against the UNGP 
expectations for non-state grievance mechanisms. As a result, we have 
sought to improve the user experience for reporting any human 
rights concerns.

Governance
The Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer oversees our human 
rights programme and is a member of the Executive Committee. 
The senior human rights manager manages our programme, with the 
support of a cross-functional internal Human Rights Advisory Group, 
comprising senior managers responsible for: privacy, security, responsible 
sourcing, and diversity and inclusion, amongst others. This year we have 
set up a community of human rights champions in each of our 
operating companies.

We report regularly on our progress to the Purpose and Reputation 
Steering Committee, which assists the Executive Committee in fulfilling 
duties with regards to our purpose, reputation management and policy. 
This year our ESG Committee reviewed our approach to managing risks 
to freedom of expression and privacy in the context of government 
assistance requests.

Collaboration
We play our part in developing the global understanding of what 
businesses should do to respect human rights. We are a member of 
initiatives such as the United Nations B-Tech Project which convenes 
business, civil society and government to advance implementation of 
the UN Guiding Principles in the technology sector. We were a member 
of the Global Network Initiative ‘GNI’ from 2017. Membership includes a 
requirement to undergo an independent assessment to assess progress 
in implementing the GNI Principles. We successfully completed our first 
GNI independent assessment in 2019, and in 2022 we completed our 
second independent assessment. The multi-stakeholder GNI Board 
considered the independent assessment in detail and determined that 
Vodafone is making good faith efforts to implement the GNI Principles 
on freedom of expression and privacy with improvement over time. 
Following the completion of our 2022 assessment, we chose to leave 
GNI, in order to focus our attention on our broader human rights risks and 
governance and controls at Group level. Simultaneously, Vodacom has 
applied for observer status at GNI to take increased ownership of human 
rights risk management across our Africa footprint.

Responsible supply chain
We spend approximately €25 billion a year with 9,000 direct suppliers 
around the world to meet our business’ and customers’ needs across 
network infrastructure, IT and services related to fixed lines, mobile masts 
and data centres that run our networks.

The majority of our external spend is managed by our Vodafone 
Procurement Company (‘VPC’), based in Luxembourg, and our shared 
services (‘_VOIS’), based in India. Another large area of spend is on the 
products we sell to our customers, including mobile phones, tablets, SIM 
cards, broadband routers, TV set-top boxes and IoT devices. This centralised 
approach helps to ensure that we maintain a consistent approach to 
supplier management across Vodafone, from onboarding and vetting 
a supplier, to raising orders and paying for delivered goods and services.

Supply chain risks
The main risks in our supply chain relate to three key areas; health and 
safety matters related to non-compliant fire safety measures, excessive 
working hours and environmental matters related to non-compliant 
chemical storage and lack of carbon reduction programmes. This year, 
these three risks made up 73% of all non-compliance issues found in our 
supply chain through our assessments. Suppliers that do not meet our 
standards are provided with a corrective action plan to address any areas 
for improvement and are required to submit evidence that this has 
been completed.

Industry collaboration
We work with other operators collaboratively on supply chain risks 
within the Joint Alliance for CSR (‘JAC’) formerly known as the Joint Audit 
Cooperation. We currently chair the JAC working group established to 
improve ethical, labour and environmental standards in the technology 
supply chain. We are engaged in workstreams to make progress on key 
risks in our supply chain, namely human rights, reducing Scope 3 
emissions and driving a circular economy to reduce e-waste.

JAC reports on progress with respect to third-party factory audits 
of common suppliers carried out on behalf of all its members in its 
own reporting.

Policy
This year we updated our Code of Ethical Purchasing to reinforce the 
specific requirements that every supplier that works for Vodafone must 
comply with. These commitments extend down through the supply chain 
so that a supplier with which we have a direct contractual relationship 
(Tier 1 supplier) in turn is required to ensure compliance across its own 
direct supply chain (Tier 2 supplier from Vodafone’s perspective) and 
beyond. The Code of Ethical Purchasing is based on international 
standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Labour Organization’s Fundamental Conventions on Labour 
Standards. It stipulates the social, ethical, and environmental standards 
that we expect, including areas such as child and forced labour, health 
and safety, working hours, discrimination and disciplinary processes.

Click to read our Code of Ethical Purchasing:  
vodafone.com/code-of-ethical-purchasing

Our approach
When new suppliers tender for work, they are asked to demonstrate 
policies and procedures that support safe working, diversity in the 
workplace and to address carbon reduction, renewable energy, plastic 
reduction, circular economy and product life-cycle which account for 
up to 20% of the overall evaluation criteria. Commitments made by our 
suppliers are assessed against our own purpose strategy with respect 
to diversity & inclusion (5%), the environment (5%) and health & safety 
(10%) in categories where there is a safety risk. We have included purpose 
criteria in all FY23 tenders.

We continue to assess risk during our on boarding process by using a 
Supplier Assurance Risk Management (‘SARM’) system to assess key risks 
associated with new suppliers. The system uses logic to identify suppliers 
with risks that are material to our business, related to money laundering, 
bribery, conflict minerals, conflict of interest, corporate security, cyber 
security, environment, health & safety, payment card industry, privacy, 
product safety, responsible sourcing and sanctions & trade control. 
Any identified risks require an independent policy expert to approve 
suppliers before they are on-boarded, and if necessary, to establish 
a mitigation plan. Our requirements are backed up by risk assessments, 
audits and operational improvement processes, which are included 
in suppliers’ contractual commitments.

This year, we launched an improved supplier qualification process which 
uses a risk-based assessment to review compliance for any new suppliers 
across 16 countries. The rollout to remaining operations is subject to 
consultation with the respective workers’ councils.

We report on our approach to preventing modern slavery and human 
trafficking in our business and supply chain in our annual Modern 
Slavery Statement.

Governance
The Chief Financial Officer oversees our supply chain and is a member 
of the Executive Committee and Board. Reporting to the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Chief Executive Officer of the VPC is responsible for the 
implementation of our Code of Ethical Purchasing. Progress is reported 
regularly to the Vodafone Procurement Company Board. Procurement is 
a highly centralised function within the business, with the majority of our 
external spend managed by VPC. This enables us to maintain a consistent 
approach to supplier management and makes it easier to monitor and 
improve supplier performance across our markets.

Business integrity
We are committed to ensuring that our business 
operates ethically, lawfully and with integrity 
wherever we operate as this is critical to our  
long-term success.

Tax and economic contribution
As a major investor, taxpayer and employer, we make a significant 
contribution to the economies of the countries where we operate. 
In addition to direct and indirect taxation, our financial contributions to 
governments also include other areas such as radio spectrum fees and 
spectrum auction proceeds.

Tax transparency
Our most recent tax report sets out our total contribution to public 
finances on a cash-paid basis for both 2021 and 2022. In 2022, we 
contributed, directly and indirectly, nearly €9.9 billion to public finances 
worldwide, compared with almost €9.6 billion in 2021. The year-on-year 
increase was due to higher spectrum payments, principally in Spain 
during 2022. In 2022, we paid over €2.2 billion in direct taxes, including 
more than €1.0 billion in corporate income taxes, nearly €1.7 billion via 
non-taxation based revenue mechanisms, such as payments for the right 
to use spectrum, and collected nearly €6.0 billion of indirect taxes for 
governments around the world.

Responsible business (continued)

Acting with integrity in the creation and execution of our tax strategy, 
policies and practices is absolutely core to our approach to tax, as is our 
commitment to transparency. We disclose our financial contributions 
to governments at a country level, as we believe this is an important way 
to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve an effective balance between 
a company’s responsibilities to society as a whole, through the payment 
of taxes and other government revenue-raising mechanisms, and its 
obligations to its shareholders. The information we share aims to help our 
stakeholders understand our approach, policies, and principles.

We also share our views on key topics of relevance, including the latest 
on the taxation of the digital economy, as well as publishing our OECD 
country-by-country disclosure, as submitted to the UK’s tax authority 
(HMRC), as well as how our disclosures compare to the B Team tax 
principles and the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative.

Our tax report for 2023 will be published by the end of the year, following 
the submission of our tax returns and payment of all applicable taxes.

Anti-bribery, corruption and fraud
At Vodafone, we support and foster a culture of zero tolerance towards 
bribery, corruption or fraud in all our activities.

Our anti-bribery policy
Our policy on this issue is summarised in our Code of Conduct and 
states that employees or others working on our behalf must never offer 
or accept any kind of bribe. Our anti-bribery policy is consistent with the 
UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and provides 
guidance about what constitutes a bribe and prohibits giving or receiving 
any excessive or improper gifts and hospitality. Any policy breaches can 
lead to dismissal or termination of contract.

Click to read our Code of Conduct:  
vodafone.com/code-of-conduct

Facilitation payments are strictly prohibited, and our employees are provided 
with practical training and guidance on how to respond to demands for 
facilitation payments. The only exception is when an employee’s personal 
safety is at risk. In such circumstances, when a payment under duress is made, 
the incident must be reported as soon as possible afterwards.

Risk

Response

We regularly monitor our anti-bribery programme to ensure it is 
implemented through conducting risk assessment, policy compliance 
reviews and internal audits.

To support our approach, Vodafone is also a member of Transparency 
International UK’s Business Integrity Forum.

Governance and risk assessment
Our Group Chief Executive and Executive Committee oversee our efforts 
to prevent bribery. They are supported by local market Chief Executive 
Officers, who are responsible for ensuring that our anti-bribery programme 
is implemented effectively in their local market. They in turn are 
supported by local specialists and by a dedicated Group team that 
is solely focused on anti-bribery policy and compliance. The Risk and 
Compliance Committee assists the Executive Committee in fulfilling 
duties with regards to risk management and policy compliance.

As part of our anti-bribery programme, every Vodafone business must 
adhere to minimum global standards, which include:

 – Ensuring there is a due diligence process for suppliers and business 

partners at the start of the business relationship;

 – Completion of the global e-learning training for all employees, as well 

as tailored training for higher risk teams; and

 – Using Vodafone’s global online gift and hospitality registration 

platform, as well as ensuring there is a process for approving local 
sponsorships and charitable contributions.

The risks we face evolve constantly but broadly fall into the areas 
summarised in the table below, which outlines the principal risk 
categories and the mitigation measures adopted.

Engaging employees to raise awareness of bribery risk
We run a multi-channel high-profile global communications programme, 
‘Doing What’s Right’, to engage with employees and raise awareness 
and understanding of the policy. The ‘Doing What’s Right’ programme 
features e-learning training, including a specific anti-bribery module. 
Of those employees (including management) assigned training during 
the period, 93% had completed the training as at 31 March 2023. 
For higher-risk employees, additional tailored training programmes are 
used to cover relevant scenarios for those employees. We also conduct 
internal communication campaigns using a range of materials to 
highlight some of the key messages around zero tolerance of bribery 
and corruption.

Operating in 
high-risk markets

Business acquisition 
and integration

Spectrum licensing

Building and 
upgrading networks

Working with  
third parties

We undertake biennial risk assessments in each of our local operating companies and at Group, so we can understand and 
limit our exposure to risk. 

Anti-bribery pre and post acquisition due diligence are carried out on a target company. Red flags identified during the due 
diligence process are reviewed and assessed. Following acquisition, we implement our anti-bribery programme. 

To reduce the risk of attempted bribery, a specialist spectrum policy team oversees our participation in all negotiations and 
auctions. We provide appropriate training and guidance for employees who interact with government officials on 
spectrum matters. 

Our anti-bribery policy makes it clear that we never offer any form of inducement to secure a permit, lease or access to a site. 
We regularly remind all employees and contractors in network roles of this prohibition, through tailored training sessions 
and communications. 

Suppliers and other relevant third parties working for or on behalf of Vodafone must comply with the principles set out in our 
Code of Conduct and Code of Ethical Purchasing, as well as have programmes in place to ensure suppliers’ employees and 
contractors are aware of these policies. Third-party due diligence is completed at the start of our business relationship with 
suppliers, other third parties and partners. Through their contracts with us, our suppliers, partners and other third parties 
make a commitment to implement and maintain proportionate and effective anti-bribery compliance measures.

We regularly remind current suppliers of our policy requirements and complete detailed compliance assessments across a 
sample of higher-risk and higher-value suppliers. Select high-risk third parties are trained to ensure awareness of our 
zero-tolerance policy. 

Winning and 
retaining business

We provide targeted training for our Vodafone Business and Partner Markets sales teams. In addition, we also maintain and 
monitor a global register of gifts and hospitality to ensure that inappropriate offers are not accepted or extended by 
our employees.

our employees. 

Assurance
Implementation of the anti-bribery policy is monitored regularly in 
all local markets as part of the annual Group assurance process, which 
reviews key anti-bribery controls. This year we completed our end-to-end 
testing with respect to our businesses in Spain and Mozambique. Further 
to this, self-assessments and quality reviews were completed in Albania, 
Italy, Portugal, DRC, Germany, Ireland and South Africa. We tested key 
high-risk areas of the policy to ensure the markets are implementing the 
controls effectively. The key outcomes from the assurance activities and 
actions for the programme for the coming year are documented in 
the annual assurance paper, which is issued to the Group Risk and 
Compliance Committee.

The results demonstrate good implementation of the Anti-bribery 
programme. The markets demonstrated that they have strong robust 
controls in place to manage bribery risks. A recurring focus area across a 
few markets is third-party risk management; necessary action plans have 
been put in place to improve this area.

Fraud
Fraud is a growing threat globally, impacting customers, reputation, and 
financial performance. The Executive Committee and the Audit and Risk 
Committee have recognised this through significant investment and 
focus on developing a future-ready fraud management capability 
to mitigate the risk of fraud to continue to provide a safe and secure 
environment for our customers.

We successfully implemented a global organisation and operating model, 
including a fraud centre of excellence and shared services infrastructure, 
to manage fraud across local markets, share intelligence, and leverage 
best practices, to ensure quick and effective responses to any incidences 
of fraud that may occur and achieve real-time and proactive fraud 
risk management.

We have invested in advanced fraud detection technologies that leverage 
artificial intelligence capabilities, which have delivered proven benefits 
across Vodafone by helping us detect and manage fraud’s impact 
more effectively.

With the exception of the metrics outlined in the Assurance sheet above, the information contained within the purpose and responsible business 
sections (pages 26 to 49) has not been independently verified or assured. All the information included within these pages has been taken from

ESG cautionary statement
In preparing the ESG-related information contained in this document, we have made a number of key judgements, estimations and assumptions. 
The processes, methodologies and issues involved in preparing this information are complex. The ESG data, models and methodologies used are often 
relatively new, are rapidly evolving and are not necessarily of the same standard as those available in the context of financial and other information, 
nor are they subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. 
It is not possible to rely on historical data as a strong indicator of future trajectories, in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, 
processed data and methodologies may be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess and we expect industry guidance, standards, 
market practice and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. There are also challenges faced in relation to the ability to access certain data on 
a timely basis and the lack of consistency and comparability between data that is available. This means the ESG-related forward-looking statements, 
information and targets discussed in this document carry an additional degree of inherent risk and uncertainty.

Managing uncertainty  
in our business
We face a range of risks and uncertainties that could 
impact the delivery of our strategic initiatives. 
Therefore, our culture and day-to-day management 
of risk is an integral part of the way we do business.

Governance and identifying our risks
On behalf of the Board, the Audit and Risk Committee provides oversight 
for the principal, emerging and watchlist risks, as well as direction on 
risks that the Company is willing to take to achieve its strategic goals. 
The Board approves Vodafone’s strategy and has overall accountability 
that the risk management approach supports this strategy. The aim of the 
risk function is to make risk meaningful and relevant in the context of the 
delivery of our strategy. The risk function acts as an enabler for informed 
decision-making across our markets.

We adopt an end-to-end approach to risk management. The process 
starts with local markets and Group entities identifying and evaluating 
risks which could affect their local strategy. These risks are then assessed 
and challenged centrally by the Group risk team. Next, a comprehensive 
list of these risks is compiled and presented to a selected group of senior 
leaders and executives within the Group, along with the findings from our 
external risk scanning exercise. With a Group-wide perspective in mind, 
these executives analyse and identify the most significant risks that 
require further exploration. The proposed principal risks (pages 52 to 55), 
emerging risks and risk watchlist (page 56) are agreed by our Executive 
Committee (‘ExCo’) before being submitted to the Audit and Risk 
Committee and the Board for scrutiny and approval.

Overview of risk governance structure

Managing our risks
Establishing the context and having a clear understanding of the 
environment in which we operate is important. Therefore, we assign 
each of our risks to a specific category (strategic, operational or financial) 
and identify whether the source of the threat is internal or external. 
This approach helps us to better understand how we should treat the risk 
most effectively and to provide the right level of oversight and assurance. 
Executive risk owners are accountable for confirming adequate controls 
are in place, and that the necessary treatment plans are used to bring 
the risk within an acceptable tolerance level. We continue to monitor 
the status of our risk treatment plans across the year, and we perform 
in-depth reviews of our risks which are presented to the relevant oversight 
committees.

Read more about the Audit and Risk Committee 
on pages 77 to 82

We also develop severe but plausible scenarios for each principal risk. 
These provide additional insights into possible threats and improve 
the treatment strategy. Scenarios are also used for the purpose 
of assessing our viability.

Adverse changes in 
macroeconomic conditions

Description
Adverse changes to economic conditions 
could result in reduced customer spending, 
higher interest rates, adverse inflation, 
currency devaluations or movements in 
foreign exchange rates. Adverse conditions 
could also lead to limited debt refinancing 
options and/or an increase in costs.

Scenario
A severe contraction in economic activity leads 
to lower cash flow generation for the Group 
and disruption in global financial markets, 
which impacts our ability to refinance debt 
obligations as they fall due in a cost 
effective manner.

Emerging factors
Because this is an externally driven risk, the 
threat environment is continually changing. 
External factors such as the ongoing war in 
Ukraine and uncertainty in the banking sector 
could have future impacts on economic 
activity across our markets. The financial 
markets are experiencing high levels of 
volatility, and both sovereign debt levels 
and inflation have reached record levels. 
These factors could lead to a significant 
change in the availability and cost of capital.

Mitigation activities
We have a relatively resilient business model. 
Our offers are competitive in the markets 
in which we operate. We are supporting our 
business customers’ efficiencies through our 
innovative products. We have a long average 
life of debt which reduces refinancing 
requirements, and all of our bond debt 
is effectively held at fixed interest rates. 

By analysing the correlation between risks we can identify those that have the potential to impact 
or increase other risks, to ensure they are weighted appropriately.

This exercise also informs our scenario analysis, particularly the combined scenario used in the 
long-term viability statement.

and disruption in global financial markets, 

which impacts our ability to refinance debt 

obligations as they fall due in a cost

Disintermediation

Cyber threat 

Description
Failure to effectively respond to threats from 
emerging technology or disruptive business 
models could lead to a loss of customer 
relevance, market share and new/existing 
revenue streams.

Description
An external attack, insider threat or supplier 
breach could cause service interruption or 
confidential data breaches. 

Adverse political and policy 
environment

Description
An adverse political and policy environment 
could impact our strategy and result in 
increased costs, create competitive 
disadvantage or have negative impact on our 
return on capital employed.

Scenario
Further developments in mobile handset 
technologies, such as eSIM, could lead to 
an increase in higher customer churn, higher 
costs, and lower revenue.

Emerging factors
In our Consumer segment, the widespread 
introduction of alternative technology 
solutions driving disintermediation could put 
pressure on our core business, while content 
producers seeking to engage directly with 
consumers could increase pressure on our 
TV propositions. In the Business segment, 
technology players could move deeper into 
the telecommunications value chain and look 
to control end-to-end service orchestration. 
Alternative connectivity networks with 
‘free-to-use’ business models may begin to 
appeal to customers across both Consumer 
and Business segments.

Mitigation activities
We are focused on strenghtening relationships 
with our customers through innovative and 
transformative products and services that go 
beyond our leading connectivity propositions. 
We aim to be less complex as an organisation, 
by simplifying our product portfolio, improving 
our operating model, and progressing with our 
digital transformation.

Scenario
We have modelled scenarios including attacks 
on core infrastructure, a bulk data breach 
and loss of major customer-facing systems. 
An example includes threat actors using 
destructive malware to disable our ability 
to service new and existing customers.

Emerging factors
Cyber risk is constantly evolving in line with 
technological and geopolitical developments. 
We anticipate threats will continue from 
existing sources, and also evolve in areas 
such as 5G, IoT, vendor software integrity, 
quantum computing and the use of AI and 
machine learning.

Mitigation activities
We have a risk-based approach to managing 
cyber security. We actively identify risks 
and threats, design layers of control, and 
implement controls across the Group. 
We implement controls that prevent the 
majority of attacks, in addition to controls to 
detect events and respond quickly to 
reduce harm. We perform regular cyber crisis 
simulations with senior management in our 
markets and Group functions using a tailored 
set of scenarios.

approach to cyber security

Scenario
Exposure to additional liabilities and 
reputational damage, triggered by policy 
maker and/or regulatory authority interventions 
were to adversely change in the markets in 
which we operate.

Emerging factors
The war in Ukraine has generated ripple effects 
across the political and macroeconomic 
environment, in particular in Europe but also 
in some of our other markets. This has resulted 
in energy price fluctuations, accentuated 
inflation and worsened a cost of living crisis, 
requiring us to adapt accordingly. Goverments’ 
responses to these challenges may also 
impact on our business. Also, geopolitical 
tensions are increasing which amplifies the 
risk of protectionist responses, or other forms 
of state interventions and security-related 
requirements that could affect our operations, 
supply chains and conditions for competition 
in various ways.

Mitigation activities
We actively scan the external horizon, gather 
intelligence to inform decision-making and 
address issues openly with policymakers, 
regulatory authorities, customers and 
impacted stakeholders to find mutually 
acceptable ways forward. As a last resort, 
we uphold our rights through legal means.

Description
Failure to effectively execute our 
transformational activities, including shaping 
our portfolio and delivering on product 
innovation, could result in loss of business 
value and/or additional cost. 

Description
Disruption in our supply chain could mean that 
we are unable to execute our strategic plans, 
resulting in increased cost, reduced choice and 
lower network quality.

Description
Network, system, or platform outages, or 
ineffective execution of the technology

Scenario
We are not an active participant in in-market 
consolidation in key markets and do not 
benefit from the resulting synergies, or we 
are adversely impacted by market remedies 
imposed by regulators following in-market 
consolidation.

Emerging factors
Macroeconomic conditions, such as the 
current inflationary environment, may impact 
our transformational efforts. In addition, no 
change in the regulators’ approach to 
in-market consolidation may limit opportunities 
for value accretive in-market consolidation.

Mitigation activities
In relation to shaping our portfolio, we actively 
monitor and pursue opportunities to optimise 
our portfolio to deliver value for our 
shareholders and improve returns. We actively 
assess opportunities to i) generate and realise 
value from our assets; ii) deliver value accretive 
in-market consolidation to deliver sustainable 
market structures; and iii) streamline and 
simplify our portfolio.

We are prioritising our efforts on three key 
areas: customers, simplicity and growth. 
To enable that, we have robust policies and 
governance structures in place, such as our 
Global Product Board, dedicated to steering 
our transformation efforts and ensuring 
we execute at scale. Lastly, we have been 
transforming our approach to product 
management to become more agile. 

Scenario
Political decisions affecting our ability to use 
equipment from specific vendors could cause 
trade and supply chain disruptions.

Emerging factors
Changes in the political landscape outside 
Vodafone’s control (for example, US and China 
tensions or long-term impacts from the war in 
Ukraine) may significantly impact the upgrade 
and maintenance of our network, or impact 
product availability. Disruption may lead to an 
increase in our costs from areas such as raw 
material prices, energy costs, and shipping 
costs, while at the same time, triggering 
shortages or extended lead times for critical 
components. Additionally, economic instability 
might impact our suppliers’ ability to deliver.

Mitigation activities
We are closely monitoring the evolution of 
the geopolitical environment. This enables us 
to respond to emerging challenges and to 
comply with regulations, economic sanctions 
and trade rulings. We also mitigate our 
exposure through having multi-year contracts 
with key suppliers, forecasting and forward 
ordering our inventory requirements in 
anticipation of extended lead-times as well 
as continuing to execute our logistics 
optimisation strategy for networks 
infrastructure logistics.

Scenario
A major outage in a critical data centre or a 
failed IT transformation activity could reduce 
service to customers, affecting revenue 
and reputation.

Emerging factors
Due to the time frame to implement large IT 
transformation programmes, macroeconomic 
conditions and customer expectations 
might change for in-progress programmes. 
Extreme weather events may increase the 
likelihood or frequency of technology failure. 
Additionally, deliberate attacks on national 
critical infrastructure could increase during 
war or volatile periods.

Mitigation activities
Recovery targets for critical assets are 
established to limit the impact of service 
outages. A global policy outlines the controls 
required to ensure that technology services 
are resilient and in alignment with these 
targets. We prioritise IT transformation and 
modernisation programmes to address specific 
technology resilience risks, while also 
supporting business process and portfolio 
simplification. IT transformation programmes 
carry risks of scope creep and cost overruns, 
therefore we are increasingly using an 
incremental delivery approach to be able to 
realise benefits and adapt faster while applying 
tight governance.

Description
Data breaches, misuse of data, data

reputational damage, loss of value, loss of 
business opportunity, and failure to meet our 
customers’ expectations.

Financial Controller

Scenario
Failure to manage the privacy of our 
stakeholders’ data effectively and compliantly 
could result in regulatory fines, paying 
significant reparation of damages to impacted 
individuals, and also reputational damage that 
could result in higher churn rates.

Emerging factors
Proliferation of Artificial Intelligence and 
related regulator and legislative action across 
our footprint requires a robust ethics and 
compliance approach. Geopolitisation of data 
will continue to negatively impact cross border 
data transfers. New European data regulations, 
such as the Artificial Intelligence Act or the 
Cyber Act, will introduce significant new legal 
requirements around data management of our 
business activities.

Mitigation activities
We process data ethically, with integrity, 
securely, and always consistently with 
applicable laws and our values. We are known 
for our robust approach to privacy and strike 
the right balance between business objectives 
and customer and regulatory expectations. 
We manage this through various privacy and 
data management specific policies and related 
controls, measured by a global control 
effectiveness target for each related control 
and underpinned with mandatory 
training programmes.

Description
Significant activity by competition, such as 
price wars, new market entrants or business 
practices, may lead to reduced margins and 
market share, and increased customer churn.

Description
Failure to effectively execute on our goal to 
simplify our organisation and operating model 
could result in reduced speed of decision-
making and delivery, reduced clarity on 
accountabilities, and higher cost.

Officer

Scenario
Aggressive pricing, accelerated customer 
losses to low value players on mobile and 
fixed, and disruptive new market entrants in 
key European markets could result in greater 
customer churn and pricing pressures, 
impacting our financial position. In addition, 
high inflation levels and low confidence in 
economic outlook could have further impact.

Emerging factors
While emerging factors often depend on 
individual market structures and the 
competitive landscape, external factors such 
as the confidence in global economic systems, 
record high inflation, the ongoing war in 
Ukraine and slow post-pandemic economic 
recovery in many markets may impact 
household and individual connectivity spend.

Mitigation activities
We closely monitor the competitive 
environment in all markets and react 
accordingly to both consumer and business 
needs. We continue to evolve our tariffs and 
offers to provide a differentiated customer 
experience through benefits, such as flexible 
contract terms, refurbished devices and social 
tariffs. In addition, in many markets we utilise 
‘second’ brands to compete more effectively 
and efficiently in the value segment.

Scenario
Unsuccessful attempts to drive organisational 
simplicity could result in lower employee 
engagement, higher talent attrition and failure 
to become a more efficient organisation.

Emerging factors
The increase in changes within the internal 
organisation and external macroeconomic 
environment requires all employees to show 
Spirit behaviours. As our customers’ needs and 
expectations change, we might have to adapt 
or change our simplification agenda to meet 
and exceed their requirements.

Mitigation activities
We have a clear organisational strategy 
of simplification, which underpins the delivery 
of operational excellence and employee 
engagement, measured in our Spirit Beat 
survey annually. Robust communication plans 
and employee engagement activities 
throughout periods of change are further 
mitigation activities to encourage talent 
retention and engagement. We have specialist 
teams managing our organisation 
simplification agenda, working with leaders 
to design and embed changes. We also have 
governance structures, sponsored by the 
Executive Committee in place to align on 
potential changes while considering their 
implications, risks and mitigating actions 
across all relevant dimensions.

Risk management (continued)

Tax
Tax risk covers our management of tax across the markets in which we 
operate and how we respond to changes in tax law, which may have an 
impact on the Group. We have controls in place to govern each of these 
areas in line with our tax principles.

Read more about our tax risk and our approach to tax and our 
economic contribution on pages 47 to 48

Emerging risks
We face a number of uncertainties where an emerging risk may 
potentially impact us. In some cases, there may be insufficient information 
to understand the likelihood, impact, or velocity of the risk. Also, we might 
not be able to fully define a mitigation plan until we have a better 
understanding of the threat.

We continue to identify new emerging risk trends, using inputs from 
analysis of the external environment and internal sources. We evaluate 
our risks across different time periods, allowing us to provide the 
appropriate level of focus on these emerging risks.

We work with the relevant experts across the business to assess the 
potential impacts and time horizon of these risks. Our emerging risks, 
within predefined risk categories, are provided to the Executive 
Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee for further scrutiny.

Strengthening our framework
We continue to enhance and embed the global risk management 
framework with the objective of maturing our approach. This promotes 
consistency across all the markets in which we operate.

Over the course of the year, we have:

 – Developed a risk knowledge and skills matrix for our risk 

management community;

 – Enhanced reporting to our governance committees, which allows for 

better decision-making;

 – Performed a Group-wide risk awareness campaign in an effort to 

enhance our risk culture; and

 – Completed a cross-functional analysis of our operational resilience 

capabilities to identify gaps and areas for enhancements.

Key changes to our principal risks:
 – The Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions principal 

risk has increased. We constantly monitor the economic 
repercussions of the war in Ukraine and the effects of sovereign 
debt build-up during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors 
contribute to an uncertain outlook.

 – The Disintermediation principal risk has increased as we consider 
the impacts of alternative technologies being developed/deployed 
in the near future.

 – The Data management and privacy risk was added to the 

principal risks from watchlist risk, as we continue to face increasing 
scrutiny from regulators, investors and customers.

 – As Vodafone continues to transform and simplify, we have included 

Organisational simplification as a new principal risk.

 – The Strategic transformation principal risk scope was redefined. 

The new scope includes the portfolio transformation risk (a 
previous principal risk), the management of joint ventures, as well 
as product innovation. The digital transformation sub-risk was 
removed from this risk.

 – The Infrastructure competitiveness risk was moved to our 

watchlist risks (see section below). 

Watchlist risks
Our watchlist risk process enables us to monitor material risks to 
Vodafone Group which fall outside our principal risks. These include, 
but are not limited to:

Legal compliance
The legal compliance risk is made up of multiple sub-risks (sanctions and 
trade controls, competition law, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering). 
Controls are in place to monitor and manage these risks and ensure 
compliance with the relevant regulations and legislation.

Electromagnetic field (‘EMF’)
The health and safety of our customers and the wider public has always 
been, and continues to be, a priority for us. We refer to the current body 
of scientific evidence so that the services and products we provide are 
within prescribed safety limits and adhere to all relevant standards and 
national laws.

 – The Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions principal 

risk has increased. We constantly monitor the economic 

repercussions of the war in Ukraine and the effects of sovereign 

debt build-up during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors 

contribute to an uncertain outlook.

 – The Disintermediation principal risk has increased as we consider 

the impacts of alternative technologies being developed/deployed 

in the near future.

 – The Data management and privacy risk was added to the 

principal risks from watchlist risk, as we continue to face increasing 

scrutiny from regulators, investors and customers.

 – As Vodafone continues to transform and simplify, we have included 

Organisational simplification as a new principal risk.

 – The Strategic transformation principal risk scope was redefined. 

The new scope includes the portfolio transformation risk (a 

previous principal risk), the management of joint ventures, as well 

as product innovation. The digital transformation sub-risk was 

removed from this risk.

 – The Infrastructure competitiveness risk was moved to our 

watchlist risks (see section below). 

Our watchlist risk process enables us to monitor material risks to 

Vodafone Group which fall outside our principal risks. These include, 

Watchlist risks

but are not limited to:

Legal compliance

trade controls, competition law, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering). 

Controls are in place to monitor and manage these risks and ensure 

compliance with the relevant regulations and legislation.

Long-term viability statement (‘LTVS’)

The preparation of the LTVS includes an assessment of the Group’s 
long-term prospects in addition to an assessment of the ability to meet 
future commitments and liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
review period.

Assessment of viability
The Board has chosen a three-year period to assess Vodafone 
Group’s viability. This is the period in which we believe our principal risks 
tend to develop. This time horizon is also in line with the structure of 
long-term management incentives and the outputs from the long range 
business planning cycle. We continue to conduct financial stress testing 
and sensitivity analysis, considering revenue at risk.

The viability assessment started with the available headroom as of 31 
March 2023 and considered the plans and projections assembled as part 
of the forecasting cycle, which include the Group’s cash flows, planned 
commitments, required funding, and other key financial ratios. We also 
assumed that debt refinancing will remain available in all plausible 
market conditions.

Finally, we estimated the impact of severe but plausible scenarios for 
all our principal risks on the three-year plan. We also stress tested a 
combined scenario taking into account the risk interdependencies as 
defined in the diagram on page 52, where the following risks were 
modelled as materialising in parallel over the three-year period:

Cyber threat: A cyber-attack exploits vulnerabilities allowing 
unauthorised access to our systems, or a ransomware attack, impacting 
our ability to service customers for an extended period of time.

Data management and privacy: A data breach, through malicious 
activities (e.g. cyber-attack), leading to an investigation and a 
subsequent GDPR fine.

Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions: Adverse changes in 
the macroeconomic environment could result in restricted ability to 
refinance, while prolonged high inflation rates, may lead to increased 
interest rates.

Adverse political and policy measures: Adverse political and policy 
interventions could lead to increased cost of operations, and directly 
or indirectly reduce profitability.

Assessment of long-term prospects
The Board undertakes a robust review and challenge of the strategy and 
assumptions. Each year the Board conducts a strategy session, reviewing 
the internal and external environment as well as significant threats and 
opportunities to the sustainable creation of long-term shareholder value 
(note that known emerging threats related to each principal risk are 
described on pages 52 to 55).

As an input to the strategy discussion, the Board considers the principal 
risks (including Cyber threat, Data management and privacy, Adverse 
changes in macroeconomic conditions, and Adverse political and policy 
measures) with the focus on identifying underlying opportunities and 
setting the Group’s future strategy. The output from this session is 
reflected in the strategic section of the Annual Report (page 7), which 
provides a view of the Group’s long-term prospects.

Conclusions
The Board assessed the prospects and viability of the Group in 
accordance with provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
considering the Group’s strategy and business model, and the principal 
risks to the Group’s future performance, solvency, liquidity and 
reputation. The assessment takes into account possible mitigating 
actions available to management were any risk or combination 
of risks to materialise.

Cash and cash equivalents available of €11.6 billion (page 170) as of 
31 March 2023, along with options available to reduce cash outgoings 
over the period considered, provide the Group with sufficient positive 
headroom in all scenarios tested. Reverse stress testing on revenue and 
adjusted EBITDAaL over the review period confirmed that the Group has 
sufficient headroom available to face uncertainty. The Board deemed 
the stress test conducted to be adequate, and therefore confirmed that 
it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will remain in operation 
and be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due up to 31 March 2026.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

TCFD disclosure
We recognise that climate change poses a 
number of physical (i.e. extreme weather events) 
and transition-related (i.e. related to moving to a 
greener economy) risks and opportunities for our 
business. As part of our commitment to operate 
ethically and sustainably, we strive to understand 
climate-related risks and opportunities and embed 
responses to these into our business strategy and 
operations. We have been aligning our internal 
processes with the recommendations of the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(‘TCFD’) and will continue to enhance our 
policies, processes and reporting with respect 
to the TCFD recommendations. Our progress 
is summarised in this section.

TCFD recommendations
For the year ending 31 March 2023, we are consistent with 10 out of 11 
TCFD recommendations. There is one recommendation with which we 
are currently partially consistent:

Metrics and targets (physical risks): We measure and have set 
ambitious targets for reducing our carbon emissions. We also have 
metrics in place to measure our energy use, which is one underlying 
factor in our exposure to transition risk. As a measure of the climate 
opportunity associated with developing and deploying products to help 
society decarbonise, we also report annually on the carbon emissions 
avoided through the use of green digital solutions. This year, we also 
began measuring our physical risk exposure and management based 
on the number of infrastructure assets that are at high or very high risk 
of climate impacts such as extreme weather events. Whilst these are 
important steps forward on our climate-related risk disclosure journey, 
we recognise that we do not yet have metrics and targets in place to 
measure our full suite of climate risks.

Our disclosure this year improves upon our position in 2022, when we 
were only consistent with eight out of 11 recommendations. In this 
year’s report, we are pleased to include further detail on the impact 
of climate-related risks and opportunities on our business strategy and 
financial planning, and a quantitative measure of the number of assets 
at high or very high risk of physical climate change. As industry practices 
evolve and our internal programme matures, we aim to address the 
remaining gaps in our climate-related risk management and reporting 
approach over the next three years. 

TCFD reporting
As with last year’s disclosure, we have once again published our 
comprehensive TCFD overview in a standalone report. This enables us 
to provide more detailed information for investors and other interested 
stakeholders in a more accessible format.

Governance
Our strategy is approved by the Board which has reviewed Vodafone’s 
purpose and Planet commitments to reduce our environmental impact, 
such as reaching ‘net zero’ emissions across our full value chain (Scope 1, 
2 and 3) by 2040. The Board’s Audit and Risk Committee has oversight 
of our climate-related risks and opportunities. In addition, the ESG 
Committee provides oversight of the broader ESG strategy.

Read more about the ESG Committee  
on pages 83 to 84

The Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer, a member of the 
Executive Committee, is the sponsor for the Planet agenda as part of our 
purpose-led strategy and has overall accountability for climate change 
action within the Group. This includes providing updates to the Board on 
the progress towards our climate-related goals. The Chief Network Officer 
is responsible for the overall management of the physical risks to Vodafone 
due to the nature of our business.

In addition, our Remuneration Policy incorporates our ESG priorities in 
the long-term incentive plan. For the 2023 award, the ESG measure under 
the long-term incentive plan includes an ambition on planet linked to 
our aim of reaching net zero for our own operations under Scope 1 
and 2 by 2030.

Strategy
This year, we once again conducted our annual exercise to refresh the 
assessment of the top climate-related risks and opportunities to ensure 
we are incorporating any change in climate trends or science, as well as 
new risks and opportunities. The exercise confirmed that the identified 
risks and opportunities remain largely unchanged from the previous 
assessment, although some require more attention in the short term due 
to the macroeconomic environment and volatility in the energy market.

Last year, we built on our previous climate scenario work and considered 
our resilience against key climate-related risks and opportunities. 
That work included mapping the current controls in place and the 
strength of those controls for each material risk and opportunity. 
Overall, we have controls in place for all identified key risks and this 
helps us build resilience against the potential impacts on the business.

Physical risks are assessed and considered throughout the critical 
stages of the asset lifecycle. Environmental risks are assessed ahead 
of the acquisition of buildings and network equipment. We have teams 
and processes dedicated to disaster recovery and business continuity. 
In addition, we mitigate the financial impact of physical risks through 
insurance and damage response.

Our broader Planet strategy, targets and external communications are 
designed to manage and mitigate the potential impacts of transition risks 
on the Group. We have specialist teams that monitor and drive progress 
to maintain and meet expectations from key stakeholders. This year, 
we took further steps to improve energy efficiency and limit exposure to 
energy market volatility as it is a key short-term risk. Similarly, harnessing 
our current climate and ESG strategy and monitoring market trends 
will enable us to also capture opportunities arising from the 
low-carbon transition.

Read more about how our products and services help 
our customers reduce their emissions on page 37

This year, we also conducted a scenario analysis focusing on the potential 
impact of physical climate-related risks on specific types of our 
infrastructure assets, with the aim of understanding how our infrastructure 
asset portfolio is expected to evolve in the long term under different 
climate change scenarios. This exercise will inform our longer-term 
resilience plans related to physical climate-related risks, such as damage 
to our infrastructure.

Risk management
We have aligned our climate-related risk management process with our 
overall risk management framework. Climate change was discussed and 
considered during the principal risk assessment process and it was once 
again placed on our risk watchlist.

Read more about our risk management framework  
on pages 51 to 52 and 56

To ensure a robust identification and assessment of climate-related risks 
and opportunities we use the following data sources:

 – Climate-change publications and data;
 – Guidance from the TCFD on potential risks and opportunities;
 – Previous year’s assessments; and
 – Key stakeholders’ inputs via a survey and targeted discussions.

We evaluate the materiality of the identified risks and opportunities by 
assessing their likelihood and impact using our global risk management 
framework. This process helps us determine the relative significance 
of the climate-related risks in relation to other risks.

Due to the nature of the topic, there are many teams across Vodafone 
that are responsible for managing climate-related risks and we have 
multiple processes and policies in place to ensure we are managing 
them effectively.

Metrics and targets
We use a wide variety of metrics to measure the current and potential 
impacts of climate-related risks. We have been measuring and reporting 
on energy and carbon emissions since 2001 and have been responding 
to CDP’s climate change questionnaire since 2010. Our main carbon 
emissions metrics are also subject to independent limited assurance. 
In addition, we have set a number of targets to manage climate-related 
risks and reduce our impact on the environment, such as reaching ‘net 
zero’ emissions across our full value chain (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2040 and 
purchasing 100% renewable electricity in all markets by 2025. Since July 
2021, our European network has been 100% powered by electricity from 
renewable sources.

Click to download our ESG Addendum: 
investors.vodafone.com/esgaddendum

We constantly seek to refresh and improve our metrics and key risk 
indicators to better measure and manage climate-related risks and 
opportunities. We recognise that we need to mature further in this 
area as industry practices and better-quality data become available.

Read more about our existing environmental KPIs  
on pages 35 to 38

Material climate-related risks and opportunities
Physical risks:
 – Damage to infrastructure caused by increasing frequency and 

severity of extreme weather events, including wildfires, flooding, 
and storms

 – Interruption or reduction in the quality of services due to increased 

precipitation and extreme weather events

 – Supply chain disruption due to climate impacts on key suppliers
 – Increases in global temperatures leading to an increase in the 

consumption of energy for cooling

Transition risks:
 – Increasing stakeholder scrutiny over our environmental 

performance impacting revenue, market share and reputation

 – Rising price of energy (renewable and non-renewable)
 – Emerging carbon regulations and carbon taxation
 – Changing mandates and regulations over infrastructure 

energy efficiency

 – Third-party dependency impacting our ability to meet carbon 

targets and improve efficiencies

Opportunities:
 – Development of new product lines enabling customers to better 

manage climate-related impacts

 – Reduced costs through sustainable procurement

improvements had been achieved in:

 – Appointing four new Non-Executive Directors, 

each bringing extensive technology and 

telecommunications experience;

 – devoting more time to strategy by holding 

several strategic deep-dive sessions during the 

year to enhance free-flowing discussions; and

 – establishing a Board sub-committee to 

consider mergers and acquisitions (‘M&A’) 

transactions.

The Nominations and Governance Committee regularly reviews the Board’s composition with a view 

to ensuring a diverse mix of backgrounds, skills, knowledge and experience as well as deep expertise 

in technology and telecommunications. Each year, the Board monitors and improves its performance 

by conducting an annual performance review. 

Committee activities

To operate efficiently and to ensure matters are given the right level of focus, the Board delegates 
some of its responsibilities to its Committees. These provide focused oversight on: Board composition, 
performance, and succession planning; financial reporting, risk, internal processes and controls; 
remuneration practices; and environmental, sustainability and governance topics. 

Nominations and Governance Committee
In addition to keeping under review developments in corporate 
governance and the Company’s responses to them, the Nominations and 
Governance Committee makes recommendations to the Board about 
Board composition and ensures Board diversity and the necessary 
balance of skills. The Committee recognises the need to anticipate the 
skills and attributes that will be needed on the Board as the Company 
develops. A key focus for the Committee this year has been Board and 
Executive Committee composition. For the latter half of the year, the main 
activity has concerned succession planning for the Group Chief Executive.

Chair’s governance statement

We take seriously our commitment to strong and 
robust corporate governance

Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report for the year 
ended 31 March 2023 on behalf of the Board.

The year in review
This year, has again, been one of change and I am grateful to my fellow 
Directors, the executive team, and the people of Vodafone for their 
support, flexibility, and strong spirit throughout.

In spite of the challenges faced we have functioned well and have 
continued to take seriously our commitment to strong and robust 
corporate governance to support the creation of long-term sustainable 
value for the benefit of all our stakeholders.

This report provides details about the Board and an explanation of our 
individual roles and responsibilities as well as providing an insight into the 
activities of the Board and Committees over the year and how we seek to 
ensure the highest standards of corporate governance remain embedded 
throughout the Company, underpinning and supporting our business and 
the decisions we make.

Board succession
Executive Directors
During the year, the Board and Nominations and Governance Committee 
reviewed the future leadership of the Company and, as announced on 5 
December 2022, the Board agreed with Nick Read that he would step down 
as Group Chief Executive and as a Director of the Company on 31 
December 2022. I would like to thank Nick for his commitment and 
significant contribution to Vodafone as Group Chief Executive and 
throughout his career spanning more than two decades with the Company.

In addition to her role as Group Chief Financial Officer, Margherita Della 
Valle was appointed Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2023 
on an interim basis. The Board initiated a process with the support of Egon 
Zehnder, an independent external search firm, to find a permanent Group 
Chief Executive and on 27 April 2023, we announced the permanent 
appointment of Margherita Della Valle. The Board and I have been 
impressed with her pace and decisiveness to begin the necessary 
transformation of Vodafone. Tasked with accelerating the execution of 
the Company’s strategy to improve operational performance and deliver 
shareholder value the Board fully supports her. Margherita will also 
continue as Group Chief Financial Officer until an external search for 
a new Group Chief Financial Officer is complete.

Non-Executive Directors
The Board, together with the Nominations and Governance Committee, 
has continued to monitor the composition and skills matrix of the Board 
with a focus on succession planning for our Non-Executive Directors.

Last year we indicated several upcoming scheduled retirements from 
the Board and on 10 May 2023 we announced that Valerie Gooding, 
Sir Crispin Davis and Dame Clara Furse would not be seeking re-election 
at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). At the date of publication, 
Valerie Gooding has served more than nine years as a Director; however, 
she will remain on the Board until the conclusion of the 2023 AGM in 
order to allow for a gradual and smooth transition period of the Senior 
Independent Director role to David Nish, Remuneration Committee Chair 
role to Amparo Moraleda and Workforce Engagement Lead roles to 
Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Christine Ramon. Following evaluation, 
Valerie is still considered independent.

In anticipation of these retirements, there have been a number of Board 
changes during the year, with the appointment of four new Non-Executive 
Directors, Stephen Carter, Delphine Ernotte Cunci, Simon Segars and 
Christine Ramon. I am delighted to welcome them to Vodafone’s Board. 
Their appointments bring extensive experience and track records of 
value creation across a variety of sectors which will be of great support 
to the Group.

A full induction programme is underway for the new Non-Executive Directors, 
including meetings with executives leading our businesses and functions.

Read more about the appointment process  
on page 74

Board diversity
We remain firmly committed to having a Board that is diverse in all 
respects. With support from the Nominations and Governance 
Committee, we continue to monitor requirements and are proud to meet 
these including the target that at least 40% of the Board is composed 
of women. This includes our Group Chief Executive and Group Chief 
Financial Officer, Margherita Della Valle and our Senior Independent 
Director, Valerie Gooding. We have also met the Parker Review target to 
have at least one Director from a non-white ethnic minority.

Read more about our Board Diversity Policy  
on page 75

Beyond the Board, we announced last year the introduction of a new 
ethnic diversity target that 25% of global senior leadership will come from 
ethnically diverse backgrounds by 2030.

Read more  
on page 34

Board evaluation
This year the Board undertook an internal evaluation led by myself 
with support from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. 
I am pleased to report the findings show there is clear consensus that 
the Board is operating well with effective leadership and where open 
discussion and input from all members is encouraged. Positive feedback 
was also received on the composition of the Board and the conduct 
of meetings and materials provided. Some areas for improvement were 
identified and we will look to progress these during the year ahead.

Read more  
on page 73

Continued stakeholder engagement
We recognise that Vodafone’s success is dependent on the Board taking 
decisions for the benefit of our shareholders and in doing so having 
regard to all our stakeholders.

Throughout the year, I have interacted with institutional shareholders and 
engaged on topics such as the Company’s strategy, Board and Executive 
changes, and succession plans. I was delighted that as well as virtual 
meetings, we were able to host some meetings in person for the first time 
since the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board has also received updates on 
the investor perception study completed during the year.

In her role as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, Valerie Gooding 
engaged with shareholders on the proposed updates to the Remuneration 
Policy and remuneration arrangements in respect of the forthcoming year.

on page 85

Valerie Gooding also continued to serve as the Board’s Workforce 
Engagement Lead, gathering the views of employees through a number 
of employee consultative committees across all our European and 
African markets. Key discussion topics from this year’s meetings included 
‘Future Ready Vodafone’ ways of working, the ‘Grow with Vodafone’ 
personal development platform, economic uncertainty and the Race, 
Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage (‘REACH’) targets.

The Board understands the importance of culture and setting the tone

We refer to our culture as the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’. It is a key component 
for our strategic, organisational and digital transformation. The aim of our 
people strategy is to create an environment where growing never stops 
and everyone can truly belong, innovate, and fulfil their potential. We 
continue to hold quarterly ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ days for our employees, 
designed to provide dedicated space for personal growth, wellbeing and 
connection. The Board receives regular updates on employee engagement 
and the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’, which enables it to make informed 
decisions where appropriate.

The year ahead
On 10 May 2023, the Board approved the creation of a Technology 
Committee as a new Board Committee. Once established, during the 
course of this year, the Committee will oversee the technology strategy 
and how it supports the overall Company strategy. Further information 
on this Committee will be shared in next year’s report. 

A key focus for myself and the Board will be completing the appointment 
process for a new Group Chief Financial Officer and supporting that 
individual as they step into the role alongside Margherita Della Valle.

In addition, the Board will continue to drive for better returns for 
shareholders and will monitor the Company’s progress on the execution 
of Vodafone’s strategy focusing on Customers, Simplicity and Growth. The 
Board will keep the Group’s strategy under review, adapting it to anticipate 
or respond to opportunities and risks in the markets in which we operate.

Our Company purpose, values and culture 

Purpose
At Vodafone, our purpose is to connect for a better future by enabling 
inclusive and sustainable digital societies and it is supported by our three 
purpose pillars: Digital Society, Inclusion for All and Planet. Our purpose 
is championed by our Board, which is collectively responsible for the 
oversight and long-term success of the Company. It is aligned with our 
culture and strategy, placed at the forefront of our decision-making and 
strategy development, and the Board considers how the initiatives 
progressed by management throughout the year have advanced our 
purpose. Board oversight ensures that continued product development 
realises our ambition to connect for a better future.

Strategy
The Board monitors the Company’s progress against established strategic 
objectives and performance against competitors. Board meetings are 
planned with reference to the Company’s strategic priorities and meeting 
agendas are constructed to deliver information at appropriate junctures 
and from a broad range of management, to enable the Board to 
effectively review and challenge.

on page 7

Governance
The Board ensures the highest standard of corporate governance 
is maintained by regularly reviewing developments in governance 
best practice and ensuring these are adopted by the Company.

The Board dedicated time during the year to thoroughly consider the 
independence and time commitment of all Directors, the arrangements 
in place to monitor conflicts of interest, as well as evaluating the 
effectiveness of the Board and each of the Directors.

All Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary, who 
is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters and 
ensuring the Board has access to the necessary policies, processes and 
resources required to operate efficiently and effectively.

Read more about our governance structure and roles 
and responsibilities on pages 68-70

Values and culture
The Board has a critical role in setting the tone of our organisation and 
championing the behaviours we expect to see throughout the Group. 
The ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ aligns with our purpose and strategy, which 
ultimately leads to a more motivated and productive workforce. 
The Board has continued to influence and monitor culture throughout 
the year and receives regular updates on the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ 
initiatives, including ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ Days, the two Spirit Beat surveys 
and the additional global pulse survey.

The cultural climate in Vodafone is measured through a number of 
mechanisms including policy and compliance processes, internal audit, 
and formal and informal channels for employees to raise concerns. 
The latter includes our bi-annual people survey and our whistleblowing 
programme, Speak Up, which is also available to the contractors and 
suppliers working with us. A series of communication materials were 
shared in April through ‘Workplace’, our internal digital platform, and

Governance

The Board ensures the highest standard of corporate governance 

is maintained by regularly reviewing developments in governance 

best practice and ensuring these are adopted by the Company.

The Board dedicated time during the year to thoroughly consider the 

independence and time commitment of all Directors, the arrangements 

in place to monitor conflicts of interest, as well as evaluating the 

effectiveness of the Board and each of the Directors.

All Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary, who 

is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters and 

ensuring the Board has access to the necessary policies, processes and 

resources required to operate efficiently and effectively.

Values and culture

The Board has a critical role in setting the tone of our organisation and 

championing the behaviours we expect to see throughout the Group. 

The ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ aligns with our purpose and strategy, which 

ultimately leads to a more motivated and productive workforce. 

The Board has continued to influence and monitor culture throughout 

the year and receives regular updates on the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ 

initiatives, including ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ Days, the two Spirit Beat surveys 

and the additional global pulse survey.

The cultural climate in Vodafone is measured through a number of 

mechanisms including policy and compliance processes, internal audit, 

and formal and informal channels for employees to raise concerns. 

The latter includes our bi-annual people survey and our whistleblowing 

programme, Speak Up, which is also available to the contractors and 

suppliers working with us. A series of communication materials were 

shared in April through ‘Workplace’, our internal digital platform, and 

other channels to address common misconceptions and encourage 

more employees to come forward with experiences and/or observations 

of those breaching the code of conduct. The Board is apprised of any 

material whistleblowing incidents.

Board activities and principal decisions
Our Board is responsible for the overall leadership of 
the Group and throughout the year, Board activities and 
discussion have continued to focus on the Company’s 
strategic priorities. The Board oversees the Company’s 
strategic direction and supports the executive 
management with its delivery of the strategy within a 
transparent governance framework. Alongside the 
strategic priorities, the Board has considered topics 
including executive succession, the business plan, 
financial performance, digital and technology, and 
governance. Further detail on these topics is set 
out below.

Digital and IT strategy
The Board was kept updated on the progress of One Technology 
following its formation 18 months ago. As at September 2022, Vodafone 
led in 13 out of 15 categories of Gartner’s IT functionality index and a key 
aim of the project was to move away from big IT transformation projects 
and focus on investing in engineering, insourcing and modernisation. 
The Chief Information Officers and Chief Technology Officers in each 
local market were made members of their company’s executive team 
and many were given additional domain roles across the Group.

Business plan and financial performance
Business plan
In the year, the Board discussed and approved the business plan.

Financial performance
The Board received regular updates on the financial performance of the 
Group. This year the Board reviewed the Group trading performance and 
financial forecast against the backdrop of rising energy prices, increased 
wage costs due to inflation, and the effect of the war in Ukraine. 
The Board also considered the Group’s debt position and agreed to 
reduce its debt in the long term. In March 2023, the Board received and 
approved the budget and long range plan.

Dividend
The decision to approve the dividend was supported by a robust 
assessment of the position, performance and viability of the business 
carried out by management. The Board was mindful that the Directors 
had continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and accounts and was also cognisant of available reserves to 
support the payment of the dividend.

On 15 November 2022, we announced an interim dividend of 4.50 
eurocents per share which was paid on 3 February 2023. We have 
recommended a final dividend of 4.50 eurocents per share to be paid 
on 4 August 2023. This was consistent with dividends declared during 
FY22 and the expectations of our shareholders.

Investor relations
The Board received regular updates on market share information and 
was kept updated on the results of an investor perception study. 
Annual roadshow feedback was also provided during the year.

Read more about how the Board engaged with investors  
during the year on page 12

Strategy and business developments
Strategy remained a key focus throughout the year. In addition to the 
usual meetings, the Board attended a strategy offsite session in South 
Africa. The deep-dive session focused on reviewing the Company’s 
portfolio and agreeing key priorities for the Company.

UK
On 3 October 2022, we confirmed that discussions were taking place 
with CK Hutchinson Holdings in relation to a possible combination of 
Vodafone UK and Three UK. The potential transaction is expected to bring 
benefits to customers through competitively priced access to a reliable, 
high-quality and secure 5G network throughout the UK.

Vodafone Hungary
This year the Board discussed the proposed sale of Vodafone Hungary 
and on 31 January 2023, we announced that Vodafone Group Plc had 
completed the sale of Vodafone Hungary to 4iG Public Limited Company 
and Corvinus Zrt. Proceeds from the sale were used for deleveraging.

Vodafone Egypt
The Board considered the growth plans for the Group and on 13 
December 2022 we announced that Vodafone Group Plc had completed 
the transfer of its 55% shareholding in Vodafone Egypt to Vodacom (its 
African subsidiary). This transfer simplifies the management of Vodafone’s 
African assets, along with the Group’s structure, and supports Vodacom 
and Vodafone Egypt for future growth.

Key stakeholders are considered in the decision-
making process in accordance with section 172 
of the Companies Act 2006.

Board has engaged with them during the year on pages 10-12

Customers
Information in relation to the evolving needs of customers is regularly 
provided to the Board by the Executive Committee members and 
senior managers.

Cost of living crisis
The Board discussed pricing trends in Europe and considered the 
Company’s cost of living initiative. The initiative consisted of three elements: 
social or low cost tariffs in all markets; extra measures to ensure consumers 
and small businesses were supported; and leveraging technology and 
digital services to help customers reduce their energy usage.

Customer experience
In March 2023, the Board received a detailed analysis of customer satisfaction 
and experience in markets across the Group. Updates were provided on new 
tools to generate more actionable insights and the implementation of more 
impactful processes to improve customer experience. Noting the current pain 
points, the Board considered the planned actions for each market during the 
course of the next financial year.

Vodafone Germany
The Board received regular updates on customer trends in Germany 
throughout the year. The Board considered the performance of the 
network, the impact of shop closures, changes in regulation and the 
difficulties experienced with the rollout of a new IT system. Focus was 
also given to improving customer service.

Digital and technology
New technology operating model
The Board received an update following the transition to a new technology 
operating model. The technology organisation changed from one per 
country to a common European organisation based on scaled domains and 
sub domains. The main aim of the model was to enable faster decision-
making. Not only have significant cost savings been achieved, but 
operational performance has improved following the implementation. 
The employee Technology Spirit survey results had also improved during 
the transition following improvements to career development and the 
reputation of Vodafone as an employer of technologists.

The Board considered the positive impact, along with improvements to 
innovation and customer experience.

to sell a stake in Vantage Towers in order to optimise capital and structure 
and generate upfront cash proceeds to support the Group’s deleveraging 
strategic priority. In November 2022, we announced that the Board had 
taken the decision to enter a co-control partnership with Global 
Infrastructure Partners and KKR for Vantage Towers. The partnership is 
with long-term investors with significant expertise in digital infrastructure 
and is expected to accelerate Vantage Tower’s growth and value creation, 
whilst retaining co-control over a strategically important asset.

Key steps to date

with the support of an external legal adviser, conducted a deep-dive 
analysis to consider stakeholder interests and whether the Vantage 
Towers transaction (and which of the proposed counterparts) was 
in the best interests of the Company’s members as a whole.

The following factors were taken into consideration by the Board in its 
analysis and decision-making:

 – the respective valuations;
 – the terms proposed by each bid;
 – agreement changes;
 – funding and structure;
 – protection for risks in relation to minority shareholders;
 – regulatory, legal and governance considerations; and

Board effectiveness and improving our performance
The Board recognises that it needs to continually 
monitor and improve its performance. Our annual 
performance evaluation provides the opportunity 
for the Board and its Committees to consider and 
reflect on the effectiveness of its activities, the 
quality of its decision-making, and the collective 
contribution made by each Board member.

Progress against actions identified following the 2022 external 
evaluation
Action

The composition, performance and effectiveness of each of the Board 
Committees was also evaluated and the Committee members agreed 
that each Committee was functioning effectively.

Progress made

Refresh the composition of the 
Board to bring on more Directors 
with technology and/or 
telecommunications sector 
experience. 

Four new Non-Executive 
Directors have been appointed 
to the Board in FY23, each 
bringing extensive technology 
and telecommunications 
experience. 

Devote more time to strategy 
sessions to enhance free-flowing 
discussions and allow for 
additional topics to be discussed 
where required. 

Topics requiring additional 
deep-dives could be bolstered by 
using smaller groups of the Board 
with specific expertise in the 
matter.

The Board held several strategic 
deep-dive sessions during the 
year to enhance discussions.

A Board sub-committee has 
been set up to consider merger 
and acquisition transactions. 

Process undertaken for our Board evaluation
In accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommendations and following two consecutive years of externally 
facilitated Board evaluations, the 2023 Board evaluation was 
conducted internally.

Evaluation process
The internal evaluation was led by the Chair and supported by the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary. The structure of the evaluation 
was agreed and the objectives of the review were to provide an 
assessment of Vodafone Group’s Board effectiveness and governance, 
including the effectiveness of its Committees.

A tailored Board questionnaire was compiled to gather and distil feedback 
on topics including composition, diversity and how effectively members 
worked together to achieve objectives. The Directors’ responses were 
collated and a paper summarising the findings was presented to the 
Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board at the March 
2023 meetings.

Evaluation findings
The Board discussed the findings from the evaluation and was 
encouraged by the strengths identified. In particular, the Board 
agreed that:

 – there has been effective leadership throughout the year and the Chair 

continued to actively encourage input from all Board members, 
facilitating open discussion and constructive challenge;

 – the conduct of the meetings and the materials provided supported the 
Board in discharging its responsibilities and ensuring that meetings ran 
effectively and efficiently; and

 – following the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors, good 

progress has been made in increasing sector experience and skills on 
the Board, which in turn has supported strategic discussion and 
decision-making.

The Board also identified areas in which it could improve. Particular areas 
of focus for the coming year include:

 – Leadership: succession planning, including securing and on-boarding 

an outstanding Chief Financial Officer;

 – Operational Performance: prioritising time spent on the key strategic 

pillars of customer satisfaction, simplification and growth; and 

 – Technology: increasing the Board’s focus on technology strategy and 

capital allocation.

Director and a summary of the skills and experience of the 
Non-Executive Directors on pages 60 and 65-67

Appointment process for Non-Executive Directors
To begin the appointment process, the Company engages with an 
external search consultancy which it provides with a search specification. 
The consultancy then proposes a list of individuals with a diverse range 
of backgrounds and characteristics. Capturing the clear benefits of 
diversity of background and opinion, and identifying candidates with the 
requisite experience and capabilities, is at the forefront of this search. 
The shortlisted candidates are interviewed by the Committee members 
and they meet with the Group Chief Executive. A recommendation is 
made to the Board on the chosen candidate. Once a candidate is selected, 
appointment terms are drafted and agreed with the selected candidate.

Executive Committee changes, succession planning and talent 
pipeline
The Committee receives regular updates on succession planning and 
changes to the membership of the Executive Committee. This year, 
the Committee has discussed succession plans for executives below 
Board level.

Following Nick Read stepping down from his role as Group Chief 
Executive in December 2022, Margherita Della Valle was appointed as 
Group Chief Executive on an interim basis with effect from 1 January 
2023, whilst continuing her role as Group Chief Financial Officer. We are 
grateful to Nick Read for his significant commitment and contribution to 
Vodafone during his career. The Board announced on 27 April 2023, 
following a rigorous internal and external search, that Margherita was 
appointed as the permanent Group Chief Executive. She will also continue 
as Group Chief Financial Officer until an external search for a new Group 
Chief Financial Officer is complete.

During the year the Committee discussed succession planning for a 
new Group Chief Technology Officer and Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary following the respective retirements of Johan 
Wibergh on 31 December 2022 and Rosemary Martin on 1 March 2023. 
Both individuals also stepped down from the Executive Committee on 
their respective retirement dates. 

Following the recruitment process, we were pleased to announce the 
appointment of Maaike de Bie as Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary with effect from 1 March 2023. Maaike also joined the 
Executive Committee with effect from the same date. With almost 30 
years of experience, Maaike is an experienced international lawyer and 
is dual qualified in both the US and UK. She has held numerous senior 
roles in a variety of sectors, including at EY LLP, General Electric and the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development LLP. Maaike has 
also previously served as General Counsel and Company Secretary 
of easyJet plc and Royal Mail plc.

Following the announcement on 10 May 2023, Sir Crispin Davis and 
Valerie Gooding will be stepping down as members of the Committee 
with effect from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. David Nish will join 
the Committee with effect from the same date.

The Committee is comprised solely of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Committee had four scheduled meetings during the year 
and additional ad hoc meetings as required. The attendance at Committee 
meetings can be found on page 60.

Letter from Committee Chair
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Nominations and 
Governance Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2023.

Board composition and succession planning
The main areas of focus for the Committee this year have been Board 
and Executive Committee composition and succession planning, with 
a continued focus on the appointment of Non-Executive Directors with 
telecommunications, technology, and e-commerce expertise, as well as 
the process to identify a permanent Group Chief Executive.

The Committee monitors the length of tenure and the skills of the 
Non-Executive Directors to assist with succession planning. We reported 
last year that there were several upcoming scheduled retirements from 
the Board and on 10 May 2023 we announced that Sir Crispin Davis, 
Dame Clara Furse and Valerie Gooding would not be seeking re-election 
at the 2023 AGM.

In anticipation of these scheduled departures, the Committee focused 
on finding suitable Non-Executive Director successors to further enhance 
the Board’s experience and capabilities in the telecommunications and 
technology sectors. MWM Consulting, an independent external search firm, 
was appointed to support this process. Following shareholder approval at 
the Annual General Meeting on 26 July 2022, Stephen Carter, Delphine 
Ernotte Cunci and Simon Segars were appointed as Non-Executive 
Directors, each bringing a broad range of experience and expertise to the 
Board. In November 2022, we also announced the appointment of Christine 
Ramon who joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 14 November 
2022. Christine brings extensive financial and strategic experience, along 
with telecommunications expertise. She also has comprehensive African 
market experience that will support the strategic aims of the Group and 
I am delighted to welcome her to Vodafone’s Board.

In light of these Board changes and having reviewed the composition 
of the Board Committees, we announced that with effect from 8 
November 2022, Stephen Carter became a member of the Nominations 
and Governance Committee, Delphine Ernotte Cunci a member of 
the Remuneration Committee and Simon Segars a member of the ESG 
Committee. Christine Ramon was appointed a member of the Audit 
and Risk Committee with effect from 28 March 2023.

Governance
The Committee continues to review action taken to comply with 
the Code and other legal and regulatory obligations during the year. 
The Committee receives regular governance updates and is satisfied that 
Vodafone has complied with the Code in full during the year.

Independence
In accordance with the Code, the independence of all the Non-Executive 
Directors was considered by the Committee. At the date of publication, 
Valerie Gooding has served more than nine years as a director; however, 
she will remain on the Board until the conclusion of the 2023 AGM in 
order to allow for a gradual and smooth transition period of the Senior 
Independent Director, Workforce Engagement Leads and Remuneration 
Committee Chair roles. Following evaluation, all Non-Executive Directors 
are considered independent, and they continue to make independent 
contributions and effectively challenge management.

All Non-Executive Directors have submitted themselves for election or 
re-election, as applicable, at the 2023 AGM, other than Sir Crispin Davis, 
Dame Clara Furse and Valerie Gooding who will retire from the Board at 
the conclusion of the 2023 AGM as announced on 10 May 2023.

The Executive Directors’ service contracts and Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointment letters are available for inspection at our registered office 
and at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.

Conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 provides that directors have a duty to avoid a 
situation in which they have or may have a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts or might conflict with the interests of the Company. This duty is 
in addition to the existing duty owed to the Company to disclose to the 
Board any interest in a transaction or arrangement under consideration 
by the Company.

Our Directors must report any changes to their commitments to the 
Board, immediately notify the Company of actual or potential conflicts 
or a change in circumstances relating to an existing authorisation and 
complete an annual conflicts questionnaire. Any conflicts or potential 
conflicts identified are considered and, where appropriate, authorised 
by the Board in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
A register of authorised conflicts is also reviewed periodically.

The Committee and the Board are satisfied that the external 
commitments of the Directors do not conflict with their duties and 
commitments as Directors of the Company. The Committee is 
comfortable that it has adequate measures in place to manage and 
mitigate any actual or potential conflicts of interests that may arise 
in the future.

Time commitment
In accordance with the Code, the Committee actively reviews the time 
commitments of the Board. All Directors are engaged in providing their 
external commitments to establish that they have sufficient time to meet 
their Board responsibilities. The Committee is satisfied that the Board does 
meet this requirement and all Directors provide constructive challenge, 
strategic guidance and hold management to account.

Board evaluation
In accordance with the Code, Vodafone conducts an annual evaluation of 
Board and Board Committee performance, which every Director engages 
in, and which is facilitated by an independent third party at least once 
every three years. This year, an internal evaluation of the performance 
of the Board and Committees took place led by the Chair, with support 
from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary.

set out the role and responsibilities of the Committee in further detail

Diversity
The Board Diversity Policy reinforces the ongoing commitment of the 
Board to supporting diversity and inclusion in the boardroom in all its 
forms including age, gender ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and 
socio-economic background. The Committee acknowledges the 
significant role diversity and inclusion has on the effective functioning 
of the Board and its Committees and believes a diverse board brings 
a broader perspective, which enables it to be better equipped to 
understand the views of our stakeholders as well as our shareholders 
in the decision-making process. 

The Committee reviews the Board Diversity Policy annually to ensure 
the objectives remain appropriate and sufficiently stretching. We also 
continue to monitor requirements as set by the Financial Conduct 
Authority, FTSE Women Leaders Review, NASDAQ listing rules and the 
Parker Review in terms of gender and ethnic diversity. Vodafone 
acknowledges that these targets are not just an end goal, but rather steps 
towards a drive for further progress.

Whilst the Board Diversity Policy specifically focuses on diversity at Board 
and Committee level, commitment to diversity at Vodafone extends 
beyond the Board to the Executive Committee, talent pipeline and global 
workforce. The Board supports management in their efforts to build a 
diverse organisation throughout the Group. As at 31 March 2023, our 
Executive Committee has four positions held by women (33%) and 25% 
of the Executive Committee identifies as ethnically diverse. In the Senior 
Leadership Team, 49 roles are held by women (33%) and 18% of the 
Senior Leadership Team identify as ethnically diverse.

Stephen A. Carter CBE (appointed as a member on 8 November 2022)

Following the announcement on 10 May 2023, Sir Crispin Davis and 

Valerie Gooding will be stepping down as members of the Committee 

with effect from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. David Nish will join 

the Committee with effect from the same date.

The Committee is comprised solely of independent Non-Executive 

Directors. The Committee had four scheduled meetings during the year 

and additional ad hoc meetings as required. The attendance at Committee 

meetings can be found on page 60.

Letter from Committee Chair

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Nominations and 

Governance Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2023.

Board composition and succession planning

The main areas of focus for the Committee this year have been Board 

and Executive Committee composition and succession planning, with 

a continued focus on the appointment of Non-Executive Directors with 

telecommunications, technology, and e-commerce expertise, as well as 

the process to identify a permanent Group Chief Executive.

The Committee monitors the length of tenure and the skills of the 

Non-Executive Directors to assist with succession planning. We reported 

last year that there were several upcoming scheduled retirements from 

the Board and on 10 May 2023 we announced that Sir Crispin Davis, 

Dame Clara Furse and Valerie Gooding would not be seeking re-election 

at the 2023 AGM.

In anticipation of these scheduled departures, the Committee focused 

on finding suitable Non-Executive Director successors to further enhance 

the Board’s experience and capabilities in the telecommunications and 

technology sectors. MWM Consulting, an independent external search firm, 

was appointed to support this process. Following shareholder approval at 

the Annual General Meeting on 26 July 2022, Stephen Carter, Delphine 

Ernotte Cunci and Simon Segars were appointed as Non-Executive 

Directors, each bringing a broad range of experience and expertise to the 

Board. In November 2022, we also announced the appointment of Christine 

Ramon who joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 14 November 

2022. Christine brings extensive financial and strategic experience, along 

with telecommunications expertise. She also has comprehensive African 

market experience that will support the strategic aims of the Group and 

I am delighted to welcome her to Vodafone’s Board.

In light of these Board changes and having reviewed the composition 

of the Board Committees, we announced that with effect from 8 

November 2022, Stephen Carter became a member of the Nominations 

and Governance Committee, Delphine Ernotte Cunci a member of 

the Remuneration Committee and Simon Segars a member of the ESG 

Committee. Christine Ramon was appointed a member of the Audit 

and Risk Committee with effect from 28 March 2023.

Non-Executive Directors explain their role:

The Committee has also considered the succession plans for the roles 

of Senior Independent Director, Workforce Engagement Lead and Chair 

of the Remuneration Committee in line with the expected retirement of 

Valerie Gooding this year, following nine years’ service to the Board. With 

effect from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, David Nish will be appointed 

as Senior Independent Director, Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Christine 

Ramon will be appointed Workforce Engagement Leads, and Amparo 

Moraleda will be appointed Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 

The Committee is confident that the Board currently has the 

necessary mix of skills and experience to contribute to the Company’s 

strategic objectives.

Director and a summary of the skills and experience of the 

Non-Executive Directors on pages 60 and 65-67

Appointment process for Non-Executive Directors

To begin the appointment process, the Company engages with an 

external search consultancy which it provides with a search specification. 

The consultancy then proposes a list of individuals with a diverse range 

of backgrounds and characteristics. Capturing the clear benefits of 

diversity of background and opinion, and identifying candidates with the 

requisite experience and capabilities, is at the forefront of this search. 

The shortlisted candidates are interviewed by the Committee members 

and they meet with the Group Chief Executive. A recommendation is 

made to the Board on the chosen candidate. Once a candidate is selected, 

appointment terms are drafted and agreed with the selected candidate.

Executive Committee changes, succession planning and talent 

pipeline

Board level.

The Committee receives regular updates on succession planning and 

changes to the membership of the Executive Committee. This year, 

the Committee has discussed succession plans for executives below 

Following Nick Read stepping down from his role as Group Chief 

Executive in December 2022, Margherita Della Valle was appointed as 

Group Chief Executive on an interim basis with effect from 1 January 

2023, whilst continuing her role as Group Chief Financial Officer. We are 

grateful to Nick Read for his significant commitment and contribution to 

Vodafone during his career. The Board announced on 27 April 2023, 

following a rigorous internal and external search, that Margherita was 

appointed as the permanent Group Chief Executive. She will also continue 

as Group Chief Financial Officer until an external search for a new Group 

Chief Financial Officer is complete.

During the year the Committee discussed succession planning for a 

new Group Chief Technology Officer and Group General Counsel and 

Company Secretary following the respective retirements of Johan 

Wibergh on 31 December 2022 and Rosemary Martin on 1 March 2023. 

Both individuals also stepped down from the Executive Committee on 

their respective retirement dates. 

Following the recruitment process, we were pleased to announce the 

appointment of Maaike de Bie as Group General Counsel and Company 

Secretary with effect from 1 March 2023. Maaike also joined the 

Executive Committee with effect from the same date. With almost 30 

years of experience, Maaike is an experienced international lawyer and 

is dual qualified in both the US and UK. She has held numerous senior 

roles in a variety of sectors, including at EY LLP, General Electric and the 

European Bank for Reconstruction and Development LLP. Maaike has 

also previously served as General Counsel and Company Secretary 

of easyJet plc and Royal Mail plc.

Letter from the Committee Chair
I am pleased to present our report as Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee. This report provides an overview of how the Committee 
operates, an insight into the Committee’s activities during the year 
and its role in ensuring the integrity of the Group’s published financial 
information and the effectiveness of its risk management, controls 
and related processes.

The Committee met five times during the year, which included a joint 
meeting with the ESG Committee. Amparo Moraleda will step-down 
from the Committee with effect from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. 
The attendance by members at Committee meetings can be seen on 
page 60. Each meeting agenda included a range of topics across the 
Committee’s areas of responsibility.

 – External cyber threats continue to be a Group principal risk and the 

Group invests considerable resources in the technology teams working 
to prevent, identify and manage attempted cyber attacks. During the 
year, the Committee regularly met with the Chief Technology Officer 
and Cyber Security, Technology Assurance and Strategy Director to 
review and challenge the cyber security strategy and also undertook 
a deep dive review of this principal risk.

Read more about cyber security  
on pages 42 to 43

 – We performed deep dive reviews on several other principal risks, including 

technology resilience and future readiness with the Chief Technology Officer 
and Chief Network Officer, as well as threats from emerging technology 
and disruptive business models with the CEO of Vodafone Business and the 
Group Strategy Director. In addition, the Committee undertook a number 
of reviews of M-Pesa with a focus on risk management, the control 
environment, regulatory compliance and assurance activities;

 – We completed a series of reviews across multiple business units, typically 
with a focus on the risk and control environment. This was performed 
with the CEO and CFO of the Other Europe markets cluster, the CEO of 
Vantage Towers, the CEOs of Vodafone Germany, Vodafone Spain and 
Vodacom Group; and

 – At the September 2022 and March 2023 meetings, we considered 
the anticipated financial reporting matters impacting the half-year 
and year-end reporting. We also reviewed the half-year results 
announcement at our November meeting and the Annual Report and 
accompanying materials at our May meeting, prior to the Group’s results 
release. Our work included reviews of goodwill impairment testing, 
taxation judgements, legal contingencies and the Company’s work 
on going concern and the long-term viability statement.

The Committee recognises the importance of Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’) topics and the requirement for disclosures in 
accordance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(‘TCFD’) framework. We modified our terms of reference during the year 
to enhance the Committee’s oversight in these areas by having a joint 
meeting with the ESG Committee. During our joint meeting in May 2023, 
we challenged the disclosures included in this Annual Report and also 
the Group’s ESG Addendum which is available on our website.

Our external auditor, Ernst & Young (‘EY’), provides robust challenge to 
management and its independent view to the Committee on specific 
financial reporting judgements and the control environment.

Objective
The objective of the Committee is the provision of effective governance 
over the appropriateness of financial reporting of the Group, including 
the adequacy of related disclosures, the performance of both the

systems of internal control, business risks and related compliance activities.

a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy. This 
assessment is supported by the Group’s Disclosure Committee which 
is chaired by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary who 
briefs the Committee on the Disclosure Committee’s work and findings.

The Committee reviewed the processes and controls that underpin 
the Annual Report’s preparation, ensuring that all contributors and 
senior management are fully aware of the requirements and their 
responsibilities. This included the financial reporting responsibilities of 
the Directors under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to promote 
the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as well as 
considering the interests of other stakeholders which will have an impact 
on the Company’s long-term success.

The Committee reviewed an early draft of the Annual Report to 
enable input and comment. The review is performed in conjunction 
with the ESG Committee which also reviews the TCFD and ESG-related 
disclosures. The Committee also reviewed the results announcement, 
supported by the work of the Group’s Disclosure Committee, which 
reviews and assesses the appropriateness of investor communications.

This work enabled the Committee to provide positive assurance to the 
Board to assist it in making the statement required by the Code.

Significant financial reporting judgements
The areas considered and actions taken by the Committee in relation 
to the 2023 consolidated financial statements are outlined below and 
overleaf. For each area, the Committee was satisfied with the accounting 
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. 

Area of focus

Actions taken

Portfolio changes 
The Group concluded several transactions during the second half of the 
financial year of which the most notable was the disposal of a controlling 
stake in Vantage Towers into a joint venture, the disposals of Vodafone 
Hungary and Vodafone Ghana and the transfer of the Group’s 
shareholding in Vodafone Egypt to its subsidiary, Vodacom Group 
Limited. The most significant disclosure and accounting judgements 
considered include:

 – The recognition and measurement of gains on the business disposals, 
including a partial deferral of the gain recognised from the sale of 
Vantage Towers due to the leaseback of tower space by the Group 
from Vantage Towers. See note 12 ‘Investments in associates and 
joint arrangements’ and note 27 ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ in the 
consolidated financial statements.

India accounting matters
The disclosure and accounting judgements in relation to:

 – The Group’s conditional and capped obligations to make certain 
payments to Vodafone Idea Limited (‘VIL’) under a payment 
mechanism agreed at the time of the merger between Vodafone India 
and Idea Cellular in 2017;

 – The valuation of the security package provided by the Group to Indus 
Towers (‘Indus’) in respect of commitments of VIL to Indus and the 
Group’s obligation to the Total Return Swap (‘TRS’) lenders;

 – The valuation of a mark-to-market derivative asset in relation to the TRS;
 – The decision to cease reporting the Group’s investment in Indus as 

held for sale in the consolidated financial statements; and

 – The impairment of the Group’s investment in Indus.

See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ and note 
29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ in the consolidated 
financial statements. 

Impairments
Judgements in relation to impairment testing relate primarily to the 
assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use of the Group’s 
businesses, being the achievability of the long-term business plans and 
the macroeconomic and related valuation model assumptions.

See note 4 ‘Impairment losses’ in the consolidated financial statements. 

The Committee met with the Group Financial Controlling and Operations 
Director in March 2023 to review and challenge the accounting 
treatment and disclosures in the 2023 consolidated financial statements, 
including the sale and leaseback accounting resulting from the disposal 
of Vantage Towers.

The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting 
judgements in relation to potential liabilities under the payment 
mechanism agreed with VIL, considering VIL’s ability to make any further 
material payments.

The Committee also reviewed accounting judgements relating to Indus 
Towers, notably the terms of the remaining pledge contained in the 
security package, the reversal of the held for sale classification in the 
consolidated financial statements and the valuation of the TRS related 
derivative asset. 

These reviews occurred at the September 2022, November 2022, March 
2023 and May 2023 Committee meetings. 

The Committee met with the Group Head of Financial Planning & 
Analysis in November 2022 and May 2023 to discuss the impairment 
exercise undertaken and to challenge the appropriateness of 
assumptions made, including:

 – The consistent application of management’s valuation methodology;
 – The achievability of the Group’s five-year business plans;
 – The potential impacts of (i) rising energy costs, (ii) inflation and (iii) 

climate change on the Group’s businesses and valuation assumptions;
 – The long-term growth assumed for the Group’s businesses at the end 

of the plan period; and

 – The discount rates assumed in the valuation of the Group’s businesses.

During the year, the Group recorded no material impairments of asset 
carrying values.

Actions taken

Liability provisioning
The Group is subject to a range of claims and legal actions from a 
number of sources, including, but not limited to, competitors, regulators, 
customers, suppliers and, on occasion, fellow shareholders in 
Group subsidiaries.

See note 16 ‘Provisions’ and note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal 
proceedings’ in the consolidated financial statements. 

Taxation
The Group is subject to a range of tax claims and related legal actions  
in several jurisdictions where it operates. Furthermore, the Group has 
extensive accumulated tax losses, and a key management judgement  
is whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised in respect 
of those losses.

See note 6 ’Taxation’ and note 29 ’Contingent liabilities and legal 
proceedings’ in the consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue recognition
Revenue is a risk area given the inherent complexity of IFRS 15 
accounting requirements and the underlying billing and related 
IT systems.

See note 1 ’Basis of preparation’ in the consolidated financial statements. 

Hyperinflation accounting in Turkey
Turkey has met the requirements to be designated as a hyperinflationary 
economy under IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary 
Economies’. The Group has therefore applied the requirements of IAS 29 
for its Turkish operations with a Turkish lira functional currency.

See note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ in the consolidated financial statements.

Regulators and our financial reporting
The Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) publishes thematic reviews and 
other guidance to help companies improve the quality of corporate 
reporting through the provision of guidance and reviews of the quality 
of reporting across public companies. The Group routinely reviews FRC 
publications, the most relevant publications for the 2023 Annual 
Report being:

 – Key matters for 2022/23 reports and accounts;
 – Annual review of corporate reporting 2021/22;
 – Thematic review of existing disclosure requirements for (i) discount 

rates, (ii) judgements and estimates, (iii) earnings per share, (iv) deferred 
tax assets, (v) accounting and reporting for business combinations and 
(vi) TCFD and climate-related disclosures;

 – ‘What makes a good Annual Report and Accounts’ guidance;
 – Updated guidance on Strategic Reports; and
 – FRC Lab report on digital security risk disclosure.

The Group already complied with the majority of the recommendations 
and the 2023 Annual Report has been updated to adopt best practice 
where appropriate.

We also reviewed the draft standard for Audit Committees that was 
published by the FRC in the year. The final requirements will be reviewed 
once available although no significant impact is expected as we have 
assessed that the Committee follows the working practices outlined 
in the draft standard.

The Committee met with the Director of Litigation in November 2022 
and May 2023 in advance of the half-year and year-end reporting, 
respectively. The Committee reviewed and challenged management’s 
assessment of the status of the most significant claims, together with 
relevant legal advice received by the Group, to form a view on the level 
of provisioning and appropriateness of disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements. 

The Committee met with the Group Tax Director in November 2022  
and May 2023 in advance of the half-year and year-end financial

underpinning tax provisioning, deferred tax assets and related 
disclosures. 

The accounting policy for and related disclosure requirements of IFRS 15 
that have been presented in the Annual Report were reviewed in March 
and May 2023.

The Committee considered the scope of EY’s planned revenue audit 
procedures, and their related audit findings and observations at its 
meetings in November 2022 and May 2023. 

The Committee met with the Group Financial Controlling and Operations 
Director in November 2022, March 2023 and May 2023 to review and

During the year, the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) finalised 
new mandatory disclosure requirements on diversity and inclusion. 
The Committee welcomes these new disclosure requirements which 
are included in this Annual Report. 

We continue to track developments for the proposals in the ‘Restoring 
Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance’ paper issued by the Department 
for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (‘BEIS’). This will ensure we are 
well placed to implement the changes, as required, in the years ahead.

During the year, the Group received a notification letter from the FRC that 
the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2022 had been included 
in their thematic review of company disclosures relating to deferred tax 
assets. In October 2022, we received confirmation that the FRC had no 
questions for the Group arising from the review.

In December 2021, Vantage Towers A.G. (‘Vantage Towers’) received 
an enquiry letter from BaFin, the German Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority, containing questions and requests for further information 
in relation to the Vantage Towers Annual Report for the year ended 
31 March 2022. To date, two written responses in January and March 
2023 have been submitted to BaFin as part of the ongoing enquiry.

Internal control and risk management
The Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of the 
Group’s system of internal control, including the risk management 
framework, the compliance framework, and the work of the Internal 
Audit function.

Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function provides independent and objective 
assurance over the design and operating effectiveness of the system of 
internal control, through a risk-based approach. The function reports into 
the Committee and, administratively, to the Chief Financial Officer. The 
function is composed of teams across Group functions and local markets. 
This enables access to specialist skills through centres of excellence and 
ensures local knowledge and experience. Cooperation with professional 
bodies and an information technology research firm has ensured access 
to additional specialist skills and an advanced knowledge base.

Internal Audit activities are based on a robust methodology and the 
internal quality assurance improvement programme ensures conformity 
with the International Professional Practices framework, which includes 
the IIA standards and code of ethics, and the continuous development 
of the audit methodology applied. The conformity is reviewed and verified 
through an external quality assessment by an independent consultancy 
firm every three years.

The Committee has a standing agenda item to cover Internal Audit 
related topics. Prior to the start of each financial year, the Committee 
reviews and approves the annual audit plan, assesses the adequacy of 
the budget and resources, and reviews the operational initiatives for the 
continuous improvement of the function’s effectiveness. The audit plan 
is determined by taking into account Internal Audit’s rolling review 
framework and the outputs of a data-driven risk assessment. 

The Committee reviews progress against the approved audit plan and the 
results of Internal Audit activities, with a stronger focus on unsatisfactory 
audit results and cross-entity audits, which are audits that are performed 
across multiple markets with the same scope. Audit results are analysed 
by process and entity to highlight both changes in the control 
environment and areas that require attention.

During the year, Internal Audit coverage focused on principal risks, 
including cyber threat and strategic transformation. Relevant audit results 
are reported before the Committee’s in-depth review with the risk owner, 
which allows the Committee to have an integrated view on the way 
the risk is managed.

Assurance was also provided across a broad range of areas, including: 
product development, customer base management, Vodafone Business 
sales opportunity governance, billing of Internet of Things services, 
compliance with the EU Electronic Communications Code, data 
management, data protection at third parties, asset verification and 
reconciliation, revenue and cost assurance controls, revenue accrual 
processes, lease accounting, active directory infrastructure security, 
Application Programming Interface security and M-Pesa operations. 
The activities performed by the shared service organisation also received 
ongoing focus due to their significance across many processes.

Management is responsible for ensuring that issues raised by Internal 
Audit are addressed within an agreed timetable, and the Committee 
reviews their timely completion.

The last independent review of the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal 
Audit function was performed by Deloitte LLP in January 2022 and the 
results have been presented to the Committee. The review concluded 
that the Internal Audit function operated in accordance with the Global 
Institute of Internal Auditors’ International Professional Practices 
Framework, is at the top of its peer group range and demonstrates areas 
of innovative practice.

The Internal Audit function continues to invest in several initiatives to 
improve its effectiveness, particularly in the adoption of new technologies. 
The innovative use of data analytics has provided broader and deeper 
audit testing and driven increased insights.

Assessment of the Group’s system of internal control, 
including the risk management framework
The Group’s risk assessment process and the way in which significant 
business risks are managed is an area of focus for the Committee. 
The Committee’s activity here was led primarily, but not solely, by the 
Group’s assessment of its principal and emerging risks and uncertainties. 
Cyber threats remain a major focus for the Committee given the 
continual threats in this area.

The Group has an internal control environment designed to protect the 
business from the material risks which have been identified. Management 
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls 
and the Committee has responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness 
of those controls.

The Committee reviewed the process by which Group management 
assessed the control environment, in accordance with the requirements 
of the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting published by the FRC. This activity 
was supported by reports from the Group Audit Director and the Group 
Head of Risk and a range of functional specialists.

As part of the Committee’s recurring agenda items, the Group Security 
Director provided a fraud update, the scope of which would include 
incidents of fraud involving management or employees with a significant 
role in internal controls.

The Group operates a ‘Speak Up’ channel that enables employees to 
anonymously raise concerns about possible irregularities. The Committee 
received an update on the operation of the channel together with the 
output of any resulting investigations.

The Committee has completed its review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control, including risk management, during 
the year and up to the date of this Annual Report. The review covered 
all material controls including financial, operating and compliance 
controls. The Committee confirms that the system of internal control 
operated effectively for the 2023 financial year. Where specific areas 
for improvement were identified, mitigating alternative controls and 
processes were in place. This allows us to provide positive assurance 
to the Board to help fulfil its obligations under the Code.

Compliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Oversight of the Group’s compliance activities in relation to section 404 
of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and policy compliance reviews also fall 
within the Committee’s remit.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal controls over financial reporting and we have responsibility for 
ensuring the effectiveness of these controls. The Committee received 
updates on the Group’s work in relation to section 404 compliance and 
the Group’s broader financial control environment during the year. We 
continue to challenge management on ensuring the nature and scope 
of control activities evolve to ensure key risks continue to be adequately 
mitigated. For example, robust controls over our IT systems are critical 
and were discussed with the Chief Technology Officer and IT Director 
at the November 2022 meeting.

The Committee also took an active role in monitoring the Group’s 
compliance activities, including receiving reports from management in 
the year covering programme-level strategy, the scope of compliance 
work performed and the results of controls testing. The external auditor 
also reports the status of its work in relation to controls in its reports to 
the Committee.

Independence and objectivity
In its assessment of the independence of the auditor, and in accordance 
with the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s (‘PCAOB’) 
standard on independence, the Committee received details of all 
relationships between the Company and EY that may have a bearing 
on its independence and received confirmation from EY that it is 
independent of the Company in accordance with US federal securities 
law and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) and the PCAOB.

Effectiveness of the external audit process
The Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit process 
throughout the year and considered the performance of EY. 
This comprised the Committee’s own assessment and the results of a 
detailed feedback survey of senior personnel across the Group. Based on 
these reviews, the Committee concluded that there had been appropriate 
focus and challenge by EY on the primary areas of the audit and that 
EY had applied robust challenge and scepticism throughout the audit.

EY audit and non-audit fees
Total fees payable to EY for audit and non-audit services in the year 
ended 31 March 2023 amounted to €30 million (FY22: €25 million).

Audit fees
The Committee reviewed and discussed the fee proposal, was engaged 
in agreeing audit scope changes and, following the receipt of formal 
assurance that its fees were appropriate for the scope of the work 
required, agreed an audit fee of €27 million for statutory audit services 
in the year (FY22: €23 million).

Non-audit fees
To protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, 
the Committee has a policy for the engagement of the external auditor 
to provide non-audit services. The policy prohibits EY from playing any 
part in management or decision-making, providing certain services such 
as valuation work and the provision of accounting services. The Group’s 
non-audit services policy incorporates the requirements of the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard, including a ‘whitelist’ of permitted non-audit services 
which mirrors the FRC’s Ethical Standard.

The Committee has pre-approved that EY can be engaged by 
management, subject to the policies set out above, and subject to:

 – A €60,000 fee limit for individual engagements;
 – A €500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no legal 

alternative; and

 – A €500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no practical 

alternative supplier.

For those permitted services that exceed these specified fee limits, 
the Committee Chair pre-approves the service.

Non-audit fees were €3 million (FY22: €2 million). See note 3 ‘Operating 
profit’ in the consolidated financial statements.

Long-term viability statement and  
going concern assessment
The Committee provides advice to the Board on the form and basis of 
conclusion underlying the long-term viability statement and the going 
concern assessment.

Read more about the long-term viability statement

on page 112

At our meeting in May 2023, the Committee challenged management 
on its financial risk assessment as part of its consideration of the 
long-term viability statement. This included scrutiny of forecast liquidity, 
balance sheet stress tests, the availability of cash and cash equivalents 
through new or existing financing facilities and a review of counter-party 
risk to assess the likelihood of third parties not being able to meet 
contractual obligations. This comprehensive assessment of the Group’s 
prospects made by management included consideration of:

 – The review period and alignment with the Group’s internal 

long-term forecasts;

 – The assessment of the capacity of the Group to remain viable after 

consideration of future cash flows, expected debt service requirements, 
undrawn facilities, and access to capital markets;

 – The modelling of the financial impact of severe but plausible risk 

scenarios materialising, including the impact of energy price inflation;
 – The inclusion of clear and enhanced disclosures in the Annual Report 

as to why the assessment period selected was appropriate to 
the Group, what qualifications and assumptions were made and 
how the underlying analysis was performed, consistent with 
FRC pronouncements; and

 – Comprehensive disclosure in relation to the Group’s liquidity provided 
in the consolidated financial statements. See note 22 ‘Capital and 
financial risk management’ in the consolidated financial statements.

External audit
The Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship 
with the external auditor, EY. This includes making the recommendation 
on the appointment, reappointment, and removal of the external auditor, 
assessing its independence on an ongoing basis, and approving the 
statutory audit fee, the scope of the statutory audit and the appointment 
of the lead audit engagement partner. Alison Duncan has held this role 
for four years since the appointment of EY as external auditor for the year 
ended 31 March 2020.

EY presented to the Committee its detailed audit plan for the 2023 
financial year, which outlined its audit scope, planning materiality and its 
assessment of key audit risks. The identification of key audit risks is critical 
in the overall effectiveness of the external audit process and these are 
outlined in the Auditor’s report.

The Committee also received reports from EY on its assessment 
of the accounting and disclosures in the financial statements and 
financial controls.

The Committee will continue to review the auditor appointment and 
anticipates that the audit will be put out to tender at least every 10 years. 
The Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 
for the financial year under review. The last external audit tender took 
place in 2019 which resulted in the appointment of EY.

Effectiveness of the external audit process

The Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit process 

throughout the year and considered the performance of EY. 

This comprised the Committee’s own assessment and the results of a 

detailed feedback survey of senior personnel across the Group. Based on 

these reviews, the Committee concluded that there had been appropriate 

focus and challenge by EY on the primary areas of the audit and that 

EY had applied robust challenge and scepticism throughout the audit.

EY audit and non-audit fees

Total fees payable to EY for audit and non-audit services in the year 

ended 31 March 2023 amounted to €30 million (FY22: €25 million).

Audit fees

The Committee reviewed and discussed the fee proposal, was engaged 

in agreeing audit scope changes and, following the receipt of formal 

assurance that its fees were appropriate for the scope of the work 

required, agreed an audit fee of €27 million for statutory audit services 

in the year (FY22: €23 million).

Non-audit fees

To protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, 

the Committee has a policy for the engagement of the external auditor 

to provide non-audit services. The policy prohibits EY from playing any 

part in management or decision-making, providing certain services such 

as valuation work and the provision of accounting services. The Group’s 

non-audit services policy incorporates the requirements of the FRC’s 

Ethical Standard, including a ‘whitelist’ of permitted non-audit services 

which mirrors the FRC’s Ethical Standard.

The Committee has pre-approved that EY can be engaged by 

management, subject to the policies set out above, and subject to:

 – A €60,000 fee limit for individual engagements;

 – A €500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no legal 

 – A €500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no practical 

alternative; and

alternative supplier.

For those permitted services that exceed these specified fee limits, 

the Committee Chair pre-approves the service.

Non-audit fees were €3 million (FY22: €2 million). See note 3 ‘Operating 

profit’ in the consolidated financial statements.

Letter from Committee Chair
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Vodafone’s ESG 
Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2023.

The Committee was established in 2021 with the founding members 
selected to ensure a range of experience across the range of topics that 
fall within ESG. In November 2022, we welcomed our fourth Committee 
member, Simon Segars. Simon brings significant experience and insights 
to the ESG Committee, including how technology and connectivity are 
reshaping our digital societies. 

On 10 May 2023, it was announced that Valerie Gooding and Dame Clara 
Furse would be retiring following the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. 
I would like to thank them both for their contribution since this Committee 
was established two years ago. Jean-François van Boxmeer and Christine 
Ramon will be joining this Committee on the same date and their insights 
will be an excellent addition to the Committee. 

This year, the Committee met twice, in November 2022 and March 2023. 
Each meeting agenda included a range of topics across the Committee’s 
areas of responsibility. During FY23, the Committee undertook deep dives 
on each of Vodafone’s three purpose pillars, as well as Vodafone’s 
approach to responsible business. These deep dives were supplemented 
by committee training on key Planet-related topics by the Group 
Sustainability team, and other experts across the business.

Now that the Committee has explored each of the key purpose themes 
in detail, we will move into receiving regular updates on progress against 
our key ESG strategy.

In addition to these thematic deep dives, a key focus of the ESG 
Committee this year was oversight of Vodafone’s ESG data transformation 
and disclosure programme. High quality and timely data is a core 

component of a successful ESG strategy, both to ensure that we can 
track progress against targets, and to enable decision-making by 
investors, consumers, suppliers, governments and other stakeholders. 

Recognising this, the Board was pleased to see that management updated 
their approach to ESG reporting this year, by giving joint responsibility 
for ESG reporting to the Group Financial Reporting team and the Group 
Sustainable Business team. This allowed the teams to apply financial 
reporting principles to non-financial ESG data, including establishing a 
control framework and securing external assurance on key data points. 

These changes have already yielded positive changes and set a firm basis 
from which to grow. However we acknowledge that there is a long road 
ahead before ESG disclosures will match similar levels of data quality to 
financial disclosures, not only for Vodafone, but for other corporates too. 
The absence of a clear framework for the calculation and reporting of 
ESG data exacerbates the challenge for all reporters. For example, we 
expect these challenges will come into sharper focus as Scope 3 emission 
reductions become a priority for corporates. 

In November 2022 the Committee reviewed its terms of reference and 
agreed to introduce new joint oversight of selected ESG matters between 
the ESG Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee. This will be 
executed through increased sharing of papers between the committees, 
and a new joint meeting each May to review ESG disclosures.

On behalf of the Committee, I have reported this year’s work to the Board 
and I am looking forward to the next year chairing the Committee, starting 
with the joint ESG Committee and Audit and Risk Committee meeting 
in May 2023.

The Committee will continue oversight and scrutiny of Vodafone’s ESG 
agenda, including further presentations from senior management and 
experts across the Group. We will review against Vodafone’s strategy  
and the pathways in place to achieve Vodafone’s targets across its three 
purpose pillars. Consideration of the following stakeholder interests will 
remain part of the Committee’s responsibility. We set out below some 
of our key stakeholders and examples of their ESG-related interests:

 – Investors: Board-level oversight of Vodafone’s ESG strategy and 

performance is a key part of an effective ESG programme;

 – Governments and regulators: Local and international legal and 

regulatory obligations on ESG topics to increase;

 – Local communities and NGOs: ESG topics affect the day-to-day lives 

of the people in the communities that we serve;

 – Suppliers and customers: Upholding high ethical standards 

throughout our value chain is critical for stakeholders when deciding 
whether they should do business with Vodafone; and

 – Employees: Employees take pride in working for a purpose-driven 

organisation that is enabling an inclusive and sustainable digital society.

We believe the ESG Committee will continue to add value to the 
long-term success of Vodafone, for the benefit of our customers, key 
stakeholders, and the societies in which we operate. I will be available to 
engage with shareholders who have questions or comments about the 
work of the Committee at our 2023 AGM.

Remuneration Committee

Letter from the Remuneration  
Committee Chair
On behalf of the Board, I present our 2023  
Directors’ Remuneration Report.

This report includes both our proposed Policy Report (which will be 
submitted for shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM), and our 2023 
Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out how our current policy 
was implemented during the year under review, and how, subject to its 
approval, our revised policy will be applied for the year ahead.

Remuneration Policy review
Our current Policy Report was approved at the July 2020 AGM, with a 
vote in favour of over 96%. Following the policy entering its third year of 
operation without amendment, the Committee has been reviewing our 
remuneration structures ahead of the regulatory requirement for a new 
policy to be submitted to shareholders at the 2023 AGM.

The Committee is clear that consistency and flexibility should be 
maintained within the new policy and in the event material revisions are 
required before the end of its three-year regulatory lifecycle then the 
Committee will re-engage with shareholders.

Following its review of the current arrangements, which the Committee is 
satisfied remain appropriate and operating as intended, and having made 
a significant number of best practice changes when the policy was last 
renewed, the Committee is not proposing to make any material changes 
at this time.

Instead, some refinements to our framework and the implementation 
of our structures are proposed. These include the review of our 
short-term incentive to more fully support our priorities of Growth and 
Customers (further details of which are provided later in this letter under 
‘Arrangements for 2024’). The Committee is also strengthening our 
clawback policy with the current list of trigger events expanded to 
include a breach of an executive’s restrictive or confidentiality covenants, 
reflecting the importance in our industry of retaining and protecting key 
talent and intellectual property. Clawback time frames are also being 
revised to ensure compliance with the recently announced SEC 
requirements, the vast majority of which our current arrangements 
already complied with.

The implementation of our long-term incentive plan is subject to the 
Global Incentive Plan Rules which were last approved by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM. In line with UK regulations, the Rules need to be approved 
by shareholders at least every 10 years and will be submitted for approval 
at the 2023 AGM. The Committee, with its external legal advisers, has 
reviewed the Rules to ensure they reflect latest market practice.

Engagement during the year
Shareholder feedback has always played a vital role in the development 
of our executive remuneration policy and this is reflected in this year’s 
shareholder consultation. As part of this engagement the Committee 
contacted shareholders with a combined holding of c.50% in Vodafone 
Group Plc. We also actively engaged with a variety of investor bodies and 
proxy agencies before finalising the Policy Report which will be submitted 
for approval at the 2023 AGM. I would like to thank all stakeholders that 
engaged in this year’s review.

In terms of engaging the employee voice, as Workforce Engagement 
Lead, I attended meetings with both our European and African forums, 
with feedback and comments from the meetings subsequently 
presented back directly to the Board. The key topics raised by employee 
representatives this year focused on the cost of living support being 
provided, progress against our Race, Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage 
targets, internal talent development, and our wider business performance. 
I would like to thank the representatives from both forums for inviting 
me and for contributing to the discussions.

Click or scan to watch the Senior Independent Director 
and Chair of the Remuneration Committee explain her 
role: investors.vodafone.com/videos

When looking at the feedback from these forums and our other 
channels of engagement it is evident that our colleagues value the 
open and regular updates the business has given throughout the year, 
and the Board will ensure these continue in the year ahead.

Read more about our stakeholder engagement activities 
on pages 10 to 12 of this Annual Report

Fair pay 
It is recognised that rising inflation levels and the subsequent cost of 
living crisis have impacted colleagues across a number of our markets 
this year. To help alleviate the impact of these pressures, targeted support 
was provided in locations including the UK, Turkey and Egypt. Such 
measures included additional or accelerated salary reviews, the provision 
of extra cash allowances, and the careful consideration of wider market 
conditions when setting salary budgets for the 2023 review.

When making decisions on executive remuneration the Committee 
considers pay in the wider context including arrangements elsewhere 
in the business, our fair pay principles and stakeholder considerations.

Arrangements for 2024
Base salary and pension arrangements
Following her appointment to the position of Group Chief Executive, 
Margherita Della Valle’s salary was set at £1,250,000. The Committee 
decided the new salary was appropriate when compared against the 
external market, was fair from a gender pay perspective given its long 
standing work on fair pay, as referenced above, and reflected both the 
responsibilities and demands of the role.

During the year no additional salary payment or allowance has been 
made to Margherita Della Valle in respect of her carrying out the dual 
roles of Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer. This will 
remain the approach going forward, and it is intended that Margherita will 
continue with her dual responsibilities until the search for a new Group 
Chief Financial Officer is complete.

Pension arrangements for Executive Directors will continue to remain 
aligned with the wider UK workforce at 10% of base salary.

Annual bonus (‘GSTIP’)
In recent years the performance measures have normally been equally 
weighted across service revenue, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted EBIT, 
and customer appreciation. The Committee adjusted these weightings 
ahead of the start of the FY24 plan to ensure performance against the 
strategic priorities of Growth and Customers is fully incentivised.

For the 2024 plan, measures under the annual bonus will be:

 – Growth (70%): service revenue (20%), adjusted EBIT (20%), adjusted 

free cash flow (20%) and revenue market share (10%).

 – Customers (30%): Net Promoter Score (20%), and churn (10%).

Global long-term incentive (‘GLTI’)
Following a comprehensive review of the GLTI structure the Committee 
determined that this will remain unchanged for 2024. The measures 
under the long-term incentive will continue to be weighted at 60% 
adjusted free cash flow, 30% relative TSR and 10% ESG.

Performance outcomes during 2023
GSTIP performance (1 April 2022 – 31 March 2023)
Annual bonus performance during the year was measured against 
both financial and strategic measures. The four measures were equally 
weighted at 25% each, with financial metrics constituting service revenue, 
adjusted EBIT and adjusted free cash flow whilst the strategic measure 
was linked to customer appreciation KPIs. These KPIs covered metrics 
including churn, revenue market share, and Net Promoter Score.

Performance under the service revenue, free cash flow and customer 
appreciation measures was above the mid-point of the target range whilst 
performance against EBIT was below the mid-point. The combined 
performance resulted in an overall bonus payout of 55.8% of maximum.

on pages 94 and 95

GLTI performance (1 April 2020 – 31 March 2023)
The 2021 GLTI award (granted November 2020) was subject to adjusted 
free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award), 
and ESG (10% of total award) performance. All performance conditions 
were measured over the three-year period ending 31 March 2023.

Final adjusted FCF performance finished above the mid-point of the range 
resulting in 72.7% of the adjusted FCF element vesting. Relative TSR 
performance was below the median of the peer group resulting in no 
vesting under this measure. ESG performance was assessed against three 
metrics and vested at 95.3%. This resulted in an overall vesting percentage 
for the 2021 GLTI of 53.2% of maximum.

Consideration of discretion
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the outcomes of 
both the annual bonus and long-term incentive plan in light of both 
the relevant performance targets and wider internal and external 
considerations across the respective measurement periods. Outcomes 
were reviewed against the wider employee experience during the 
periods under review with the Committee noting the steps taken in 
markets to help employees with the cost of living. The Committee also 
acknowledged that no windfall gains had occurred under the long-term 
incentive plan. It was agreed that the outcomes were appropriate and that 
no adjustments were required.

Looking forward
Following the conclusion of the 2023 AGM I will be stepping down as Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee. Amparo Moraleda will be appointed 
as Chair of the Committee and Dame Clara Furse will be stepping down 
as a member of the Committee with effect from the same date. 

The rest of this report sets out both our proposed Policy Report, as will 
be submitted at the 2023 AGM, and our Annual Report on Remuneration, 
which sets out the decisions and outcomes summarised in this letter 
in further detail.

acknowledged that no windfall gains had occurred under the long-term 

incentive plan. It was agreed that the outcomes were appropriate and that 

no adjustments were required.

Looking forward

Following the conclusion of the 2023 AGM I will be stepping down as Chair 

of the Remuneration Committee. Amparo Moraleda will be appointed 

as Chair of the Committee and Dame Clara Furse will be stepping down 

as a member of the Committee with effect from the same date. 

The rest of this report sets out both our proposed Policy Report, as will 

be submitted at the 2023 AGM, and our Annual Report on Remuneration, 

which sets out the decisions and outcomes summarised in this letter 

in further detail.

Remuneration Policy
In this forward-looking section we describe our Remuneration Policy for the Board. This includes our considerations when determining policy, 
a description of the elements of the reward package, including an indication of the potential future value of this package for the Executive Directors, 
and the policy applied to the Chair and Non-Executive Directors.

We will be seeking shareholder approval for our Remuneration Policy at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) and we intend to implement it at that 
point. A summary and explanation of the proposed changes to the current Remuneration Policy is provided on page 85. The proposed Remuneration 
Policy submitted for shareholders’ approval at the 2023 AGM does not differ substantively from the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 
2020 except for changes made to align the terms of the Remuneration Policy with the drafting of the rules of the new Global Incentive Plan 2023, which 
is also being submitted for shareholders’ approval at the 2023 AGM. Subject to approval, we will review our Remuneration Policy each year to ensure that 
it continues to support our Company strategy and, if it is necessary to make a change to our Remuneration Policy within the next three years, we will seek 
prior shareholder approval for the change.

Considerations when determining our Remuneration Policy
To avoid conflicts of interest, the Remuneration Committee is entirely comprised of Non-Executive Directors (who are not eligible to participate in the 
Company’s annual bonus or long-term incentive arrangements) and the Remuneration Committee ensures that individuals are not present when the 
Remuneration Committee discusses their own remuneration. A critical consideration for the Remuneration Committee when determining our 
Remuneration Policy is to ensure that it supports our Company purpose, strategy, and business objectives.

A variety of stakeholder views are taken into account when determining executive pay, including those of our shareholders, colleagues, and external 
bodies. Further details of how we engage with, and consider the views of, each of these stakeholders are set out on page 100.

In advance of submitting our Remuneration Policy for shareholder approval we ran a thorough consultation exercise with our major shareholders. 
We invited our top 25 shareholders (constituting a combined holding of c.50% of our issued share capital at the time of engagement) and a number of 
key governance stakeholders to comment on remuneration at Vodafone and to provide feedback on the proposed changes to the current Remuneration 
Policy which was approved at the 2020 AGM. A number of meetings between shareholders and the Remuneration Committee Chair took place during 
this consultation period. 

Listening to and consulting with our employees is very important and the Remuneration Committee is supportive of the activities undertaken to engage 
the employee voice. Our engagement with employees can take different forms in different markets but includes a variety of channels and approaches 
including our annual people survey which attracts very high levels of participation and engagement, regular business leader Q&A sessions, and a number 
of internal digital communication platforms.

Our Workforce Engagement Lead also undertakes an annual attendance at our European employee forum, and a similar body which covers our African 
markets, with any questions or concerns raised by the employee representatives presented directly to the Board for consideration and discussion. 
Any actions taken by the Board are then fed back to these forums to ensure a two-way dialogue.

Whilst we do not formally consult directly with employees on the Remuneration Policy nor is any fixed remuneration comparison measurement used 
when determining the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee is briefed on pay and employment conditions of 
employees in the Vodafone Group, with particular reference to the market in which the executive is based. The Company operates Sharesave, a UK 
all-employee share plan, as well as other discretionary share-based incentive arrangements, which means that the wider workforce have the opportunity 
to become shareholders in the Company and be able to vote on the Remuneration Policy in the same way as other shareholders. Further information 
on our approach to remuneration for other employees is given on page 90.

Performance measures and targets
Our Company strategy and business objectives are the primary consideration when we are selecting performance measures for our incentive plans. 
The targets within our incentive plans that are related to internal financial measures (such as revenue, profit and cash flow) are typically determined based 
on our budgets. Targets for strategic and external measures (such as customer-focused metrics, ESG measures, and total shareholder return (‘TSR’)) are 
set based on Company objectives and in light of the competitive marketplace. The threshold and maximum levels of performance are set to reflect 
minimum acceptable levels at threshold and very stretching levels at maximum.

As in previous Remuneration Reports, we will disclose the details of our performance metrics for our short- and long-term incentive plans. However, 
our annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and therefore we will only disclose our targets in the Remuneration Report following the completion 
of the financial year. We will normally disclose the targets for each long-term award in the Remuneration Report for the financial year preceding the start 
of the performance period.

At the end of each performance period we review performance against the targets, using judgement to account for items such as (but not limited to) 
mergers, acquisitions, disposals, foreign exchange rate movements, changes in accounting treatment, material one-off tax settlements etc. 
The application of judgement is important to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.

Remuneration Policy (continued)

Malus and clawback
The Remuneration Committee reviews the incentive plan results before any payments are made to executives or any shares vest and has full discretion 
to adjust the final payment or vesting if they believe circumstances warrant it. In particular, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to use either 
malus or clawback as it sees appropriate. In the case of malus, the award may lapse wholly or in part, may vest to a lesser extent than it would otherwise 
have vested or vesting may be delayed.

In the case of clawback, the Remuneration Committee may recover bonus amounts that have been paid up to three years after the relevant payment 
date, or recover share awards that have vested up to five years after the relevant grant date. In line with best practice guidance, the key trigger events 
for the use of the clawback arrangements include material misstatement of results, material miscalculation of performance condition outcomes, the 
Executive Director’s gross misconduct, or breach of their restrictive covenants, the Executive Director causing a material financial loss to the Group as 
a result of reckless or negligent conduct or inappropriate values or behaviour, corporate failure or serious reputational damage.

Subject to approval of this Remuneration Policy, these arrangements will be applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, following the 
2023 AGM. The current clawback arrangements, which are set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM, have been 
applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, since the 2020 AGM.

 – increases elsewhere within the Group; and
 – external comparator groups (which are used for reference purposes only) made up of companies of similar size 

and complexity to Vodafone.

Opportunity

Average salary increases for existing Executive Committee members (including Executive Directors) will not normally exceed 
average increases for employees in other appropriate parts of the Group. Increases above this level may be made in specific 
situations. These situations could include (but are not limited to) internal promotions, changes to role, material changes to the 
business and exceptional Company performance.

Performance metrics

international assignment policies. This may cover (but is not limited to) relocation, cost of living allowance, housing, 
home leave, education support, and tax equalisation and advice.

 – Legal and tax support fees if appropriate.
 – Other benefits are also offered in line with the benefits offered to other employees, for example, our all-employee share 

plan, mobile phone discounts, maternity/paternity benefits, sick leave, paid holiday etc.

Opportunity

 – Benefits will be provided in line with appropriate levels indicated by local market practice in the country of employment, 

though no monetary maximum has been set.

 – We expect to maintain benefits at the current level but the value of any benefit may fluctuate depending on, amongst other 

things, personal situation, insurance premiums and other external factors.

Malus and clawback

The Remuneration Committee reviews the incentive plan results before any payments are made to executives or any shares vest and has full discretion 

to adjust the final payment or vesting if they believe circumstances warrant it. In particular, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to use either 

malus or clawback as it sees appropriate. In the case of malus, the award may lapse wholly or in part, may vest to a lesser extent than it would otherwise 

have vested or vesting may be delayed.

In the case of clawback, the Remuneration Committee may recover bonus amounts that have been paid up to three years after the relevant payment 

date, or recover share awards that have vested up to five years after the relevant grant date. In line with best practice guidance, the key trigger events 

for the use of the clawback arrangements include material misstatement of results, material miscalculation of performance condition outcomes, the 

Executive Director’s gross misconduct, or breach of their restrictive covenants, the Executive Director causing a material financial loss to the Group as 

a result of reckless or negligent conduct or inappropriate values or behaviour, corporate failure or serious reputational damage.

Subject to approval of this Remuneration Policy, these arrangements will be applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, following the 

2023 AGM. The current clawback arrangements, which are set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM, have been 

applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, since the 2020 AGM.

Fixed pay: Benefits

Annual bonus – Global Short-Term Incentive Plan (‘GSTIP’)

Purpose and link 
to strategy

To drive behaviour and communicate the key priorities for the year.

To motivate employees and incentivise delivery of performance over the one-year operating cycle.

The financial metrics drive our growth strategies whilst also focusing on improving operating efficiencies.

The strategic measures aim to ensure a great customer experience remains at the heart of what we do. 

Operation

 – Bonus levels and the appropriateness of measures and weightings are reviewed annually to ensure they continue 

to support our strategy.

 – Performance over the financial year is measured against stretching financial and non-financial performance targets set 

at the start of the financial year.

 – The annual bonus is usually paid in cash in June each year for performance over the previous year. A mandatory deferral 
of 25% of post-tax bonus earned into shares for two years will normally apply except where an Executive Director has met 
or exceeded their share ownership requirement. The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the size of 
the bonus based on the achievement of the relevant performance conditions to reflect the Company’s and the Executive 
Director’s underlying performance and any other factors the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate.

Opportunity

 – Bonuses can range from 0 to 200% of base salary, with 100% paid for on-target performance.

Performance metrics

 – Performance over each financial year is measured against stretching targets set at the beginning of the year.
 – The performance measures normally comprise a mix of financial and strategic measures. Financial measures may include 
(but are not limited to) profit, revenue and cash flow with a weighting of no less than 50%. Strategic measures may include 
(but are not limited to) customer appreciation KPIs such as churn, revenue market share, and NPS.

Long-term incentive – Global Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘GLTI’)

Purpose and link  
to strategy

To motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained performance over the long term.

To support and encourage greater shareholder alignment through a high level of personal share ownership.

The use of free cash flow as the principal performance measure ensures we apply prudent cash management and 
rigorous capital discipline to our investment decisions.

The use of TSR along with a performance period of not less than three years means that we are focused on the 
long-term interests of our shareholders.

The use of ESG metrics reflects the importance of our performance and progress against our long-term ambitions 
in this area.

Operation

 – Award levels and the framework for determining vesting are reviewed annually.
 – Long-term incentive awards consist of awards of shares subject to performance conditions which are granted in respect 

of any financial year.

 – Awards will vest based on Group performance against the performance metrics set out below, measured over a period of 

normally not less than three years. In exceptional circumstances, such as but not limited to where a delay to the grant date 
is required, the Remuneration Committee may set a vesting period of less than three years, although awards will continue 
to be subject to a performance period of at least three years.

 – Awards may be subject to a mandatory two-year post-vesting holding period before the underlying shares can be sold.
 – Dividend equivalents are paid in cash and/or shares by reference to the vesting period (and holding period, if applicable) in 

respect of shares that vest. 

Opportunity

 – Maximum long-term incentive face value at award of 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% for other 

Performance metrics

Executive Directors in respect of any financial year.

 – Threshold long-term incentive face value at award is 20% of maximum opportunity. Minimum vesting is 0% of maximum 

opportunity. Awards vest on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum.

 – The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the extent to which an award vests based on the 

achievement of the relevant performance conditions and to reflect the Company’s and Executive Director’s underlying 
performance and any other factors the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate. In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee has the discretion to reduce long-term incentive grant levels for Executive Directors who have neither met their 
shareholding guideline nor increased their shareholding by 100% of salary during the year.

 – Performance is measured against stretching targets set at the time of grant.
 – Vesting is determined based on the following measures: adjusted free cash flow as our operational performance measure, 

relative TSR against a peer group of companies as our external performance measure, and ESG as a measure of our external 
impact and commitment to our purpose.

 – Weightings will be determined each year and will normally constitute 60% on adjusted free cash flow, 30% on relative total 
shareholder return, and 10% on ESG. The Remuneration Committee will determine the actual weighting of an award prior 
to grant, taking into account all relevant information.

Remuneration Policy (continued)

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table
Existing arrangements
We will honour existing awards, incentives, benefits and contractual arrangements made to individuals prior to their promotion to the Board and/or prior 
to the approval and implementation of this Remuneration Policy. For the avoidance of doubt this includes payments in respect of any award granted under 
any previous Remuneration Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest (or lapse) or the benefits or contractual arrangements no longer apply.

Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’)
When referring to our long-term incentive awards we use the financial year end in which the award was made. For example, the “2023 award” was made 
in the financial year ending 31 March 2023. The awards are usually made in the first half of the financial year.

The extent to which awards vest depends on three performance conditions:

 – underlying operational performance as measured by adjusted free cash flow;
 – relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) against a peer group median; and
 – performance against our Environmental, Social, and Governance (‘ESG’) targets.

Further details of these performance conditions are set out below. The Remuneration Committee reserves the right during the lifetime of the 
Remuneration Policy to change the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards to other financial, shareholder return and strategic metrics, if the 
Remuneration Committee determines that to do so would be in the best interests of the Company. However, in such circumstances, the majority of the 
GLTI awards would continue to remain subject to financial performance targets. The Remuneration Committee would engage with major shareholders 
prior to changing the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards in this way.

Adjusted free cash flow
The free cash flow performance is based on the cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure over the performance period. The detailed targets and 
the definition of adjusted free cash flow are determined each year as appropriate. The target adjusted free cash flow level is set by reference to our 
long-range plan and market expectations. The Remuneration Committee sets these targets to be sufficiently demanding and with significant stretch.

The cumulative adjusted free cash flow vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below 
(with linear interpolation between points):

Performance

Below threshold
Threshold
Maximum

Vesting percentage 
(% of FCF element) 

0%

Relative TSR
We have a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile. As such, the outperformance of the 
median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure. The peer group and outperformance range for the performance condition are 
reviewed each year and amended as appropriate.

The TSR vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear interpolation between 
points):

Vesting percentage

In order to determine the percentages for the equivalent outperformance levels above median, the Remuneration Committee seeks independent 
external advice.

ESG performance
Our ESG targets are set on an annual basis (in accordance with our approach for our other performance measures) and are aligned to our externally 
communicated ambitions in this area. Where performance is below the agreed ambition, the Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to assess 
vesting based on performance against the stated ambition and any other relevant information.

Remuneration policy for other employees
While our remuneration policy follows the same fundamental principles across the Group, packages offered to employees reflect differences in 
market practice in the different countries, role and seniority.

For example, the remuneration package elements for our Executive Committee are essentially the same as for the Executive Directors with some minor 
differences, for example smaller levels of share awards and local variances where appropriate. The remuneration for the next level of management, our 
Senior Leadership Team, again follows the same principles with local and/or individual performance aspects in the annual bonus targets and GLTI awards. 
They also receive lower levels of share awards which are partly delivered in conditional share awards without performance conditions.

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table

Existing arrangements

We will honour existing awards, incentives, benefits and contractual arrangements made to individuals prior to their promotion to the Board and/or prior 

to the approval and implementation of this Remuneration Policy. For the avoidance of doubt this includes payments in respect of any award granted under 

any previous Remuneration Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest (or lapse) or the benefits or contractual arrangements no longer apply.

Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’)

When referring to our long-term incentive awards we use the financial year end in which the award was made. For example, the “2023 award” was made 

in the financial year ending 31 March 2023. The awards are usually made in the first half of the financial year.

The extent to which awards vest depends on three performance conditions:

 – underlying operational performance as measured by adjusted free cash flow;

 – relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) against a peer group median; and

 – performance against our Environmental, Social, and Governance (‘ESG’) targets.

Further details of these performance conditions are set out below. The Remuneration Committee reserves the right during the lifetime of the 

Remuneration Policy to change the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards to other financial, shareholder return and strategic metrics, if the 

Remuneration Committee determines that to do so would be in the best interests of the Company. However, in such circumstances, the majority of the 

GLTI awards would continue to remain subject to financial performance targets. The Remuneration Committee would engage with major shareholders 

prior to changing the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards in this way.

Adjusted free cash flow

The free cash flow performance is based on the cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure over the performance period. The detailed targets and 

the definition of adjusted free cash flow are determined each year as appropriate. The target adjusted free cash flow level is set by reference to our 

long-range plan and market expectations. The Remuneration Committee sets these targets to be sufficiently demanding and with significant stretch.

Estimates of total future potential remuneration from 2024 pay packages
The tables below provide estimates of the potential future remuneration for Executive Directors based on the remuneration opportunity to be granted in 
the 2024 financial year. Potential outcomes based on different performance scenarios are provided in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements.

The assumptions underlying each scenario are described below.

Fixed

Consists of base salary, benefits and pension.

Base salary is at 1 July 2023.

Benefits are valued using the figures in the total remuneration for the 2023 financial year table on page 94 (of the 2023 annual report).

Pensions are valued by applying cash allowance rate of 10% of base salary at 1 July 2023.

Mid-point

Based on what a Director would receive if performance was in line with the Company’s business plan.

The opportunity for the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) is 100% of base salary under this scenario.

The opportunity for the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) reflects assumed achievement mid-way between threshold and 
maximum performance.

Maximum

The maximum award opportunity for the GSTIP is 200% of base salary.

Maximum 
+50%

All scenarios

The maximum GLTI opportunity reflects full vesting based on the maximum award levels set out in this Remuneration Policy  
(i.e. 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer). 

The same assumptions apply as for ‘Maximum’ but with a 50% uplift in the value of the GLTI award.

Long-term incentives consist of share awards only which are measured at face value, i.e. no assumption is made for dividend 
equivalents which may be payable.

Recruitment remuneration
Our approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary and appropriate to attract the right talent to the role.

The Remuneration Policy table (pages 88 and 89) sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package 
for the appointment of an Executive Director. Any new Director’s remuneration package will take into account the elements and constraints of those of 
the existing Directors performing similar roles and the individual circumstances of the new Director. This means a potential maximum bonus opportunity 
of 200% of base salary and long-term incentive maximum face value of opportunity at award of 500% of base salary.

When considering the remuneration arrangements of individuals recruited from external roles to the Board, we will take into account the remuneration 
package of that individual in their prior role. We only provide additional compensation to individuals for awards forgone. If necessary we will seek to 
replicate, as far as practicable, the level and timing of such remuneration, taking into account also any remaining performance requirements applying to it. 
This will be achieved by granting awards of cash or shares that vest over a timeframe similar to those forfeited and, if appropriate, based on performance 
conditions. A commensurate reduction in quantum will be applied where it is determined that the new awards are either not subject to performance 
conditions or subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those of the awards forfeited. Where it is not practicable to grant these 
‘buy-out’ awards using the GLTI rules submitted to shareholders at the 2023 AGM, the Company may grant these awards using bespoke arrangements.

Service contracts of Executive Directors
Executive Directors’ contracts have rolling terms and can be terminated with no more than 12 months’ notice.

The key elements of the service contract for Executive Directors relate to remuneration, payments on loss of office (see next page), and restrictions during 
active employment (and for 12 months thereafter). These restrictions include non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and employees.

Remuneration Policy (continued)

Treatment of corporate events
All of the Company’s share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control of the Company. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest 
and become exercisable on a change of control taking into account, in respect of GLTI awards, the extent to which, in the Remuneration Committee’s 
opinion, any relevant performance conditions are satisfied, the Company’s and the Executive Director’s performance, any other relevant factors and, 
unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed.

In the event of a demerger, distribution (other than an ordinary dividend) or other transaction which would affect the current or future value of any award, 
the Remuneration Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a change of control described above. Alternatively, an adjustment may 
be made to the number of shares if considered appropriate.

Payments for departing Executive Directors
In the table below we summarise the key elements of our Remuneration Policy on payments for loss of office. We will always comply both with the relevant plan 
rules and local employment legislation. The Remuneration Committee may make any statutory payment that is required in any relevant jurisdiction.

(‘GSTIP’) on

Treatment of

 – 12 months’ notice from the Company to the Executive Director.
 – Up to 12 months’ base salary and contractual benefits (in line with the notice period). Notice period payments will either be made 
as normal (if the Executive Director continues to work during the notice period or is on gardening leave) or they will be made as 
monthly payments in lieu of notice (subject to mitigation if alternative employment is obtained).

 – The annual bonus may be pro-rated for the period of service during the financial year and will reflect the extent to which Company 

performance has been achieved. The annual bonus may be paid in such proportions of cash and shares, and subject to such 
deferral arrangements, as the Remuneration Committee may determine.

 – The Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust the entitlement to an annual bonus to reflect the individual’s performance 

and the circumstances of the termination.

 – Normally, unvested GLTI awards will lapse when an Executive Director leaves the Group. However, an Executive Director’s award will 

vest in accordance with the terms of the plan to the extent determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account 
applicable performance conditions, the underlying performance of the Company and of the Executive Director and any other relevant 
factors, if the Executive Director dies in service or leaves because of their ill health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or the 
sale of their employing company or business out of the Group or for any other reason determined by the Remuneration Committee, 
more than five months after the month in which the award is granted. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine 
whether the award will vest at the normal vesting date or earlier. The Remuneration Committee will determine the satisfaction of 
performance conditions applicable to the award. Awards will, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, be pro-rated 
for the proportion of the vesting period that had elapsed at the date the Executive Director leaves the Group.

 – The Remuneration Committee has discretion to vary the level of vesting as deemed appropriate, and in particular to determine that 

awards should not vest for reasons which may include, at their absolute discretion, departure in case of poor performance, 
departure without the agreement of the Board, or detrimental competitive activity.

Pension and 
benefits

 – Generally pension and benefit provisions will continue to apply until the termination date.
 – Where appropriate other benefits may be receivable, such as (but not limited to) payments in lieu of accrued holiday, legal fees, 

tax advice costs in relation to the termination and outplacement support.

 – Benefits of relatively small value may continue after termination where appropriate, such as (but not limited to) mobile phone provision.

In exceptional circumstances, an arrangement may be established specifically to facilitate the exit of a particular individual albeit that any such 
arrangement would be made within the context of minimising the cost to the Group. We will only take such a course of action in exceptional 
circumstances and where it is considered to be in the best interests of shareholders.

Chair and Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
Our policy is for the Chair to review the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors annually following consultation with the Remuneration Committee 
Chair. Fees for the Chair are set by the Remuneration Committee.

Element

Policy

Fees

 – We aim to pay competitively for the role including consideration of the time commitment required. We benchmark the fees against an 

appropriate external comparator group. We pay a fee to our Chair which includes fees for chair of any committees. We pay a fee to each of our 
other Non-Executive Directors and they may receive an additional fee if they chair or are a member of a committee and/or hold the position of 
Senior Independent Director (although the Remuneration Committee does not currently intend to award additional fees for serving on a Board 
committee, other than for chairing that committee). Non-Executive Directors’ fee levels are set within the maximum level as approved by 
shareholders as part of our Articles of Association. We review the structure of fees from time to time and may, as appropriate, make changes to 
the manner in which total fees are structured, including but not limited to any additional chair or membership fees.

Allowances

 – Under a legacy arrangement, an allowance is payable each time certain non-Europe-based Non-Executive Directors are required to travel 

to attend Board and committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved. 

Incentives
Benefits

 – Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive plans. 
 – Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any benefit plans. The Company does not provide any contribution to their 

pension arrangements. The Chair is entitled to the use of a car and a driver whenever and wherever they are providing their services to or 
representing the Company. We have been advised that for Non-Executive Directors, certain travel and accommodation expenses in relation 
to attending Board meetings should be treated as a taxable benefit, therefore we also cover the tax liability for these expenses. 

Non-Executive Director letters of appointment
Non-Executive Directors are engaged on letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. The appointment of Non-Executive Directors 
may be terminated without compensation. Non-Executive Directors are generally not expected to serve for a period exceeding nine years. For further 
information refer to the Nominations and Governance Committee section of the Annual Report.

Annual Report on Remuneration

Remuneration Committee
In this section we give details of the composition of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) and activities undertaken during the 2023 financial 
year. The Committee’s function is to exercise independent judgement and consists only of the following independent Non-Executive Directors:

Chair: Valerie Gooding  
Committee members: Delphine Ernotte Cunci (appointed 8 November 2022), Michel Demaré and Dame Clara Furse

Following the announcement on 10 May 2023, Valerie Gooding and Dame Clara Furse will be stepping down from the Committee with effect from the 
conclusion of the 2023 AGM. Amparo Moraleda will join as Committee Chair with effect from the same date.

The Committee regularly consults with Margherita Della Valle, who was appointed as the Group Chief Executive effective 27 April 2023 (and also held 
the position on an interim basis effective 1 January 2023) and Leanne Wood, the Chief Human Resources Officer, on various matters relating to the 
appropriateness of awards for Executive Directors and senior executives, though they are not present when their own compensation is discussed. 
In addition, James Ludlow, the Group Reward and Policy Director, provides a perspective on information provided to the Committee, and requests 
information and analysis from external advisers as required. Maaike de Bie, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, advises the Committee 
on corporate governance guidelines and is Secretary to the Committee.

External advisers
The Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. The appointed advisers, WTW, were appointed 
by the Committee in 2007. The Chair of the Committee has direct access to these advisers as and when required, and the Committee determines the 
protocols by which these advisers interact with management in support of the Committee. The advice and recommendations of the external advisers are 
used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Committee member. Advisers attend Committee 
meetings occasionally, as and when required by the Committee.

WTW is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of 
Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. This is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due 
care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. WTW has confirmed that it adheres to that Code of Conduct throughout the year for all 
remuneration services provided to Vodafone and therefore the Committee is satisfied that it is independent and objective. The Remuneration Consultants’ 
Group Code of Conduct is available at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.

2023 remuneration
In this section we summarise the pay packages awarded to our Executive Directors for performance in the 2023 financial year versus 2022. Specifically, 
we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total remuneration 
figure for the year. The value of the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) reflects what was earned in respect of the year but will be paid out in cash in the following year. 
Similarly the value of the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) reflects the share awards which will vest in August 2023 as a result of the performance through the 
three-year period ended at the completion of our financial year on 31 March 2023.

Consideration of the use of discretion
The Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments of performance are 
fair and appropriate. If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting.

The Committee reviewed incentive outcomes at the May 2023 meeting and considered the appropriateness of outcomes in light of wider financial and 
business performance and the wider employee experience across the relevant measurement periods for both the short-term and long-term incentive 
plans. The Committee agreed the outcomes were appropriate and that no adjustments were required to either the short-term or long-term incentive 
outcomes this year,

Board changes
Throughout the year under review Margherita Della Valle held the position of Chief Financial Officer and, prior to her permanent appointment as Group 
Chief Executive on 27 April 2023, was also appointed Group Chief Executive on an interim basis effective 1 January 2023. Margherita’s 2023 single figure 
therefore reflects remuneration received in respect of her time in both of these executive positions, whereas her 2022 single figure reflects remuneration 
received solely in respect of her role as Chief Financial Officer.

In line with the reporting regulations, the single figure for Nick Read reflects remuneration received in respect of services rendered as a Board Director 
(i.e. from 1 April 2022 to 31 December 2022). The single figure table and supporting notes do not include values in respect of Nick’s employment 
between 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2023 nor contractual loss of office payments which can instead be found on page 99.

Financial metrics
As set out in the table above, service revenue and free cash flow finished above the mid-points of the respective target ranges whilst EBIT finished below 
the mid-point of the respective target range.

Customer appreciation KPIs
An assessment of performance under the customer appreciation KPIs measure was conducted on a market-by-market basis. Each market was assessed 
against a number of different metrics which included:

 – Churn – defined as total gross customer disconnections in the period divided by the average total customers in the period.
 – Revenue market share – based on our total service revenue and that of our competitors in the markets we operate in.
 – Net Promoter Score (‘NPS’) for both Consumer and Vodafone Business – defined as the extent to which our customers would recommend us.

All measures utilise data from our local markets which is collected and validated for quality and consistency by independent third-party agencies where 
possible. Further details on our performance against each key metric is set out below.

The business recorded positive churn results despite difficult and volatile market conditions linked to increasing price pressures. We experienced positive 
results across both mobile and fixed services in Portugal, and it was a particularly strong year for mobile churn in Italy, Turkey and South Africa. Network 
challenges in markets including Albania meant fixed service performance was more mixed although customer loyalty remained strong in a number of 
markets including the UK. 

 We continued to perform against revenue market share despite fierce competition across our markets. Strong performance was recorded in the UK, 
Egypt, Romania, and Ireland all of which demonstrated competitive resilience against this backdrop. Intense competition and increasing price pressures, 
particularly in some of our larger European markets, was also reflected in our overall position against this metric. 

Consumer NPS performance during the year saw us retain market leader or co-leader positions in several markets including Italy and Egypt, with Portugal, 
Albania and Tanzania all retaining a significant lead. We also improved or defended our position to ‘next-best’ competitor in the UK, Spain and South Africa, 
although faced challenges in Greece and Turkey.

Stable Business NPS performance was recorded in the year, reflected in leading positions retained or strengthened in several markets, including South 
Africa, Portugal and Albania. While there remains some market difficulties in Egypt and Spain, we have seen advancements in markets like Italy where we 
have attained a market leader position.

It is within this context that overall performance against our customer appreciation KPI metrics during the year was judged to be above the mid-point of 
the target range. The aggregated performance for the Group is calculated on a revenue-weighted average to give an overall achievement. The overall 
Group achievement for the year was 55.0% of maximum.

In this section we summarise the pay packages awarded to our Executive Directors for performance in the 2023 financial year versus 2022. Specifically, 

we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total remuneration 

figure for the year. The value of the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) reflects what was earned in respect of the year but will be paid out in cash in the following year. 

Similarly the value of the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) reflects the share awards which will vest in August 2023 as a result of the performance through the 

three-year period ended at the completion of our financial year on 31 March 2023.

Consideration of the use of discretion

The Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments of performance are 

fair and appropriate. If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting.

The Committee reviewed incentive outcomes at the May 2023 meeting and considered the appropriateness of outcomes in light of wider financial and 

business performance and the wider employee experience across the relevant measurement periods for both the short-term and long-term incentive 

plans. The Committee agreed the outcomes were appropriate and that no adjustments were required to either the short-term or long-term incentive 

outcomes this year,

Board changes

Throughout the year under review Margherita Della Valle held the position of Chief Financial Officer and, prior to her permanent appointment as Group 

Chief Executive on 27 April 2023, was also appointed Group Chief Executive on an interim basis effective 1 January 2023. Margherita’s 2023 single figure 

therefore reflects remuneration received in respect of her time in both of these executive positions, whereas her 2022 single figure reflects remuneration 

received solely in respect of her role as Chief Financial Officer.

In line with the reporting regulations, the single figure for Nick Read reflects remuneration received in respect of services rendered as a Board Director 

(i.e. from 1 April 2022 to 31 December 2022). The single figure table and supporting notes do not include values in respect of Nick’s employment 

between 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2023 nor contractual loss of office payments which can instead be found on page 99.

– Private healthcare (2023: Margherita Della Valle £2,575, Nick Read £1,931; 2022: Margherita Della Valle £2,153, 2022: Nick Read £2,189); 

– Travel (2023: Margherita Della Valle £4,235, Nick Read £22,127; 2022: Margherita Della Valle £1,141, Nick Read £20,626).

2.  The share prices used for the 2022 and 2023 values, as set out in note 3 below, are lower than the grant prices for the respective awards. As such, no amount of the value shown in the 2022 or 2023 

column is attributable to share price appreciation during the performance or vesting periods.

3.  The value shown in the 2022 column is the award which vested on 26 June 2022 in respect of Nick Read and Margherita Della Valle, and is valued using the execution share price on 26 June 2022 of 126.82 

pence. The value shown in the 2023 column is the award which vests on 3 August 2023 and is valued using an average closing share price over the last quarter of the 2023 financial year of 93.85 pence.

4.  Margherita Della Valle and Nick Read receive a cash award equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period on any shares that vest. The dividend value shown in 

2023 relates to awards vesting on 3 August 2023.

5.  Reflects the value of the SAYE benefit which is calculated as £375 x 20% per monthly contribution to reflect the discount applied based on savings made during the year.

2023 annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) payout (audited)

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)

The adjusted free cash flow for the three-year period ended on 31 March 
2023 was €16.0 billion and equates to vesting under the FCF element 
of 72.7% of maximum.

The chart to the right shows that our TSR performance over the 
three-year period ended on 31 March 2023 was below the median 
of the peer group resulting in no vesting under this measure.

ESG performance across our three metrics was as follows:

 – GHG reduction – GHG reduction of 65% as at 31 March 2023 

from the FY17 baseline.

 – Women In Management – 34% representation of women 

in management at 31 March 2023.

 – M-Pesa – 53.2m connections at 31 March 2023.

The Committee reviewed the above performance and determined vesting 
under the ESG element of 95.3% of maximum. This reflected full 
achievement under the GHG reduction metric where the ambition was 
exceeded and the Women in Management metric where the ambition 
was achieved, and partial vesting under the M-Pesa metric where strong 
progress against the stretching ambition was made.

Notes:
1.  GLTI awards were granted as conditional share awards over shares with a value equal to the percentages of salary referred to on page 86. Margherita’s maximum vesting reflects the 2023 GLTI award made 
in July 2022 and the subsequent top-up GLTI award made in February 2023 following her change in role. Nick’s maximum vesting reflects the number of shares granted at maximum in July 2022 and 
which will be pro-rated for time worked (see page 99 for further details). Dividend equivalents on the shares that vest are paid in cash after the vesting date.

2.  Face value calculated based on the closing share price on 26 July 2022 (day immediately preceding the date of the July grant) of 122.4 pence. This share price was also used when calculating Margherita’s 

February 2023 grant.

Outstanding awards
The structure for awards made in August 2021 (vesting August 2024) and July 2022 (vesting July 2025) is set out on the previous page. Further details of 
the structure of these awards, and relevant targets, can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration of the relevant year.

All-employee share plans
During the year the Executive Directors were eligible to participate in the Vodafone Group Sharesave Plan which is a HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) 
approved scheme. Options under the plan are granted at up to a 20% discount to market value and Executive Directors’ participation is included in the 
option table on page 99.

Pensions (audited)
During the 2023 financial year, Margherita Della Valle accrued benefits under the defined contribution pension plan of £3,999.96, with the remainder of 
her 10% of base salary pension benefit for the year delivered as a cash allowance. Nick Read received a pro-rated cash allowance of 10% of base salary.

Margherita Della Valle has not participated in a Vodafone sponsored defined benefit scheme during her employment. Nick Read is a deferred member of 
the Vodafone Group Pension Scheme which closed to future accrual in 2010 before he was an Executive Director.

The Executive Directors are provided benefits in the event of death in service. In the event of ill health, an entitlement to benefit of two-thirds of base 
salary, up to a maximum benefit determined by the insurer, may be provided up until state pension age. In respect of the Executive Committee members, 
the Group has made aggregate contributions of £147,507 (2022: £143,175) into defined contribution pension schemes.

Alignment to shareholder interests (audited) 
Share ownership levels and requirements for individuals who held the position of Executive Director are set out in the table below. The values in respect of 
Margherita Della Valle reflect her ownership requirement as at 31 March 2023. Following her permanent appointment as Group Chief Executive on 27 
April 2023, Margherita’s ownership requirement was increased to 500% of salary.

As shown in the chart below, Margherita increased her shareholding level during the year but due to share price movement (93.85 pence for the 31 
March 2023 measurement compared to 126.61 pence used for the 2022 measurement), saw her ownership, as a percentage of salary and as calculated 
for these reporting purposes, decrease.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)

The shareholding requirements include a post-employment condition whereby the Executive Directors will need to continue to hold shares equivalent 
to the value of their requirement at the date of departure (or actual holding on departure if the requirement has not been reached during employment) 
for a further two years post-employment. The Committee has a number of processes in place to ensure this condition is met, including executives 
agreeing to these terms prior to receiving an award, executives holding the majority of their shares (and at least up to the value of their requirement) 
in a Company accessible account, and the Committee having the ability to lapse any unvested GLTI awards if the condition is not met.

Collectively the Executive Committee, including the Executive Director, owned 23,565,656 Vodafone shares at 31 March 2023, with a value of over 
£22.1 million. None of the Executive Committee members’ shareholdings amounts to more than 1% of the issued shares in that class of share, excluding 
treasury shares.

1.  This includes certain travel and accommodation expenses in relation to attending Board meetings which are treated as a taxable benefit. Values include these travel expenses and the corresponding tax 

contribution. 

The shareholding requirements include a post-employment condition whereby the Executive Directors will need to continue to hold shares equivalent 

to the value of their requirement at the date of departure (or actual holding on departure if the requirement has not been reached during employment) 

for a further two years post-employment. The Committee has a number of processes in place to ensure this condition is met, including executives 

agreeing to these terms prior to receiving an award, executives holding the majority of their shares (and at least up to the value of their requirement) 

in a Company accessible account, and the Committee having the ability to lapse any unvested GLTI awards if the condition is not met.

Collectively the Executive Committee, including the Executive Director, owned 23,565,656 Vodafone shares at 31 March 2023, with a value of over 

£22.1 million. None of the Executive Committee members’ shareholdings amounts to more than 1% of the issued shares in that class of share, excluding 

treasury shares.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)

Pay in the wider context
Fair pay at Vodafone
As part of its review of executive remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes account of the pay policies in place across the wider business. 
This includes considering the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business to ensure there is a strong rationale for how packages 
evolve across the different levels of the organisation.

During the year the Committee reviewed the remuneration structure across the business, which included how our arrangements aligned with our 
strategy, supported our purpose, and celebrated the Spirit of Vodafone. The update also set out the results of the latest annual fair pay review, including 
where the key focus areas were and what actions had been agreed locally to implement any required adjustments.

In addition to being a core principle of the Committee, there is a clear culture in our business of ensuring we offer competitive and fair pay to all our 
people. Our approach across our business is guided by the six principles set out below. Our commitment to these principles is reflected in how the 
UK-based Living Wage Foundation has certified us as an Accredited Living Wage employer.

1. Market competitive
The pay of our people is reflective of their skills, role and function and the external market.

We annually review the pay of each person and actively manage any who fall below the market competitive range.

2. Free from discrimination
Our pay should not be affected by gender, age, disability, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, cultural heritage or belief.

We annually compare the average position of our men and women against their market benchmark, grade and function to identify and understand any 
differences and take action if necessary.

3. Ensure a good standard of living
We work with an independent organisation, the Fair Wage Network, to assess how our pay compares to the ‘living wage’ in each of our markets because 
we are committed to providing a good standard of living for our people and their families.

4. Share in our successes
All our people should have the opportunity to share in our success by being eligible to receive some form of performance-related pay, e.g. a bonus, shares 
or sales incentive.

5. Provide benefits for all
Our global standard is to offer all our people life insurance, parental leave and access to either Company or state provided healthcare and pension 
provision.

6. Open and transparent
We ensure that our people understand their pay. We do this through a series of user-friendly guides, webpages and an annual reward statement, which 
help explain our people’s pay and outline the value of their core reward package.

In addition, our people also receive monthly or weekly payslips and a payment schedule.

Cost of living actions
It is recognised that rising inflation levels and the subsequent cost of living crisis have impacted employees across a number of our markets this year. 
We have provided targeted support in a number of these locations, including the UK, Turkey and Egypt, to help alleviate the impact of these pressures 
and continue to monitor the market conditions across all of our locations’ entities. Such measures included additional or accelerated salary reviews, the 
provision of extra cash allowances, and the careful consideration of wider market conditions when setting salary budgets for the 2023 review. In the UK 
specifically, additional support has been provided to lower-paid employees who have been particularly impacted by increases to the consumer price 
index. This included a 10% base salary increase to employees with salaries of less than £25,000, whilst employees with a base salary of between £25,000 
and £35,000 received a £1,000 cash payment.

Stakeholder engagement
The Committee considers all stakeholder groups when setting executive pay including:

Employees
The Committee is fully briefed on pay arrangements across the business to ensure any decisions on executive pay are made within our wider business 
context and take into account wider employee pay conditions. We engage with our employees through a variety of means including employee forums, 
interactive webinars (including with our executives), global Spirit Beat surveys and digital platforms, all of which give our people the chance to voice their 
opinion on any area of interest, including all-employee and executive pay.

Shareholders
The Committee values the active participation of our shareholders during our consultations and fully considers all feedback as part of the review process.

Government
The Committee actively engages with external professional bodies and government departments when they issue consultations on proposed changes to 
legislation or reporting guidelines.

Wider society
The Committee is fully aware that society remains concerned about the risk of excessive executive pay practices in the wider market. The Committee 
believes that transparent reporting and active engagement in explaining both the operation of, and rationale for, executive pay decisions is key for 
businesses to retain trust in this area.

UK gender pay gap reporting
Each year we publish our UK gender pay gap in line with the statutory UK methodology. The nature of the statutory calculation means the gap will 
fluctuate year on year, influenced by changes in our business structure, Company performance and the percentage of men and women at all levels and 
positions. The existence of a UK gender pay gap in our business is primarily a consequence of more men than women holding senior or specialist, and 
therefore higher-paid, roles.

With our commitment to embed an inclusive culture, we continue our work to reduce the gap and have made good progress since the publication of 
our first report in 2017. Our global programmes aim to support women across different roles, areas, and geographies of our business and will, over time, 
reduce our specific UK gender pay gap which this year was calculated as 10.4% – a slight increase from our 2021 figure of 9.6%.

We have been recognised by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index as a leader in creating equity for women. We are proud of the policies that we have 
put in place to support our employees and we remain committed to addressing female representation at senior levels and the gender pay gap.

The calculation methodology used reflects Option B as defined under the relevant regulations. In line with the relevant regulations this utilises the most 
recently collected and disclosed data analysed within our Gender Pay Gap report, with employees at the three quartiles identified from this analysis and 
their respective single figure values calculated.

To ensure this data accurately reflects individuals at such quartiles, the single figure values for individuals immediately above and below the identified 
employee at each quartile within the gender pay gap analysis were also reviewed.

In recent years our ratios have remained relatively consistent, reflecting how the single figures for both the Chief Executive and employees at the quartile 
positions have remained stable when viewed over the period set out in the table above. In general we expect the ratios to be primarily driven by the 
valuation of the long-term incentive that is included in the Chief Executive’s single figure for the year.

Change in remuneration for Directors and all employees
In line with regulatory requirements, the table below calculates the percentage change in Directors’ remuneration (salary, taxable benefits and annual 
bonus payment) compared to the average remuneration for other Vodafone Group employees who are measured on comparable business objectives 
and who have been employed in the UK since 2021 (2021 to 2022) and 2022 (2022 to 2023) (per capita). Vodafone has employees based all around the 
world and some of these individuals work in countries with very high salary inflation; therefore Vodafone’s UK-based Group employees are deemed the 
most appropriate employee group for this comparison.

The year-on-year increase in Margherita Della Valle’s pay reflects Margherita’s appointment as Group Chief Executive on an interim basis, in addition to her 
existing role as Chief Financial Officer, effective 1 January 2023. This change in role during the year under review is therefore reflected in Margherita’s 
2023 figures compared to the 2022 figures which reflect Margherita’s role as Chief Financial Officer. The percentage increase in the table above does not 
reflect the actual increase during the year under review in respect of the salary payable for the role of Chief Executive which was increased by 3% effective 
1 July 2022.

The significant year-on-year increase in Deborah Kerr’s fees and taxable benefits reflect how the 2022 values reflect one month of service which covers 
the period between Deborah joining on 1 March 2022 and the year-end on 31 March 2022. By comparison, the 2023 figures reflect a full 12 months 
of time worked therefore resulting in a high year-on-year percentage increase despite there being no actual increase in the fees payable to the 
Non-Executive Directors during this period.

Whilst some of the percentages within the ‘Taxable benefits’ column look significant, these actually reflect relatively small increases in value when viewed 
on an absolute basis. Where an individual had no taxable benefit values in 2022 it has not been possible to calculate a percentage for the table above.

Assessing pay and performance
In the table below we summarise the Chief Executive’s single figure remuneration over the past 10 years and how our variable pay plans have paid 
out in relation to the maximum opportunity. This can be compared with the historic TSR performance over the same period. The chart below shows 
the performance of the Company relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Index over a 10-year period. The STOXX Europe 600 Index was selected as this 
is a broad-based index that includes many of our closest competitors. It should be noted that the TSR element of the 2021 GLTI is based on the TSR 
performance shown in the chart on page 96 and not this chart.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)

2024 remuneration
Details of how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for the 2024 financial year are set out below.

Prior to reviewing executive remuneration arrangements, including those of the Executive Committee, the Committee was fully briefed on remuneration 
arrangements elsewhere in the business. This included a detailed discussion of the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business, how 
pay at these levels is determined, and the findings of the latest annual fair pay review. The Committee also considered the external context and decisions 
made in relation to our wider employee population.

The cumulative effect of these discussions was that the Committee was able to make decisions in respect of executive remuneration in the context of the 
wider employee pay landscape within the business.1

2024 base salaries

Following her appointment to the position of Group Chief Executive, Margherita Della Valle’s salary was set at £1,250,000. The Committee decided the 
new salary was appropriate when compared against the external market using the Committee’s normal comparator groups of the EuroTop 25-75 and 
FTSE 30 (both excluding financial services companies), was fair from a gender pay perspective given its long standing work on fair pay and reflected both 
the responsibilities and demands of the role.

During the year no additional salary payment or allowance has been made to Margherita in respect of her carrying out the dual roles of Group Chief 
Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer. This will remain the approach going forward, and it is intended that Margherita will continue with her dual 
responsibilities until a new Group Chief Financial Officer is appointed.

Pension

Pension arrangements for Executive Directors will remain unchanged at 10% of salary, in line with the maximum employer contribution level for the wider 
UK population.

2024 annual bonus (‘GSTIP’)

Following its annual review of the GSTIP structure, the Committee agreed that the 2024 plan should support the strategic priorities of Growth and 
Customers. The constituent performance measures remain unchanged with the key change from the 2023 plan being separation of Net Promoter Score, 
revenue market share, and churn into standalone measures. The performance measures and weightings for 2024 are outlined below:

Growth (70% of total)
Service revenue (20%); adjusted EBIT (20%); adjusted free cash flow (20%); and revenue market share (10%)

Customers (30% of total)
Net Promoter Score1 (20%); and churn (10%).
Note:
1.  The assessment of NPS utilises data collected in our local markets which is validated for quality and consistency by independent third-party agencies.

Due to the potential impact on our commercial interests, annual bonus targets are considered commercially sensitive and therefore will be disclosed 
in the 2024 Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year.

Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) awards for 2024

Awards for 2024 will be made in line with the arrangements described in our policy on pages 89 and 90. Vesting of the 2024 award will be subject to 
adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award), and ESG (10% of total award) performance. Performance will be measured 
over the three financial years ending 31 March 2026, and any net vested shares will be subject to an additional two-year holding period. It is anticipated 
that the final awards will be reviewed by the Committee at the July 2023 meeting and, subject to the Committee’s approval, will be granted shortly 
afterwards.

Further details of the 2024 award targets are provided are on the following page.

Relative TSR (30% of total award)
Following the annual review of the performance measures which included a review of analysis provided by the Committee’s external advisers, 
the Committee determined that the TSR outperformance range for the 2024 award should be set at 7.0% p.a. at maximum.

The Committee further determined that the TSR peer group should remain unchanged for the 2024. Further details are set out in the tables below.

Each ambition for the 2024 award has been set by considering both our externally communicated targets and our internal progress as at 31 March 2023.

At the end of the performance period the Committee will assess achievement across the three metrics against the stated ambitions and determine 
vesting under this element. Full disclosure of the rationale for the final vesting decision will be provided in the relevant Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Our US listing requirements

2024 remuneration for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors

Fees for our Chair and Non-Executive Directors have been benchmarked against the FTSE 30 (excluding financial services companies). Following this 

year’s review it was agreed that the current fee levels, which are set out in the table below, would remain unchanged.

As Vodafone’s American Depositary Shares are listed on NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (‘NASDAQ’), we are required to disclose a summary of any material 
differences between the corporate governance practices we follow and those of US companies listed on NASDAQ. Vodafone’s corporate governance 
practices are primarily based on UK requirements but substantially conform to those required of US companies listed on NASDAQ.

The material differences are set out in the following table:

Board member independence

Committees

Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct

Quorum

Related party transactions

Shareholder approval

Different tests of independence for Board members are applied under the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and the NASDAQ listing rules. The Board is not required to take 
into consideration NASDAQ’s detailed definitions of independence as set out in the NASDAQ listing 
rules. The Board has carried out an assessment based on the independence requirements of the Code 
and has determined that, in its judgement, each of Vodafone’s Non-Executive Directors is independent 
within the meaning of those requirements.

The NASDAQ listing rules require US companies to have a nominations committee, an audit 
committee and a compensation committee, each composed entirely of independent directors, with 
the nominations committee and the audit committee each required to have a written charter which 
addresses the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, and the compensation committee having sole 
authority and adequate funding to engage compensation consultants, independent legal counsel and 
other compensation advisers.

 – Our Nominations and Governance Committee is chaired by the Chair of the Board and its other 

members are independent Non-Executive Directors.

 – Our Remuneration Committee is composed entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors.

 – Our Audit and Risk Committee is composed entirely of Non-Executive Directors, each of whom 

(i) the Board has determined to be independent based on the independence requirements of the 
Code; and (ii) meets the independence requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 – We have terms of reference for our Nominations and Governance Committee, Audit and Risk 

Committee and Remuneration Committee, all of which comply with the requirements of the Code 
and are available for inspection on our website at vodafone.com/governance.

 – These terms of reference are generally responsive to the relevant NASDAQ listing rules, but may not 

address all aspects of these rules.

Under the NASDAQ listing rules, US companies must adopt a Code of Conduct applicable to all 
directors, officers and employees that complies with the definition of a ‘Code of Ethics’ set out in 
section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 – We have adopted a Code of Ethics that complies with section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which 

is applicable only to the senior financial and principal executive officers.

Click to read our Code of Ethics: 
vodafone.com/governance

 – We have also adopted a separate Code of Conduct which applies to all employees. 

The quorum required for shareholder meetings, in accordance with our Articles of Association, is two 
shareholders, regardless of the level of their aggregate share ownership, while US companies listed 
on NASDAQ are required by the NASDAQ listing rules to have a minimum quorum of 33.33% of the 
holders of ordinary shares for shareholder meetings.

In lieu of obtaining an independent review of related party transactions for conflicts of interests 
in accordance with the NASDAQ listing rules, we seek shareholder approval for related party 
transactions that (i) meet certain financial thresholds, or (ii) have unusual features in accordance with 
the Listing Rules issued by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK (the ‘Listing Rules’), 
the Companies Act 2006 and our Articles of Association.

Further, we use the definition of a transaction with a related party as set out in the Listing Rules, which 
differs in certain respects from the definition of related party transaction in the NASDAQ listing rules.

When determining whether shareholder approval is required for a proposed transaction, we comply 
with both the NASDAQ listing rules and the Listing Rules. Under the NASDAQ listing rules, whether 
shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, among other things, the percentage 
of shares to be issued or sold in connection with the transaction. Under the Listing Rules, whether 
shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, among other things, whether the size 
of a transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the size of the listed company undertaking 
the transaction.

Directors’ statement of responsibility

The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations and keeping proper accounting 
records. Detailed below are statements made by 
the Directors in relation to their responsibilities, 
disclosure of information to the Company’s auditor, 
going concern and management’s report on 
internal control over financial reporting.

Financial statements and accounting records
Company law of England and Wales requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group at the end 
of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing those financial statements the Directors are required to:

 – Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
 – Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – Present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;

 – State whether the consolidated financial statements have been 

prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting 
Standards (‘IAS’), with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(‘IASB’) and with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 
2006 (the ‘Act’);

 – State for the Company’s financial statements whether applicable 

UK accounting standards have been followed; and

 – Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will 
continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with UK-adopted IAS, with IFRS as issued by the IASB and with the 
requirements of the Act. They are also responsible for the system 
of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group, and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ responsibility statement
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 
65 to 67, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:

 – The consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance 

with UK-adopted IAS, with IFRS as issued by the IASB and with the 
requirements of the Act, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group;

 – The parent company financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Company; and

 – The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 

performance of the business and the position of the Group, together 
with a description and robust assessment of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

The Directors are also responsible under section 172 of the Companies 
Act 2006 to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of 
its members as a whole and in doing so have regard for the needs of 
wider society and stakeholders, including customers, consistent with 
the Group’s core and sustainable business objectives.

Having taken advice from the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board 
considers the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and that it provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

Neither the Company nor the Directors accepts any liability to any person 
in relation to the Annual Report except to the extent that such liability 
could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person 
who has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading statement 
or omission shall be determined in accordance with section 90A and 
schedule 10A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

Disclosure of information to the auditors
Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of 
the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and 
the Directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.

Directors’ statement of responsibility (continued)

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, performance, position, principal risks and 
uncertainties and the Directors’ assessment of its long-term viability are 
set out on page 57.

In addition, the funding position of the Group is included in ‘Borrowings’ 
and ‘Capital and financial risk management’ in notes 21 and 22, 
respectively, to the consolidated financial statements. Notes 21 and 
22 include disclosure in relation to the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing as well as details regarding its capital, its financial 
risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
As noted on pages 177 to 178, the Group has access to substantial cash 
and financing facilities.

The Group also believes it adequately manages or mitigates its solvency 
and liquidity risks through two primary processes, described below.

Business planning process and performance management
The Group’s forecasting and planning cycle consists of in-year forecasts, 
a budget and a long-range plan. These generate income statement, cash 
flow and net debt projections for assessment by Group management 
and the Board. Each forecast is compared with prior forecasts and actual 
results to identify variances and understand the drivers of the changes 
and their future impact so management can take action where 
appropriate. Additional analysis is undertaken to review and sense check 
the key assumptions underpinning the forecasts.

Cash flow and liquidity reviews
The business planning process provides outputs for detailed cash 
flow and liquidity reviews, to ensure that the Group maintains adequate 
liquidity throughout the forecast periods. The prime output is a liquidity 
forecast which is prepared and updated at least on a monthly basis, which 
highlights the extent of the Group’s liquidity based on controlled cash 
flows and the headroom under the Group’s undrawn revolving credit 
facility. The key inputs into this forecast are:

 – Free cash flow forecasts with information taken from the business 

planning process;

 – Bond and other debt maturities; and
 – Expectations for shareholder returns, spectrum auctions and 

M&A activity.

The liquidity forecast is reviewed by the Group Chief Financial Officer 
and included in each of the reports to the Board. In addition, the Group 
continues to manage its foreign exchange and interest rate risks within 
the framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by 
the Board, with oversight provided by the Treasury Risk Committee.

The Directors have also considered sensitivities in respect of potential 
downside scenarios in concluding that the Group is able to continue 
in operation for the period to 30 June 2024 from the date of approving 
the consolidated financial statements. Those sensitivities include the 
non-refinancing, with the exception of hybrid bonds, of debt maturities 
in the assessment period. A reverse stress test was also reviewed to 
understand how severe conditions would have to be to breach liquidity 
including the required reduction in Adjusted EBITDAaL. The Directors also 
considered the availability of the Group’s €7.7 billion undrawn revolving 
credit facilities as at 31 March 2023.

In reaching their conclusion on the going concern assessment, 
the Directors also considered the findings of the work performed 
to support the statement on the long-term viability of the Group. 
As noted on page 57, this included key changes to relevant principal 
risks in light of global economic and political uncertainty, sensitivity 
analysis, scenario assessments, and combinations of these, over the 
viability assessment period.

Conclusion
Based on the review, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report and Accounts.

Controls over financial reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting for the Group.

The Group’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies 
and procedures that:

 – Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 

accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets;

 – Are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with UK-adopted IAS, with IFRS as issued 
by the IASB and with the requirements of the Act, and that receipts and 
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorisation 
of management and the Directors of the Company; and

 – Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Group’s assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

During the year covered by this report, there were no changes in the 
Group’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially 
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the effectiveness 
of the internal controls over financial reporting. 

Any internal control framework, no matter how well designed, has 
inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the 
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures, and may not 
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion:

 – Vodafone Group Plc’s consolidated financial statements and Company 
financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 March 2023 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 – the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); 

 – the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and

 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 

requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements of Vodafone Group Plc 
(the ‘Parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 
31 March 2023 which comprise:

Group

Parent company

Consolidated statement of financial 
position as at 31 March 2023

position as at 31 March 2023

Consolidated income statement

Consolidated statement of changes 
in equity for the year then ended

Consolidated statement of cash 
flows for the year then ended

Related notes 1 to 33 to the 
financial statements, including 
a summary of significant 
accounting policies

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and UK 
adopted international accounting standards and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB). The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the Parent company financial statements is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).

Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of the Group and Parent in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 

The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the Parent company and we remain independent 
of the Group and the Parent company in conducting the audit.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ 
use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors’ 
assessment of the Group and Parent company’s ability to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

 – confirming our understanding of the directors’ going concern 

assessment process, including the controls over the review and 
approval of the budget and long-range plan; 

 – assessing the appropriateness of the duration of the going concern 
assessment period to 30 June 2024 and considering the existence 
of any significant events or conditions beyond this period based on our 
procedures on the Group’s long-range plan and knowledge arising 
from other areas of the audit;

 – verifying inputs against board-approved forecasts and debt facility 
terms and reconciling the opening liquidity position to the balance 
sheet at 31 March 2023;

 – reviewing borrowing facilities to confirm both their availability to the 
Group and the forecast debt repayments through the going concern 
assessment period and to validate that there is no financial covenant 
in relation to any of the loan arrangements;

 – testing the assessment, including forecast liquidity, for clerical accuracy;
 – assessing whether assumptions made were reasonable and 

appropriately severe, in light of the Group’s relevant principal risks and 
uncertainties and our own independent assessment of those risks; 
 – evaluating management’s historical forecasting accuracy and the 
consistency of the going concern assessment with information 
obtained from other areas of the audit, such as our audit procedures 
on the long-range plans, which underpin management’s goodwill 
impairment assessments; 

 – evaluating the identified mitigating actions available to respond to 
a severe downside scenario, and whether those actions are feasible 
and within the Group’s control;

 – challenging the appropriateness of management’s ‘reverse stress test’ 
downside scenario, to understand how severe conditions would have 
to be to breach liquidity and whether the reduction in EBITDAaL 
required has no more than a remote possibility of occurring when 
compared to historical financial performance; 

 – performing independent sensitivity analysis on management’s 
assumptions including applying incremental adverse cashflow 
sensitivities. These sensitivities included the impact of certain severe 
but plausible scenarios, evaluated as part of management’s work on 
the Group’s long term viability materialising within the going concern 
assessment period; and

 – assessing the appropriateness of the going concern disclosure 

on page 112.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Vodafone Group Plc (continued)

An overview of the scope of the Company and 
Group audits
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
component within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account 
size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of 
group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other 
factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level 
of work to be performed at each component.

In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the consolidated 
financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the consolidated financial statements, 
of the 314 reporting components of the Group, we selected 19 
components covering entities within Germany, South Africa, Italy, United 
Kingdom, Spain, Turkey, Portugal, Egypt, Luxembourg and corporate 
entities, which represent the principal business units within the Group.

Of the 19 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of 9 components (“full scope components”) which 
were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. 

For 4 components (“specific scope components”), we performed full 
audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we 
considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant 
accounts in the consolidated financial statements either because of the 
size of these accounts or their risk profile. For the remaining 6 
components (“specified procedures components”), we performed certain 
audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we 
considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant 
accounts in the financial statements, either because of the size of these 
accounts or their risk profile. Depending on the component or type of 
procedures, these procedures were undertaken by the primary audit 
team or separate component audit team under the primary audit team’s 
direction. The audit scope of these components may not have included 
testing of all significant accounts of the component, but will have 
contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. 

For the 305 components where we did not perform full audit procedures, 
together these represent 26% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDAaL, and 
none are individually greater than 5% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDAaL. 
For the remaining 295 components which are not full scope, specific 
scope or specified procedures scope, we performed other procedures, 
which may include analytical review at both the Group or individual 
component levels and the use of customised data analytics tools over 
the purchase to pay process, fixed assets balances and leases, to profile 
trends and identify items for further investigation, inquiry of management, 
testing entity level controls, testing group-wide controls and testing 
of journals across the Group, including these remaining components, 
in order to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to 
the consolidated financial statements.

Our key observations 
 – The directors’ assessment forecasts that the Group will maintain 

sufficient liquidity throughout the going concern assessment period. 
This included the scenario of non-refinancing of certain debt maturities 
in the assessment period and also the availability of the Group’s €7.7 
billion revolving credit facilities, undrawn as at 31 March 2023. 
Furthermore, management’s reverse stress test to model the extent 
of the EBITDAaL reduction compared to forecasts required to breach 
liquidity during the going concern assessment period is considered 
by management to have only a remote possibility of occurring when 
compared to historical financial performance. 

 – The controllable mitigating actions available to management to 

increase liquidity over the going concern assessment period were not 
modelled by management, nor the audit team, due to the level of 
headroom in both the directors’ assessment forecasts and the audit 
team’s additional downside sensitivities.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any 
material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually 
or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and Parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period from when 
the financial statements are authorised for issue to 30 June 2024.

In relation to the Group and Parent company’s reporting on how they 
have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement 
in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect 
to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.

Overview of our audit approach
Audit scope

 – We performed an audit of the complete 

financial information of 9 components, full audit 
procedures on specific balances for 4 
components, specified audit procedures on 
specific balances for a further 6 components 
and other procedures on the remaining 295 
components.

 – The components where we performed full audit 
procedures accounted for 74% of Adjusted 
EBITDAaL and where we performed full or 
specified audit procedures in respect of revenue 
accounted for 80% of Revenue.

 – Revenue recognition
 – Carrying value of cash generating units, 

including goodwill

 – Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax 

assets on tax losses – Luxembourg

Key audit matters

Materiality

 – Overall Group materiality of €300m (FY22: 

€290m) has been calculated based on Adjusted 
EBITDAaL as defined in the ‘Our application of 
materiality’ section of this report. This materiality 
represents approximately 2% of the Group’s 
Adjusted EBITDAaL as reported in Note 2 in the 
consolidated financial statements.

procedures by the primary audit team on the entire balance, with support from component audit teams on certain procedures.

6.  The contribution of specified procedures components to Group Adjusted EBITDAaL is included within ‘remaining components’ as audit procedures were performed on certain, but not all, significant 

accounts of the specified procedures components contributing to Group Adjusted EBITDAaL. 
Included within the 314 reporting components are the Group’s joint venture investments in Vodafone Ziggo and INWIT, and Safaricom, an associate, which were subject to other procedures.

8.  Changes in the number of remaining components compared to prior year reflect increases in the number of entities within the Group’s consolidation system.

 * Adjusted EBITDAaL as defined in ‘Our application of materiality’ section of this report. This metric has the same definition as the Group’s Adjusted EBITDAaL. Non-GAAP measures are defined on page 220 

of the Annual Report. 

The primary audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor 
visits key locations on a rotational basis. In the current year the Senior 
Statutory Auditor and other team members visited component teams 
in Germany, UK and South Africa. The Senior Statutory Auditor, also 
remotely attended audit closing meetings with component teams and 
management of all full scope locations. In addition, visits were undertaken 
by members of the primary audit team to the component teams in Spain, 
Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Egypt and VOIS India. These visits involved 
meetings with local management, understanding the overall audit 
approach, including key issues and response as well as reviewing key 
work papers on risk areas. 

The primary audit team interacted regularly with the local EY full 
scope and specified procedures component teams where appropriate 
during various stages of the audit, reviewed relevant working papers 
and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. 
We maintained continuous and open dialogue with the component audit 
teams in addition to holding formal meetings to ensure that we were fully 
aware of their progress and the results of their procedures. Close 
meetings for full, specific, and specified audit procedures components 
(excluding those performed by the primary audit team) were held via 
video conference in April 2023 and were attended by the Senior 
Statutory Auditor and/or other members of the primary audit team. 
This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, 
gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements.

Changes from the prior year 
The approach to audit scoping is similar to the prior year audit, with the 
rotation of a number of markets, designated as specified procedures 
scope for selected significant accounts, to extend the Group audit 
procedures beyond the Group’s main markets and to introduce a level 
of unpredictability through rotational testing. This approach resulted in: 

 – specified procedures scope being assigned to components in Portugal 
and Vodafone Insurance Company which were not subject to direct 
audit procedures in the prior year; and

 – Czech Republic and Hungary being reassessed as remaining 

components in the current year.

Involvement with component audit teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us, as the primary audit team, or by component auditors 
from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. 
Of the 9 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 
2 of these directly by the primary audit team with the remaining 7 being 
performed by component audit teams. For the 4 specific scope 
components, the procedures were performed directly by the primary 
audit team. For the 6 specified procedures scope components, work was 
performed directly by the primary audit team for 3 of these, with the 
remaining 3 being performed by component audit teams. Where the 
work was performed by component auditors, we determined the 
appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient 
audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Vodafone has centralised processes and controls over certain areas within 
its Vodafone Intelligent Solutions (“VOIS”) finance shared service centre 
locations. The primary audit team performs direct oversight, review, 
and coordination of the EY audit teams at VOIS, whose work includes 
centralised testing for certain controls and accounts, including specified 
procedures on leases, fixed assets, intangible assets, cash and centralised 
purchase to pay processes.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Vodafone Group Plc (continued)

Our audit effort in considering climate change was focused on ensuring 
that the effects of material climate risks disclosed on page 59 have been 
appropriately reflected in asset values and associated disclosures where 
values are determined through modelling future cash flows, being 
‘Goodwill’, ‘Other intangible assets’ and ‘Deferred tax assets’, and in 
the timing and nature of liabilities recognised, being ‘Asset Retirement 
Obligations’. The findings from our procedures supported our evaluation 
of the adequacy of climate change considerations in the Directors’ 
assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures. 

Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change 
on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to materially 
impact a key audit matter.

Climate change 
There has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate 
change will impact Vodafone Group Plc. The Group has determined that 
the most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations 
will be from its Planet activities and commitments set out on pages 
35 to 39 and the material climate-related physical and transitional risks 
explained on pages 58 to 59 in the required Task Force for Climate 
related Financial Disclosures, both of which form part of the “Other 
information,” rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures 
on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering 
whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise 
appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities 
on other information.

In planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts 
of climate change on the Group’s business and any consequential 
material impact on its financial statements. 

As explained in Note 1 Basis of Preparation to the consolidated financial 
statements, environmental, regulatory and other factors responsive to 
climate change risks are still developing, and are outside of the Group’s 
control, and consequently financial statements cannot capture all 
possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of 
certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into 
account when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing 
of future cash flows under the requirements of UK adopted International 
Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
The significant accounting estimates and judgements assessed by 
management to be potentially impacted by climate risks have been 
described in Note 1 and with further disclosure in respect of the impact 
on the Group’s long-range plans and deferred tax asset recognition 
provided in Note 4 and Note 6 respectively.

Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change 

on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to materially 

impact a key audit matter.

Climate change 

There has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate 

change will impact Vodafone Group Plc. The Group has determined that 

the most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations 

will be from its Planet activities and commitments set out on pages 

35 to 39 and the material climate-related physical and transitional risks 

explained on pages 58 to 59 in the required Task Force for Climate 

related Financial Disclosures, both of which form part of the “Other

on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering 

whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements 

or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise 

appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities 

on other information.

In planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts 

of climate change on the Group’s business and any consequential 

material impact on its financial statements. 

As explained in Note 1 Basis of Preparation to the consolidated financial 

statements, environmental, regulatory and other factors responsive to 

climate change risks are still developing, and are outside of the Group’s 

control, and consequently financial statements cannot capture all 

possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of 

certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into 

account when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing 

of future cash flows under the requirements of UK adopted International

(IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 

The significant accounting estimates and judgements assessed by 

management to be potentially impacted by climate risks have been 

described in Note 1 and with further disclosure in respect of the impact 

on the Group’s long-range plans and deferred tax asset recognition 

provided in Note 4 and Note 6 respectively.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included 
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.

Risk

Revenue recognition
As more fully described in Note 2, Note 14 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group reported revenue of €45,706 million (FY22: 
€45,580 million), contract assets of €3,557 million (FY22: €3,551 million) and contract liabilities of €2,543 million (FY22: €2,521million) for the year 
ended and as at 31 March 2023. Management records revenue according to the principles of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
including following the 5-step model therein. 

Auditing the revenue recorded by the Group is complex due to the multiple IT systems and tools utilised in the initiation, processing and recording 
of transactions, which includes a high volume of individually low monetary value transactions. Furthermore, judgement and the involvement of IT 
professionals was required to determine the audit approach to test and evaluate the relevant data that was captured and aggregated, and to assess the 
sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained. 

We have also identified a risk of management override through inappropriate manual topside revenue journal entries, given revenue is a key 
performance indicator, both in external communication and for management incentives.

Our response to the risk

We performed full or specified audit procedures over this risk area in 7 full scope and 3 specified procedure components with significant revenue 
streams, which covered 80% of the Group’s revenue. 

Our audit procedures at full scope component locations included, among others obtaining an understanding of, evaluating the design and testing the 
operating effectiveness of controls over the Group’s revenue recognition process, which includes management’s review of contracts, their identification 
of performance obligations, the estimation of the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation, and the determination of the timing 
of revenue recorded. With the support of our IT professionals, we also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the 
appropriate flow of transactional data through the IT systems and tools and the reconciliation of the transactional data to the accounting records. 
For specified procedures components, we obtained an understanding of the design of controls over the revenue recognition process. 

We evaluated management’s accounting policies and the methodology used by management to determine the standalone selling price, where 
relevant to the requirements of IFRS 15.

For significant revenue streams, our audit procedures included the following, on a sample basis:

 – Where new material customer propositions were introduced during the period, we evaluated management’s assessment of the accounting 

treatment for the new propositions for compliance with IFRS 15. 

 – Where practicable, at certain components we extended the use of data analytics in the current year. Our procedures involved testing full populations 

of transactions, including performing a correlation analysis between invoiced revenue, receivables and cash. We performed targeted audit 
procedures over all material items that did not correlate as expected.

 – At components where data analytics was not practicable, for each significant revenue IT system, we obtained the billing data to general ledger 

reconciliation which included the relevant adjustments to deferred and accrued revenue balances. We reperformed these end-to-end 
reconciliations, including assessing the accuracy of the data inputs to underlying source documentation including contractual agreements where 
applicable. In addition, we tested the mathematical accuracy and completeness of the reconciliations and any material reconciling items including 
significant revenue postings outside of the billing systems. 

 – We recalculated the revenue recognised to evaluate whether the processing of the revenue recognition by the Group’s IT systems was 

materially correct.

 – We assessed the standalone selling price (‘SSP’) allocated to individual elements of bundled contracts by, where applicable and among other 
procedures, comparing to observable market pricing, recalculating the estimated SSP and testing its application to performance obligations.
 – We used data analytic tools to identify revenue related manual journals posted to the general ledger and traced these back to source systems or 
other corroborative evidence. This included analytical procedures to consider the completeness of journal postings. We obtained and evaluated 
underlying source documentation to test the completeness and accuracy of the postings, including those journals we considered unusual in nature. 

We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect to the accounting policies on revenue recognition.

Key observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee

Based on the procedures performed, including those in respect of manual adjustments to revenue, we did not identify any evidence of material 
misstatement in the revenue recognised in the year ended 31 March 2023.

Risk

Carrying value of cash generating units, including goodwill 
As more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group calculates the 
value in use (‘VIU’) for cash generating units (‘CGUs’) to determine whether an adjustment to the carrying value of the CGU, and therefore, goodwill, 
is required. As at 31 March 2023, the Group has recorded €27,615 million (FY22: €31,884 million) of goodwill, primarily in respect of Germany and Italy. 

The Group’s assessment of the VIU of its CGUs involves estimation about the future performance of the local market businesses. In particular, the 
determination of the VIUs for Germany, UK, Italy and Spain was sensitive to the significant assumptions of projected adjusted EBITDAaL growth, 
long-term growth rates, and discount rates. 

Auditing the Group’s annual impairment test for these selected CGUs was complex and involved significant auditor judgement, given the estimation 
uncertainty related to the significant assumptions described above, used in the VIU models and the sensitivity of certain VIU models to fluctuations 
in those assumptions, including where those CGUs had historical impairments, market specific events or other factors which resulted in low headroom. 

Our response to the risk

The recoverability of the Group’s goodwill balances was subject to full scope audit procedures performed by the primary audit team with support from 
relevant component audit teams on certain procedures for certain local market businesses.

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Group’s goodwill impairment review 
process, including management’s controls over the significant assumptions described above. 

For the annual impairment assessment as at 31 March 2023, we also assessed, with the help of a valuation specialist, the methodology applied in the 
VIU models, as compared to the requirements of IAS 36, including the mathematical accuracy of management’s model. We performed procedures to 
assess the significant assumptions used in the VIU models, including:

 – evaluating projected adjusted EBITDAaL growth, for example by comparing underlying assumptions to external data, such as economic and industry 

forecasts for the relevant markets and for consistency with evidence obtained from other areas of our audit;

 – comparing the cash flow projections used in the VIU models to the information approved by the Group’s Board of Directors and evaluated the 
historical accuracy of management’s business plans, which underpin the VIU models, by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results in the 
current period; 

 – comparing long-term growth rates and discount rates to EY independently determined acceptable ranges;
 – performing sensitivity analyses on the above described assumptions in the VIU models to evaluate the parameters that, should they arise, would 

cause an impairment of the CGU or indicate additional disclosures were appropriate; and

 – in considering the existence of contrary evidence, for management’s assessment of implied recoverable value, we compared CGU EBITDAaL 

multiples to market listed peers and considered independent analyst valuations for individual CGUs, where available. 

We also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures provided in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, in particular the sensitivity 
disclosures in relation to reasonably possible changes in assumptions that could result in impairment.

Key observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee

We agree with management’s conclusion that no impairment charge is required to be recognised in the year in respect of its operating company CGUs.

The sensitivity disclosures included in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements reflect those changes in certain key assumptions that would 
eliminate the headroom of those CGUs. The additional sensitivity disclosures for both the Spain and Italy GCUs, of reasonable possible changes in the 
key assumptions of discount rate and Adjusted EBITDAaL growth, and which could lead to a different conclusion in respect of the recoverability 
of carrying value of these CGUs, reflect the limited headroom in those CGUs.

Risk

Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses – Luxembourg
As more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recognises deferred tax assets in accordance with IAS 12 Income 
Taxes, based on their estimated recoverability and whether management judges that it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable 
profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future.

A deferred tax asset in Luxembourg of €16,269 million (FY22: €16,298 million) has been recognised in respect of losses, as management concluded it 
is probable that the Luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which they can utilise these assets. Management 
estimates that the losses will be utilised over a period of 35 to 39 years (FY22: 45 to 48 years). 

The Luxembourg companies’ income is derived from the Group’s internal financing, procurement and roaming activities. The forecast future finance 
income can vary based on forecast interest rates and intercompany debt levels which in turn impacts the timeframe over which the deferred tax asset 
is forecast to be recovered. 

Furthermore, during the course of the year Luxembourg owned direct and indirect interests in the Group’s operating activities. The value of these 
investments were primarily based on the Group’s most recent value in use calculations. Changes in the value for the purposes of local Luxembourg 
statutory financial statements can result in impairment reversals or impairments which are taxable / tax deductible under local law. In December 2022, 
the Group completed an internal restructure to simplify the ownership structure of various operating companies and the operations of certain legal 
entities. The restructure has no impact on the Group’s internal financing, procurement and roaming activities but the losses in Luxembourg, and their 
recovery timeframe, will no longer be impacted by the changes in the valuation of the Group’s operating companies. 

Auditing the Group’s recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets in Luxembourg is significant to the audit because it involves material amounts, 
and the judgements and estimates in relation to future taxable profits and the period of time over which it is expected to utilise these assets, results 
in increased estimation uncertainty. 

Our response to the risk

Audit procedures on the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses in Luxembourg were performed by the primary audit team 
and its tax professionals, with support from Luxembourg tax and transfer pricing specialists on certain procedures.

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management’s controls around the recognition 
of deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, including the calculation of the gross amount of deferred tax assets recorded, the preparation of the prospective 
financial information used to determine the Luxembourg entities’ future taxable income, and management’s identification and use of available 
commercial strategies.

To test the realisability of the deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, with the support of tax professionals and tax specialists, our audit procedures included, 
among others; 

We also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures provided in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, in particular the sensitivity 

 – assessing the existence of available losses and evaluating management’s position on the recoverability of the losses with respect to local tax law 

disclosures in relation to reasonably possible changes in assumptions that could result in impairment.

and tax planning strategies adopted:

 – testing the calculation and assessing the reasonableness of the valuation of entities within the Luxembourg structure to recent financial information 
including where appropriate, cashflow projections applied in the most recent value in use calculations, net asset valuations and share price data, and 
corroborating the Luxembourg ownership structure both at the date of the internal restructure in December 2022 and at the balance sheet date; 

 – assessing the forecasted procurement and roaming taxable profits utilised in management’s realisability assessment, by comparing them to 

historical actual profits and with evidence obtained from other areas of our audit;

 – evaluating the forecast finance income by, on a sample basis, recalculating income with reference to underlying agreements, comparing future 
interest rates utilised in the forecasts to relevant external benchmarks and the assumed reductions in intergroup debt for consistency with our 
understanding of relevant guidance in respect of transfer pricing of financial transactions;

 – assessing whether contrary evidence exists that is not consistent with either management’s stated intention that the financing structures will remain 

in place or that it is probable that future taxable profits will exist; and

 – evaluating the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of the recognition of the deferred tax asset, including as it relates to the evidence supporting 
the recognition, judgements in respect of the utilisation profile including longer term uncertainties and the key drivers of changes in the carrying 
value of the asset and the utilisation period. 

Key observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee

We agree with the recognition of the deferred tax assets, and consequently the long recoverability period, on the basis of forecast profits which are 
considered probable given management’s intention to retain current activities in Luxembourg over the long term and the track record of historical 
profitability in these operations.

The reduction in the period of utilisation in FY23 is consistent with market condition of higher interest rates, driving increased forecast taxable profits 
on existing financing activities.

Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual 
Report set out on pages 1 to 109, other than the financial statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other 
information contained within the Annual Report. 

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such 
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement 
in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the 
other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

 – the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and 

 – the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared 

in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the 
Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or 
the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:

 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or

 – the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 

Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or

 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 

not made; or

 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require 

for our audit.

Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, 
in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in 
forming our audit opinion. 

Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in 
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides 
a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.

We determined materiality for the Group to be €300 million (2022: €290 
million), which is approximately 2% (2022: approximately 2%) of Adjusted 
EBITDAaL. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAaL provides us with the most 
relevant performance measure on which to determine materiality, given 
the prominence of this metric throughout the Annual Report and 
consolidated financial statements, investor presentations, profit metrics 
focussed on by analysts and its alignment to the management 
remuneration metric of adjusted EBIT. Consistent with the prior year, 
at the planning stage of the audit, the materiality basis included the add 
back of budgeted restructuring costs which were considered to be 
recurring in both nature and value for the Group’s operations.

In November 2022 the Group announced a new costs savings target of 
in excess of €1 billion focused on streamlining and further simplifying the 
Group. In response a number of restructuring programmes were initiated 
across certain of the Group’s markets and functions, resulting in greater 
restructuring activity and expense in the year. On the basis that the most 
significant expense relate to these discrete restructuring plans, we 
excluded these from the final materiality basis, which aligns with the 
Group’s definitions of Adjusted EBITDAaL as defined on page 220 
of the Annual Report. 

We determined materiality for the Company to be €502 million (2022: 
€467 million), which is 1% (2022: 1%) of the Company’s equity. However, 
since the Company was a full scope component, for accounts that were 
relevant for the Group financial statements, a performance materiality of 
€45 million was applied.

Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. 
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements 
exceeds materiality.

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s overall control environment to prevent or 
detect and correct material errors, our judgement was that performance 
materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely 
€225m (2022: €218m).

Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit 
coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk 
of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk 
of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of 
performance materiality allocated to components was €45m to €225m 
(2022: €42m to €218m). 

Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as 
being clearly trivial.

We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to 
them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of €15m (2022: €15m), 
which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that 
threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, 

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual 

in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in

forming our audit opinion. 

Materiality

our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other 

information contained within the Annual Report. 

The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in 

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other

information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 

decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides 

report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 

We determined materiality for the Group to be €300 million (2022: €290 

consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 

million), which is approximately 2% (2022: approximately 2%) of Adjusted 

financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit 

EBITDAaL. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAaL provides us with the most 

or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such 

relevant performance measure on which to determine materiality, given 

material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 

the prominence of this metric throughout the Annual Report and 

required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement 

consolidated financial statements, investor presentations, profit metrics 

in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have 

focussed on by analysts and its alignment to the management 

performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the 

remuneration metric of adjusted EBIT. Consistent with the prior year, 

other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the 

Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited 

has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

 – the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report 

for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 

is consistent with the financial statements; and 

 – the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared 

in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report 

by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the 

Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 

have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or 

the directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 

relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 

in our opinion:

 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or 

returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 

not visited by us; or

 – the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 

Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 

accounting records and returns; or

 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 

not made; or

for our audit.

at the planning stage of the audit, the materiality basis included the add 

back of budgeted restructuring costs which were considered to be 

recurring in both nature and value for the Group’s operations.

In November 2022 the Group announced a new costs savings target of 

in excess of €1 billion focused on streamlining and further simplifying the 

Group. In response a number of restructuring programmes were initiated 

across certain of the Group’s markets and functions, resulting in greater 

restructuring activity and expense in the year. On the basis that the most 

significant expense relate to these discrete restructuring plans, we 

excluded these from the final materiality basis, which aligns with the 

Group’s definitions of Adjusted EBITDAaL as defined on page 220 

of the Annual Report. 

We determined materiality for the Company to be €502 million (2022: 

€467 million), which is 1% (2022: 1%) of the Company’s equity. However, 

since the Company was a full scope component, for accounts that were 

relevant for the Group financial statements, a performance materiality of 

€45 million was applied.

Performance materiality

The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. 

It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 

that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements 

exceeds materiality.

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the 

effectiveness of the Group’s overall control environment to prevent or 

detect and correct material errors, our judgement was that performance 

materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely 

€225m (2022: €218m).

Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit 

coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 

based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance 

materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk 

of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of 

performance materiality allocated to components was €45m to €225m 

(2022: €42m to €218m). 

Reporting threshold

being clearly trivial.

An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as 

We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to 

them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of €15m (2022: €15m), 

which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that 

threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 

quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 

relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk 

 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require 

Corporate Governance Statement
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, 
longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the Group and Company’s compliance with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review 
by the Listing Rules.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded 
that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance 
Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained during the audit:

 – Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting 
the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties 
identified set out on page 112;

 – Directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the Company’s prospects, 
the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate 
set out on page 57;

 – Director’s statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities 
set out on page 112;

 – Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out 

on page 111;

 – Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the 

emerging and principal risks set out on page 111;

 – The section of the annual report that describes the review of 

effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out 
on pages 81 and 108; and;

 – The section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee set 

out on pages 77 to 82. 

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out 
on pages 111 and 112, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable 
of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, 
outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk 
of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate 
concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, 
or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable 
of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection 
of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company 
and management. 

 – We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks 

that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most 
significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 
101, the UK Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance 
Code), the relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates and the EU General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR).

 – We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks 

by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible 
for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. 
We supplemented our enquiries through our review of board minutes 
and papers provided to the Audit and Risk Committee, correspondence 
received from regulatory bodies and attendance at all meetings of the 
Audit and Risk Committee, as well as consideration of the results of our 
audit procedures across the Group.

 – We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to 
material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting 
with management from various parts of the business including 
management and finance teams of the local markets designated as 
full, specific and specified procedures scope locations, Head Office, 
the Audit and Risk Committee, the Group Internal Audit function, the 
Group Legal function and individuals in the fraud and compliance 
department to understand where it considered there was susceptibility 
to fraud; and assessing whistleblowing logs and associated incidences 
for those with a potential financial reporting impact. We also 
considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on 
efforts made by management to manage earnings or influence the 
perceptions of analysts. We considered the programmes and controls 
that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that 
otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud, and how senior 
management monitors those programmes and controls.

 – Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to 
identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations, including 
where necessary using our forensic specialists. Our procedures 
involved enquiries of management at Head Office, the Audit and Risk 
Committee, the Group Internal Audit function, the Group Legal 
function, the Group Corporate Security team, individuals in the fraud 
and compliance department (including those responsible for fraud 
investigation and whistleblowing). We also perform journal entry 
testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals, journals 
indicating large or unusual transactions and journals with key words 
that could indicate management override, based on our understanding 
of the business; and challenging the assumptions and judgements 
made by management in respect of significant one-off transactions 
in the financial year and significant accounting estimates as referred to 
in the key audit matters section above. At a component level, our full 
and specified procedure scope component audit teams’ procedures 
included enquiries of component management; journal entry testing; 
and focussed testing, including in respect of the key audit matter of 
revenue recognition. We also leveraged our data analytics capabilities 
in performing work on the purchase to pay process and fixed asset 
balances and leases, to assist in identifying higher risk transactions 
and balances, respectively, for testing.

 – Where the risk was considered to be higher, including areas impacting 
Group key performance indicators or management remuneration, 
we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk or 
other risk of material misstatement. These procedures included those 
on revenue recognition referred to in the key audit matter section 
above and testing manual journals and were designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from 
material fraud or error.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditor’s report.

Other matters we are required to address 
 – Following the recommendation from the Audit and Risk Committee, 
we were appointed by the Company on 23 July 2019 to audit the 
financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2020 and 
subsequent financial periods. 

The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointments is four years, covering the years ending 
31 March 2020 to 31 March 2023.

 – The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit 

and Risk Committee.

Includes share premium, capital reserve, capital redemption reserve, merger reserve and share-based payment reserve. The merger reserve was derived from acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2004 and subsequently 
allocated to additional paid-in capital on adoption of IFRS. 

3  The currency reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the assets and liabilities of foreign operations. The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the 

foreign operation. 

4  The revaluation surplus derives from acquisitions of subsidiaries made before the Group’s adoption of IFRS 3 (Revised) on 1 April 2010 and comprises the amounts arising from recognising the Group’s pre-existing equity 

interest in the acquired subsidiary at fair value. 

5  Principally includes the impact of the Group’s cash flow hedges with €2,322 million net gain deferred to other comprehensive income during the year (2022: €3,704 million net gain; 2021: €5,892 million net loss) and €896 
million net gain (2022: €1,422 million net gain; 2021: €1,226 million net loss) recycled to the income statement. These hedges primarily relate to foreign exchange exposure on fixed borrowings, with any foreign exchange 
on nominal balances directly impacting income statement in each period but interest cash flows unwinding to the income statement over the life of the hedges (up to 2063). See note 22 ‘Capital and financial risk 
management’ for further details. 

6  The results for the years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 have been re-presented to reflect that Indus Towers Limited is no longer presented as held for sale. As at 31 March 2022, accumulated losses decreased by 

€96 million, resulting in an increase of €96 million in total equity compared to amounts previously reported. As at 31 March 2021, accumulated losses decreased by €53 million, offset by an increase of €5 million in 
accumulated other comprehensive income, resulting in a net decrease of €48 million in total equity compared to amounts previously reported. See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’.  

7  Movements include the re-issue of 1,427 million shares (€1,944 million) in March 2021 to satisfy the first tranche and the re-issue of 1,519 million shares (€1,903 million) in March 2022 to satisfy the second tranche of the 

Mandatory Convertible Bond issued in March 2019.  

8  Principally relates to transactions in relation to Vantage Towers A.G. See note 27 ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ for details.  
9  Represents the irrevocable and non-discretionary share buyback programmes announced on 19 March 2021, 19 May 2021, 23 July 2021, 17 November 2021, 9 March 2022 and 16 November 2022. 
10  Includes a gain on disposal of Vantage Towers A.G. of €8,607 million and a gain on disposal of Vodafone Ghana of €689 million, offset by a loss on disposal of Vodafone Hungary of €69 million.

1. Basis of preparation  

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 

This section describes the critical accounting judgements and estimates that management has identified as having a 
potentially material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements and sets out our significant accounting 
policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a 
specific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note. We have also detailed below the new 
accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our current view of the impact they will have on our 
financial reporting. 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (‘IAS’), with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’). The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis (see page 112).    

Vodafone Group Plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales (registration number 1833679). The registered address of the Company is 
Vodafone House, The Connection, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 2FN, England. 

IFRS requires the Directors to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group’s circumstances. These have been applied 
consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. In determining and applying accounting policies, Directors and management are 
required to make judgements and estimates in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting judgement, estimate or assumption 
to be followed could materially affect the Group’s reported financial position, results or cash flows and disclosure of contingent assets or liabilities 
during the reporting period; it may later be determined that a different choice may have been more appropriate. 

The Group’s critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty are detailed below. Actual outcomes could differ from those 
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if 
the revision affects both current and future periods. 

Management regularly reviews, and revises as necessary, the accounting judgements that significantly impact the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements and the estimates that are considered to be ‘critical estimates’ due to their potential to give rise to material adjustments in the 
Group’s financial statements in the year to 31 March 2024. As at 31 March 2023, management has identified critical judgements in respect of 
revenue recognition, lease accounting, valuing assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, the accounting for tax disputes, the 
classification of joint arrangements, whether to recognise provisions or to disclose contingent liabilities, held for sale accounting and the impacts of 
climate change. In addition, management has identified critical accounting estimates in relation to the recovery of deferred tax assets, post 
employment benefits and impairment reviews; estimates have also been identified that are not considered to be critical in respect of the allocation 
of revenue to goods and services, the useful economic lives of finite lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. 

The majority of the Group’s provisions are either long-term in nature (such as asset retirement obligations) or relate to shorter-term liabilities (such 
as those relating to restructuring and property) where there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year. 
Critical judgements exercised in respect of tax disputes include cases in India and a tax dispute related to financing costs in the Netherlands.  

These critical accounting judgements, estimates and related disclosures have been discussed with the Group’s Audit and Risk Committee.  

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty  
Revenue recognition  
Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data and the use of management 
judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant accounting judgements and source of estimation uncertainty are 
disclosed below.  

Gross versus net presentation 
If the Group has control of goods or services when they are delivered to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer; 
otherwise the Group is acting as an agent. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by 
management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the 
amount of reported revenue and operating expenses (see note 2 ‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’) but do not impact reported 
assets, liabilities or cash flows. Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or an agent include, for example, those 
where the Group delivers third-party branded software or services (such as premium music, TV content or cloud-based services) to customers and 
goods or those where services delivered to customers in partnership with a third-party.

1. Basis of preparation (continued)  

Allocation of revenue to goods and services provided to customers 
Revenue is recognised when goods and services are delivered to customers (see note 2 ‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’). Goods and 
services may be delivered to a customer at different times under the same contract, hence it is necessary to allocate the amount payable by the 
customer between goods and services on a ‘relative standalone selling price basis’; this requires the identification of performance obligations 
(‘obligations’) and the determination of standalone selling prices for the identified obligations. The determination of obligations is, for the primary goods 
and services sold by the Group, not considered to be a critical accounting judgement; the Group’s policy on identifying obligations is disclosed in note 2 
‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’. The determination of standalone selling prices for identified obligations is discussed below.  

It is necessary to estimate the standalone price when the Group does not sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a standalone 
basis. When estimating the standalone price the Group maximises the use of external inputs; methods for estimating standalone prices include 
determining the standalone price of similar goods and services sold by the Group, observing the standalone prices for similar goods and services when 
sold by third parties or using a cost-plus reasonable margin approach (which is sometimes the case for devices and other equipment). Where it is not 
possible to reliably estimate standalone prices due to a lack of observable standalone sales or highly variable pricing, which is sometimes the case for 
services, the standalone price of an obligation may be determined as the transaction price less the standalone prices of other obligations in the contract. 
The standalone price determined for obligations materially impacts the allocation of revenue between obligations and impacts the timing of revenue 
when obligations are provided to customers at different times – for example, the allocation of revenue between devices, which are usually delivered up-
front, and services which are typically delivered over the contract period. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment 
to the carrying value of contract-related assets or liabilities in the 12 months after the balance sheet date if these estimates were revised. 

Lease accounting 
Lease accounting under IFRS 16 is complex and necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data and the increased use of 
management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant accounting judgements are disclosed below.  

Lease identification 
Whether the arrangement is considered a lease or a service contract depends on the analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of 
the arrangement between the Group and the counter-party to determine if control of an identified asset has been passed between the parties; if not, the 
arrangement is a service arrangement. Control exists if the Group obtains substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the asset, and has the 
ability to direct its use, for a period of time. An identified asset exists where an agreement explicitly or implicitly identifies an asset or a physically distinct 
portion of an asset which the lessor has no substantive right to substitute. 

The scenarios requiring the greatest judgement include those where the arrangement is for the use of fibre or other fixed telecommunication lines. 
Generally, where the Group has exclusive use of a physical line it is determined that the Group can also direct the use of the line and therefore leases will 
be recognised. Where the Group provides access to fibre or other fixed telecommunication lines to another operator on a wholesale basis the 
arrangement will generally be identified as a lease, whereas when the Group provides fixed line services to an end-user, generally control over such lines 
is not passed to the end-user and a lease is not identified. 

The impact of determining whether an agreement is a lease or a service depends on whether the Group is a potential lessee or lessor in the arrangement 
and, where the Group is a lessor, whether the arrangement is classified as an operating or finance lease. The impacts for each scenario are described 
below where the Group is potentially: 
- 

A lessee. The judgement impacts the nature and timing of both costs and reported assets and liabilities. A lease results in an asset and a liability being 
reported and depreciation and interest being recognised; the interest charge will decrease over the life of the lease. A service contract results in 
operating expenses being recognised evenly over the life of the contract and no assets or liabilities being recorded (other than trade payables, 
prepayments and accruals). 
An operating lessor. The judgement impacts the nature of income recognised. An operating lease results in lease income being recognised whilst a 
service contract results in service revenue. Both are recognised evenly over the life of the contract. 
A finance lessor. The judgement impacts the nature and timing of both income and reported assets. A finance lease results in the lease income being 
recognised at commencement of the lease and an asset (the net investment in the lease) being recorded. 

- 

- 

Lease term 
Where leases include additional optional periods after an initial lease term, significant judgement is required in determining whether these optional 
periods should be included when determining the lease term. The impact of this judgement is significantly greater where the Group is a lessee. As a 
lessee, optional periods are included in the lease term if the Group is reasonably certain it will exercise an extension option or will not exercise a 
termination option; this depends on an analysis by management of all relevant facts and circumstances including the leased asset’s nature and purpose, 
the economic and practical potential for replacing the asset and any plans that the Group has in place for the future use of the asset. Where a leased 
asset is highly customised (either when initially provided or as a result of leasehold improvements) or it is impractical or uneconomic to replace then the 
Group is more likely to judge that lease extension options are reasonably certain to be exercised. The value of the right-of-use asset and lease liability will 
be greater when extension options are included in the lease term. The normal approach adopted for lease term by asset class is described below.

The lease terms can vary significantly by type and use of asset and geography. In addition, the exact lease term is subject to the non-cancellable period 
and rights and options in each contract. Generally, lease terms are judged to be the longer of the minimum lease term and: 
- 

Between 5 and 10 years for land and buildings (excluding retail), with terms at the top end of this range if the lease relates to assets that are considered 
to be difficult to exit sooner for economic, practical or reputational reasons; 
To the next contractual lease break date for retail premises (excluding breaks within the next 12 months); 
Where leases are used to provide internal connectivity the lease term for the connectivity is aligned to the lease term or useful economic life of the 
assets connected;  
The customer service agreement length for leases of local loop connections or other assets required to provide fixed line services to individual 
customers; and 
Where there are contractual agreements to provide services using leased assets, the lease term for these assets is generally set in accordance with the 
above principles or for the lease term required to provide the services for the agreed service period, if longer.  

- 
- 

- 

- 

In most instances the Group has options to renew or extend leases for additional periods after the end of the lease term which are assessed using the 
criteria above. 

Lease terms are reassessed if a significant event or change in circumstances occurs relating to the leased assets that is within the control of the Group; 
such changes usually relate to commercial agreements entered into by the Group, or business decisions made by the Group.  Where such changes 
change the Group’s assessment of whether it is reasonably certain to exercise options to extend, or not terminate leases, then the lease term is 
reassessed and the lease liability is remeasured, which in most cases will increase the lease liability.  

Taxation 
The Group’s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge 
involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters, being principally: 

Recognition of deferred tax assets 
Significant items on which the Group has exercised accounting estimation and judgement include the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect 
of losses in Luxembourg, Germany, Italy and Spain as well as capital allowances in the United Kingdom. The recognition of deferred tax assets, 
particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether management judge that it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable 
profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future. The Group assesses the availability of future taxable 
profits using the same undiscounted five year forecasts for the Group’s operations as are used in the Group’s value in use calculations (see note 4 
‘Impairment losses’). In the case of Luxembourg, this includes forecasts of future income from the Group’s internal financing, centralised 
procurement and roaming activities.  

Where tax losses are forecast to be recovered beyond the five year period, the availability of taxable profits is assessed using the cash flows and long-
term growth rates used for the value in use calculations. 

The estimated cash flows inherent in these forecasts include the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business including the 
potential impacts of changes in the market structure, trends in customer pricing, the costs associated with the acquisition and retention of 
customers, future technological evolutions and potential regulatory changes, such as our ability to acquire and/or renew spectrum licences. 

Changes in the estimates which underpin the Group’s forecasts could have an impact on the amount of future taxable profits and could have a 
significant impact on the period over which the deferred tax asset would be recovered. 

The Group only considers substantively enacted tax laws when assessing the amount and availability of tax losses to offset against the future taxable 
profits. See note 6 ‘Taxation’ to the consolidated financial statements. 

See additional commentary relating to climate change below.    

Uncertain tax positions 
The tax impact of a transaction or item can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process. The 
Group uses in-house tax experts when assessing uncertain tax positions and seeks the advice of external professional advisors where appropriate. 
The most significant judgements in this area relate to the Group’s tax disputes in India and a tax dispute related to financing costs in the Netherlands. 
Further details of tax disputes are included in note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ to the consolidated financial statements. 

Business combinations and goodwill 
When the Group completes a business combination, the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, are 
recognised. The determination of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management’s judgement. If the 
purchase consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired then the incremental amount paid is recognised as goodwill. If the purchase 
price consideration is lower than the fair value of the assets acquired then the difference is recorded as a gain in the income statement.  

Allocation of the purchase price between finite lived assets (discussed below) and indefinite lived assets such as goodwill affects the subsequent results 
of the Group as finite lived intangible assets are amortised, whereas indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortised.  

See note 27 ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 

1. Basis of preparation (continued)  

Joint arrangements 
The Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with one or more other parties. Judgement is 
required to classify joint arrangements in a separate legal entity as either a joint operation or as a joint venture, which depends on management’s 
assessment of the legal form and substance of the arrangement taking into account relevant facts and circumstances such as whether the owners have 
rights to substantially all the economic outputs and, in substance, settle the liabilities of the entity. 

The classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group’s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and 
cash flows of joint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis, whereas the Group’s investment and share of 
results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated income statement 
respectively. See note 12 ‘Investments in associates and joint arrangements’ to the consolidated financial statements. 

Finite lived intangible assets 
Other intangible assets include amounts spent by the Group acquiring licences and spectrum, customer bases and the costs of purchasing and 
developing computer software. 

Where intangible assets are acquired through business combinations and no active market for the assets exists, the fair value of these assets is 
determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset. Estimates relating to the future cash flows and discount rates used 
may have a material effect on the reported amounts of finite lived intangible assets. 

Estimation of useful life 
The useful life over which intangible assets are amortised depends on management’s estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived 
from the asset. Useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate. Management’s estimates of useful life have a material 
impact on the amount of amortisation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying 
values of intangible assets in the year to 31 March 2024 if these estimates were revised. The basis for determining the useful life for the most significant 
categories of intangible assets are discussed below.  

Customer bases 
The estimated useful life principally reflects management’s view of the average economic life of the customer base and is assessed by reference to 
customer churn rates. An increase in churn rates may lead to a reduction in the estimated useful life and an increase in the amortisation charge. 

Capitalised software  
For computer software, the estimated useful life is based on management’s view, considering historical experience with similar products as well as 
anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes in technology. The useful life will not exceed the duration of a licence. 

Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment represents 24.4% of the Group’s total assets (2022: 26.5%). Estimates and assumptions made may have a material impact 
on their carrying value and related depreciation charge. See note 11 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ to the consolidated financial statements for further 
details. 

Estimation of useful life 
The depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its expected useful life and expected residual value, which are reviewed annually. 
Management’s estimates of useful life have a material impact on the amount of depreciation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a 
significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying values of property, plant and equipment in the year to 31 March 2024 if these estimates were 
revised.  

Management determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking into 
account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology.  

See additional commentary relating to climate change, below.  

Post employment benefits 
Management uses estimates when determining the Group’s liabilities and expenses arising for defined benefit pension schemes. Management is 
required to estimate the future rates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have a material impact on 
the defined benefit obligations that are recorded. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 25 ‘Post employment benefits’ to 
the consolidated financial statements. 

Contingent liabilities 
The Group exercises judgement to determine whether to recognise provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigations or 
other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities (see 
note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ to the consolidated financial statements). Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood that a 
pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise.  

Impairment reviews 
IFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets, and for finite lived assets and for equity accounted 
investments if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  

Management is required to make significant judgments concerning the identification of impairment indicators, the determination of fair values for assets 
and whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows that they are expected to generate.

Other information

The Group performs an annual impairment test which focuses on determining a recoverable amount for its assets based on value in use, rather than 
fair value less costs of disposal due to a lack of observable market data on fair values for equivalent assets.  

Calculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including 
management’s expectations of: 
− 

Growth in adjusted EBITDAaL, (see note 2 ‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’ for a reconciliation to the consolidated income 
statement); 

− 
− 
− 

Timing and amount of future capital expenditure, licence and spectrum payments; 

Long-term growth rates; and  

Appropriate discount rates to reflect the risks involved. 

Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular projected adjusted EBITDAaL, long-term growth rate and discount rate 
assumptions, could significantly affect the Group’s impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profits or losses. Further details, including 
a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 4 ‘Impairment losses’ to the consolidated financial statements. 

Where the Group has interests in listed entities, market data, such as share price, is used to assess the fair value of those interests. If the market 
capitalisation indicates that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, possible adjustments to the share price are reviewed and, where 
information is available, a value in use calculation is performed to support a conclusion on impairment. 

For operations that are classified as held for sale, management is required to determine whether the carrying value of the discontinued operation 
can be supported by the fair value less costs of disposal. Where not observable in a quoted market, management has determined fair value less 
costs to sell by reference to the outcomes from the application of a number of potential valuation techniques, determined from inputs other than 
quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  

For a number of reasons, transaction values agreed as part of any business acquisition or disposal may be higher than the assessed value in use. 

See additional commentary relating to climate change, below.  

Held for sale accounting 
When the value of a non-current asset or a group of assets in a disposal group will be primarily recovered through a sale transaction and there is an 
active plan for the disposal such that it is highly probable that the disposal will be completed within 12 months (subject to certain matters outside of 
the Group’s control) then the related assets will be classified as held for sale or as a discontinued operation.    

Judgement is applied by management in determining if assets meet the requirements to be classified as held for sale or as discontinued operations.  
Further detail is provided in note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’. 

Climate change 
The potential climate change-related risks and opportunities to which the Group is exposed, as identified by management, are disclosed in the 
Group’s TCFD disclosures on pages 58 and 59. Management has assessed the potential financial impacts relating to the identified risks, primarily 
considering the useful lives of, and retirement obligations for, property, plant and equipment, the possibility of impairment of goodwill and other 
long-lived assets and the recoverability of the Group’s deferred tax assets. Management has exercised judgement in concluding that there are no 
further material financial impacts of the Group’s climate-related risks and opportunities on the consolidated financial statements. These 
judgements will be kept under review by management as the future impacts of climate change depend on environmental, regulatory and other 
factors outside of the Group’s control which are not all currently known.    

Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as a 
whole 
Accounting convention 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain financial and equity instruments that have been 
measured at fair value and for the application of IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’ for the Group’s entities reporting in 
Turkish lira (see below).  

Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, subsidiaries controlled by the Company (see note 31 
‘Related undertakings’ to the consolidated financial statements), joint operations that are subject to joint control and the results of joint ventures 
and associates (see note 12 ‘Investments in associates and joint arrangements’ to the consolidated financial statements). 

Basis of preparation changes adopted on 1 April 2022 - Hyperinflation 
As anticipated in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2022, Turkey met the requirements to be designated as a hyperinflationary 
economy under IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’ in the quarter ended 30 June 2022. In addition, Ethiopia where the 
Group’s associate, Safaricom, has operations has also become a hyperinflationary economy in the year. The Group has therefore applied 
hyperinflationary accounting, as specified in IAS 29, at its Turkish operations whose functional currency is the Turkish lira and to Safaricom’s 
operations in Ethiopia where the Ethiopian birr is the functional currency for the reporting period commencing 1 April 2022. This resulted in an 
opening balance adjustment of €565 million to consolidated equity.  

In accordance with IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’, comparative amounts have not been restated.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 

1. Basis of preparation (continued)  

Turkish lira and Ethiopian birr results and non-monetary asset and liability balances for the current financial year ended 31 March 2023 have been 
revalued to their present value equivalent local currency amount as at 31 March 2023, based on an inflation index, before translation to euros at the 
reporting date exchange rate of €1: 20.85 TRL and €1:58.59 ETB, respectively.   

For the Group’s operations in Turkey: 

− 

− 

− 

The gain or loss on net monetary assets resulting from IAS 29 application is recognised in the consolidated income statement within Other 
income.  

The Group also presents the gain or loss on cash and cash equivalents as monetary items together with the effect of inflation on operating, 
investing and financing cash flows as one number in the consolidated statement of cash flows.  

The Group has presented the IAS 29 opening balance adjustment to net assets within currency reserves in equity. Subsequent IAS 29 equity 
restatement effects and the impact of currency movements are presented within other comprehensive income because such amounts are 
judged to meet the definition of ‘exchange differences’.  

For Safaricom’s operations in Ethiopia, the impacts of IAS 29 accounting are reflected as an increase to Investments in associates and joint ventures 
and an increase to Equity.  

The inflation index in Turkey selected to reflect the change in purchasing power was the consumer price index (CPI) issued by the Turkish Statistical 
Institute which has risen by 50.5% during the current financial year ended 31 March 2023.The inflation index selected in Ethiopia is the CPI issued by 
the Ethiopian Statistics Service which rose 31.3% in the year ended 31 March 2023.

Foreign currencies 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is also the Company’s functional currency. Each entity in the Group determines 
its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.  

With the exception of the Group’s Turkish lira operations, which are subject to hyperinflation accounting (see above), transactions in foreign 
currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated into the respective functional currency of the entity at the rates prevailing on the reporting period date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the initial transaction 
dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 

Share capital, share premium and other capital reserves are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction 
and are not retranslated.  

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than euro are 
expressed in euro using exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period date. 

Income and expense items and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates for each month and exchange differences arising are 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative amount previously recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated 
income statement.  

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and 
translated accordingly. 

The net foreign exchange gain recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2023 is €111 million (31 March 2022: 
€309 million loss; 2021: €13 million loss). The net gains and net losses are recorded within operating profit (2023: €247 million credit; 2022: €24 
million charge; 2021: €3 million credit), financing costs (2023: €135 million charge; 2022: €284 million charge; 2021 €23 million charge) and

Current or non-current classification 
Assets are classified as current in the consolidated statement of financial position where recovery is expected within 12 months of the reporting 
date. All assets where recovery is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date and all deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment and investments in associates and joint ventures are reported as non-current. 

Liabilities are classified as current unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the 
reporting date. For provisions, where the timing of settlement is uncertain, amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected 
more than 12 months from the reporting date. In addition, deferred tax liabilities and post-employment benefits are reported as non-current. 

Inventory 
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the basis of weighted average costs and comprises direct 
materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition. 

New accounting pronouncements adopted on or after 1 April 2022  
The Group adopted the following new accounting policies on 1 April 2022 to comply with amendments to IFRS. The accounting pronouncements, 
none of which had a material impact on the Group’s financial reporting on adoption, are: 
− 

Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020;  

− 

− 

− 

Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use’; 

Amendments to IAS 37 ‘Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract’; and 

Amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Reference to the Conceptual Framework’.  

New accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2023 
The following new standards and narrow-scope amendments have been issued by the IASB and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2023:  
− 

IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’; 

− 

− 

− 

Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Disclosure of Accounting Policies’; 

Amendment to IAS 8 ‘Definition of Accounting Estimates’; and  

Amendment to IAS 12 ‘Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction’.  

These amendments have been endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board. The Group’s financial reporting will be presented in accordance with the 
above new standards from 1 April 2023. The amendments to IAS 1, IAS 8 and IAS 12 are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated 
income statement, consolidated statement of financial position or consolidated statement of cash flows. The impact of the adoption of IFRS 17 is 
addressed below.   

IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ 
IFRS 17 sets out revised principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts.  The Group issues certain 
short and long-term insurance contracts including device insurance and the reinsurance of a third-party annuity policy issued to the Vodafone and 
CWW Sections of the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme.  

The adoption of IFRS 17 will result in insurance and reinsurance liabilities being reclassified into a separate line item from Trade and other payables 
and Provisions.  The total reclassifications as at 1 April 2023 and for comparative periods are estimated to range from €400 million to €650 million, 
the largest element relating to the reinsurance of the third-party annuity policy (see Note 15 ‘Trade and other payables’ and Note 25 ‘Post 
employment benefits’). Prior periods will be re-presented on adoption of IFRS 17; no material adjustments are expected to equity or to the Group’s 
Consolidated Income Statement on adoption. 

The Group will issue further details on the impact of adopting IFRS 17 as part of the Interim Financial Statements for the six months ending 30 
September 2023. 

New accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2024 
The following amendments have been issued by the IASB and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024; they have not 
yet been endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board. 
− 

Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current’; Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Non-current Liabilities and Covenants’; and 

− 

Amendments to IFRS 16 ‘Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback’.  

The Group is assessing the impact of these new standards and the Group’s financial reporting will be presented in accordance with these standards 
from 1 April 2024 as applicable.

2. Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis 

The Group’s businesses are managed on a geographical basis. Selected financial data is presented on this basis below.  

Accounting policies 

Revenue  
When the Group enters into an agreement with a customer, goods and services deliverable under the contract are identified as separate 
performance obligations (‘obligations’) to the extent that the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own and that the separate 
goods and services are considered distinct from other goods and services in the agreement. Where individual goods and services do not meet the 
criteria to be identified as separate obligations they are aggregated with other goods and/or services in the agreement until a separate obligation is 
identified. The obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts, but might typically be separately identified for 
mobile handsets, other equipment such as set-top boxes and routers provided to customers and services provided to customers such as mobile and 
fixed line communication services. Where goods and services have a functional dependency (for example, a fixed line router can only be used with 
the Group’s services) this does not, in isolation, prevent those goods or services from being assessed as separate obligations. Activities relating to 
connecting customers to the Group’s network for the future provision of services are not considered to meet the criteria to be recognised as 
obligations except to the extent that the control of related equipment passes to customers.  

The Group determines the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled in return for providing the promised obligations to the customer based 
on the committed contractual amounts, net of sales taxes and discounts. Where indirect channel dealers, such as retailers, acquire customer 
contracts on behalf of the Group and receive commission, any commissions that the dealer is compelled to use to fund discounts or other 
incentives to the customer are treated as payments to the customer when determining the transaction price and consequently are not included in 
contract acquisition costs. 

The transaction price is allocated between the identified obligations according to the relative standalone selling prices of the obligations. The 
standalone selling price of each obligation deliverable in the contract is determined according to the prices that the Group would achieve by selling 
the same goods and/or services included in the obligation to a similar customer on a standalone basis; where standalone selling prices are not 
directly observable, estimation techniques are used maximising the use of external inputs. See ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 for details. Revenue is recognised when the respective obligations in the contract are delivered to the customer 
and cash collection is considered probable. Revenue for the provision of services, such as mobile airtime and fixed line broadband, is recognised 
when the Group provides the related service during the agreed service period. 

Revenue for device sales to end customers is generally recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer. For device sales made to 
intermediaries such as indirect channel dealers, revenue is recognised if control of the device has transferred to the intermediary and the 
intermediary has no right to return the device to receive a refund; otherwise revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end 
customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return. 

Where refunds are issued to customers they are deducted from revenue in the relevant service period. 

When the Group has control of goods or services prior to delivery to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer. As a 
principal, receipts from, and payments to, suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If another party has control of 
goods or services prior to transfer to a customer, then the Group is acting as an agent for the other party and revenue in respect of the relevant 
obligations is recognised net of any related payments to the supplier and recognised revenue represents the margin earned by the Group. See 
‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 for details. 

Customers typically pay in advance for prepay mobile services and monthly for other communication services. Customers typically pay for handsets 
and other equipment either up-front at the time of sale or over the term of the related service agreement.  

When revenue recognised in respect of a customer contract exceeds amounts received or receivable from a customer at that time a contract asset 
is recognised; contract assets will typically be recognised for handsets or other equipment provided to customers where payment is recovered by 
the Group via future service fees. If amounts received or receivable from a customer exceed revenue recognised for a contract, for example if the 
Group receives an advance payment from a customer, a contract liability is recognised. 

When contract assets or liabilities are recognised, a financing component may exist in the contract; this is typically the case when a handset or other 
equipment is provided to a customer up-front but payment is received over the term of the related service agreement, in which case the customer is 
deemed to have received financing. If a significant financing component is provided to the customer, the transaction price is reduced and interest 
revenue is recognised over the customer’s payment period using an interest rate reflecting the relevant central bank rates and customer credit risk. 

Contract-related costs 
When costs directly relating to a specific contract are incurred prior to recognising revenue for a related obligation, and those costs enhance the 
ability of the Group to deliver an obligation and are expected to be recovered, then those costs are recognised on the consolidated statement of 
financial position as fulfilment costs and are recognised as expenses in line with the recognition of revenue when the related obligation is delivered. 

The direct and incremental costs of acquiring a contract including, for example, certain commissions payable to staff or agents for acquiring 
customers on behalf of the Group, are recognised as contract acquisition cost assets in the consolidated statement of financial position when the 
related payment obligation is recorded. Costs are recognised as an expense in line with the recognition of the related revenue that is expected to be 
earned by the Group; typically this is over the customer contract period as new commissions are payable on contract renewal. Certain amounts 
payable to agents are deducted from revenue recognised (see above).

2. Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis (continued)  

Segmental analysis 

The Group’s operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the Group that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating 
decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group has determined the chief operating decision maker 
to be its Chief Executive. The Group has a single group of similar services and products, being the supply of communications services and related 
products.  

Vantage Towers A.G. (‘Vantage Towers’) has been presented as a separate segment of the Group since 1 April 2021, following its IPO in March 2021; 
the segmental presentation for the year ended 31 March 2021 was not revised.  Vantage Towers continued to be reported as a separate segment 
until the time of its disposal. 

From 1 April 2023, the Group will revise its segments by moving Vodafone Egypt from the Other Markets segment to the Vodacom segment to 
reflect the effective date of changes made to the Group’s internal reporting structure, following the transfer of Vodafone Egypt to the Vodacom 
group in December 2022. 

Revenue is attributed to a country based on the location of the Group company reporting the revenue. Transactions between operating segments 
are charged at arm’s-length prices.  

With the exception of Vodacom, which is a legal entity encompassing South Africa and certain other smaller African markets, and Vantage Towers, 
which comprises companies providing mobile tower infrastructure in a number of European markets, segment information is primarily provided on 
the basis of geographic areas, being the basis on which the Group manages its worldwide interests.  

The operating segments for Germany, Italy, UK, Spain and Vodacom are individually material for the Group and are each reporting segments for 
which certain financial information is provided.  In addition, the Vantage Towers operating segment was a separately listed part of the Group until its 
disposal into a joint venture on 22 March 2023 (see note 27 ‘Acquisitions and disposals’) and is presented as a reporting segment as it is considered 
to provide useful information to users of the financial statements. The aggregation of smaller operating segments into the Other Europe and Other 
Markets reporting segments reflects, in the opinion of management, the similar local market economic characteristics and regulatory environments 
for each of those operating segments as well as the similar products and services sold and comparable classes of customers. In the case of the 
Other Europe region (comprising Albania, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary (to the date of its disposal), Ireland, Portugal and Romania), this largely 
reflects membership or a close association with the European Union, while the Other Markets segment (comprising Egypt, Ghana (to the date of its 
disposal) and Turkey) largely includes developing economies with less stable economic or regulatory environments. Common Functions is a 
separate reporting segment and comprises activities which are undertaken primarily in central Group entities that do not meet the criteria for 
aggregation with other reporting segments.  

A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDAaL, the Group’s measure of segment profit, to the Group’s profit or loss before taxation for the financial year is 
shown below.

The results for the years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 have been re-presented to reflect that Indus Towers Limited is no longer reported as held for sale. In the year ended 31

increased by €149 million compared to amounts previously reported. In the year ended 31 March 2021, the share of result of equity accounted associates and joint ventures has increased by 
€32 million, operating profit has increased by €32 million and investment income has decreased by €85 million compared to amounts previously reported. See note 7 ‘Discontinued

4. Impairment losses 

Impairment occurs when the carrying value of assets is greater than the present value of the net cash flows they are 
expected to generate. We review the carrying value of assets for each country in which we operate at least annually. For 
further details of our impairment review process see ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ to the consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting policies 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as cash-
generating units. The determination of the Group’s cash-generating units is primarily based on the geographic area where the Group supplies 
communications services and products. If cash flows from assets within one jurisdiction are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets 
in that same jurisdiction and management monitors performance separately, multiple cash-generating units are identified within that geographic 
area.   

If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of 
each asset in the unit. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversible in subsequent periods. 

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 

Management prepares formal five year plans for the Group’s cash-generating units, which are the basis for the value in use calculations. 

Property, plant and equipment, finite lived intangible assets and equity accounted investments 
At each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment, finite lived intangible assets and equity-
accounted investments to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to 
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. 

If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or 
cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 

Where there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss 
reversal is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. 

Impairment loss 
Following our annual impairment review, the Group recognised an impairment loss in the consolidated income statement within operating profit 
relating to our investment in Indus Towers of €64 million in the current year.  Further detail on events that led to the recognition of this loss is 
included on page 141. No impairments were recognised for any other cash-generating units in the three years ended 31 March 2023.

4. Impairment losses (continued)  

Key assumptions used in the value in use calculations 
The key assumptions used in determining the value in use are: 

Assumption 
Projected adjusted 
EBITDAaL 

Projected capital 
expenditure 

How determined 

Projected adjusted EBITDAaL has been based on past experience adjusted for the following: 
-  In Europe, mobile revenue is expected to benefit from increased usage as customers transition to higher data 
bundles, and new products and services are introduced. Fixed revenue is expected to continue to grow as 
penetration is increased and more products and services are sold to customers; 

-  Outside of Europe, revenue is expected to continue to grow as the penetration of faster data-enabled devices 
rises along with higher data bundle attachment rates, and new products and services are introduced; and 

-  Margins are expected to be impacted by negative factors such as the cost of acquiring and retaining customers 

in increasingly competitive markets and by positive factors such as the efficiencies expected from the 
implementation of Group initiatives. 

The cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based on past experience and include the ongoing capital 
expenditure required to maintain our networks, provide products and services in line with customer expectations, 
including of higher data volumes and speeds, and to meet the population coverage requirements of certain of the 
Group’s licences. In Europe, capital expenditure is required to roll out capacity-building next generation 5G and 
gigabit networks. Outside of Europe, capital expenditure will be required for the continued rollout of current and 
next generation mobile networks in emerging markets. Capital expenditure includes cash outflows for the 
purchase of owned property, plant and equipment and computer software. 

Projected licence and 
spectrum payments 

To enable the continued provision of products and services, the cash flow forecasts for licence and spectrum 
payments for each relevant cash-generating unit include amounts for expected renewals and newly available 
spectrum. Beyond the five year forecast period, a long-run cost of spectrum is assumed. 

Long-term growth rate 

Pre-tax discount rate 

‑

term growth rate into perpetuity is applied 

For the purposes of the Group’s value in use calculations, a long
immediately at the end of the five year forecast period and is based on the lower of: 
-  the nominal GDP growth rate forecasts for the country of operation; and 
-  the long-term compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDAaL as estimated by management. 
Long-term compound annual growth rates determined by management may be lower than forecast nominal GDP 
growth rates due to the following market-specific factors: competitive intensity levels, maturity of business, 
regulatory environment or sector-specific inflation expectations. 
The pre-tax discount rate for each cash-generating unit is derived such that when applied to pre-tax cash flows it 
gives the same result as when the observable post-tax weighted average cost of capital is applied to post-tax cash 
flows.   
The assumptions used to develop discount rates for each cash-generating unit are benchmarked to externally 
available data.  
-  The risk free rate is derived from an average yield of a ten year bond issued by the government in each cash-

generating unit’s respective country of operations. 

-  The forward-looking equity market risk premium (an investor’s required rate return over and above a risk free 
rate) is based on studies by independent economists, the long-term average equity market risk premium and 
the market risk premiums typically used by valuation practitioners. 

-  The asset beta reflecting the systematic risk of the telecommunications segment relative to the market as a 

whole is determined from betas observed for comparable listed telecommunications companies. 

-  The region-specific leverage ratios are estimated from ratios observed for comparable listed 

telecommunications companies. 

Each cash-generating unit’s discount rate is determined in nominal terms in order to match their nominal 
estimates of future cash flows.  
Rising risk free interest rates and lower asset betas have, respectively, increased and decreased the cash-
generating unit discount rates in the current year.

Year ended 31 March 2023 

The Group performs its annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at 31 March and when there is an indicator of 
impairment of an asset. At each reporting period date judgement is exercised by management in determining whether any internal or external 
sources of information observed are indicative that the carrying amount of any of the Group’s cash generating units is not recoverable. For changes 
to the Group's cash-generating units in the current year see note 27 'Acquisitions and disposals'. 

Climate change 
As a large owner of infrastructure and consumer of energy, the Group has exposure to climate change related risks such as energy cost increases, 
asset damage and service disruption. The long range plans used in the Group’s impairment testing include forecast energy costs and other costs 
that are embedded in the planning process to deliver the Group’s zero carbon targets. The long range plans also include capital expenditure in 
relation to the Group’s use of durable and energy efficient infrastructure and the costs of the Group’s extensive and ongoing network maintenance 
programme. Climate change has not had a material impact on the outcome of the Group’s impairment testing. 

Indus Towers Limited 
The Group’s investment in Indus Towers was tested for impairment at 31 March 2023 following a decline in Indus Towers’ quoted share price in the 
current year. Management concluded that fair value less costs of disposal is the appropriate basis to determine the recoverable amount of the 
Group’s investment. Indus Towers’ share price is observable in a quoted market and is considered a level 1 input under the IFRS 13 fair value 
hierarchy. The share price of INR143.00 per share implied a recoverable amount of INR 81 billion (€0.9 billion) which was lower than the carrying 
value of the investment at the same date. An impairment charge of €64 million was recognised to reduce the carrying value of the Group’s 
investment to the recoverable amount in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position. 

Value in use assumptions 
The table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculations, and separately presented cash-generating units for which the carrying 
amount of goodwill is significant in comparison with the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill:

Sensitivity analysis 
The estimated recoverable amounts of the Group’s operations in Germany, Italy, the UK, and Spain exceed their carrying values by €3.2 billion, €0.2 
billion, €1.3 billion, and €0.4 billion respectively. If the assumptions used in the impairment review were changed to a greater extent than as 
presented in the following table, the changes would, in isolation, lead to an impairment loss being recognised for the year ended 31 March 2023.

Year ended 31 March 2022 

The disclosures below for the year ended 31 March 2022 are as previously disclosed in the 31 March 2022 Annual Report.  

The Group performs its annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at 31 March and when there is an indicator of 
impairment of an asset. At each reporting period date judgement is exercised by management in determining whether any internal or external 
sources of information observed are indicative that the carrying amount of any of the Group’s cash-generating units is not recoverable.  

As a large owner of infrastructure and consumer of energy, the Group has exposure to climate change related risks such as energy cost increases, 
asset damage and service disruption. The long range plans used in the Group’s impairment testing include forecast energy costs and other costs 
that are embedded in the planning process to deliver the Group’s zero carbon targets. The long range plans also include capital expenditure in 
relation to the Group’s use of durable and energy efficient infrastructure and the costs of the Group’s extensive and ongoing network maintenance 
programme. Furthermore, the Group will continue to develop strong reactive initiatives to manage the unpredictable impacts of future climate-
related risks. Climate change, therefore, has not had a material impact on the outcome of the Group’s impairment testing and the Group will 
continue to refine its approach to modelling climate-related risks and opportunities in the value in use calculations.  

As the war in Ukraine continues, it is challenging to predict the full extent and duration of its impact on the economy and the Group’s businesses. 
However, to assess a potential impact of this on the Group’s impairment testing, management prepared scenario analysis based on adjustments to 
the long range plans for high level estimates of market risks impacted by the war. This analysis did not indicate a risk of impairment at 31 March 
2022. Management will update the cash flows and assumptions used in the Group’s impairment testing at future reporting dates with latest best 
estimates. 

No impairments were recognised for the Group’s cash-generating units during the year to 31 March 2022.  

Value in use assumptions

Sensitivity analysis 
The estimated recoverable amounts of the Group’s operations in Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain exceed their carrying values by €7.3 billion, €0.4 
billion, €1.3 billion and €0.1 billion respectively. However, if the assumptions used in the impairment review were changed to a greater extent than 
as presented in the following table, the changes would, in isolation, lead to an impairment loss being recognised for the year ended 31 March 2022.

For the Group’s operations in Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain management has considered the following reasonably possible changes in pre-tax 
discount rate, long-term growth rate and projected adjusted EBITDAaL CAGR1 assumptions, leaving all other assumptions unchanged. The 
sensitivity analysis presented is prepared on the basis that the reasonably possible change in each key assumption would not have a consequential 
impact on other assumptions used in the impairment review. The associated impact on the impairment assessment is presented in the table below.   
Management has concluded that no reasonably possible or foreseeable change in projected capital expenditure2 would cause the difference 
between the carrying value and recoverable amount for any cash generating unit to be materially different to the base case disclosed below.

Year ended 31 March 2021 

Following the carve-out of Vodafone’s tower infrastructure to Vantage Towers A.G. (‘Vantage Towers’) during the year in Germany, Spain, Portugal, 
Ireland, Greece, Romania, Czech Republic and Hungary and the acquisitions by Vantage Towers of Vodafone UK’s 50% shareholding in Cornerstone 
Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited (‘CTIL’) and the remaining shareholding in the Vantage Towers Greece, management considers 
Vodafone’s operating companies and Vantage Tower’s operating companies in the affected geographical areas to represent two cash-generating 
units for the purpose of impairment testing as at 31 March 2021. Vodafone’s investment in Infrastrutture Wireless Italiane S.p.A. (‘INWIT’) was also 
transferred to Vantage Towers during the year. 

Goodwill has been allocated on a relative values basis to the Vantage Towers cash-generating units, where applicable, as part of the tower business 
carve out from Vodafone’s operations. The cash-generating units described below relate to Vodafone’s mobile and fixed line trading businesses, 
unless otherwise indicated as being part of Vantage Towers.

4. Impairment losses (continued)  

Sensitivity analysis 
The estimated recoverable amounts of the Group’s operations in Germany, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Romania and Vantage Towers Germany exceed their 
carrying values by €7.4 billion, €0.6 billion, €0.3 billion, €0.1 billion, €0.1 billion and €3.5 billion, respectively. If the assumptions used in the 
impairment review were changed to a greater extent than as presented in the following table, the changes would, in isolation, lead to an impairment 
loss being recognised for the year ended 31 March 2021.

Management considered the following reasonably possible changes in key assumptions for projected adjusted EBITDAaL CAGR1 and long-term 
growth rate, leaving all other assumptions unchanged. Consistent with the prior year, and due to the uncertainty of future COVID-19 impacts, 
management’s range of reasonably possible changes in projected adjusted EBITDAaL CAGR1 is plus or minus 5 percentage points (2020: +/- 5 
percentage points). The sensitivity analysis presented is prepared on the basis that the reasonably possible change in each key assumption would 
not have a consequential impact on other assumptions used in the impairment review. The associated impact on the impairment assessment is 
presented in the table below.  
Management believes that no reasonably possible or foreseeable change in the pre-tax discount rate or projected capital expenditure2 would cause 
the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount for any cash-generating unit to be materially different from the base case 
disclosed below.

6. Taxation 

This note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on 
our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or 
not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.  

Accounting policies 

Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes. 

Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement 
because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date. 

The Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management 
judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are 
assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate either using management’s estimate of the most likely 
outcome where the issues are binary, or the expected value approach where the issues have a range of possible outcomes. The Group recognises 
interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and any penalties, if applicable, as part of the income tax expense.  

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using 
the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 

Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to 
the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill. 

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s assessment that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date. 

Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they 
either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to 
settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 

Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly 
to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.

Factors affecting the tax charge in future years 
The Group’s future tax charge, and effective tax rate, could be affected by several factors including; tax reform in countries around the world, 
including any arising from the OECD’s or European Commission’s work on the taxation of the digital economy and European Commission initiatives 
such as the Minimum Tax directive or as a consequence of state aid investigations, future corporate acquisitions and disposals, any restructuring of 
our businesses and the resolution of open tax issues (see below). 

The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. The Group considers each issue on its merits and, 
where appropriate, holds provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise.  As at 31 March 2023, the Group holds provisions for such 
potential liabilities of €412 million (2022: €463 million). These provisions relate to multiple issues, across the jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates. The reduction follows the resolution of a number of disputes during the year. 

As the tax impact of a transaction can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process, the 
amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the Group's overall profitability and cash flows in 
future periods.  See Note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ to the consolidated financial statements. 

The tables below present the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward for the year ended 31 March 2023 and the 
comparative year ended 31 March 2022.

Deferred tax assets on losses in Luxembourg 
Included in the table above are losses of €65,232 million (2022: €65,348 million) that have arisen in Luxembourg companies. A deferred tax asset of 
€16,269 million (2022: €16,298 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses, as we conclude it is probable that the Luxembourg entities 
will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. These tax losses principally arose from historical 
impairments, primarily following the acquisition of the Mannesmann Group in 2000. These losses also arose prior to the 2017 tax reform in 
Luxembourg and are available to carry forward indefinitely. 

In December 2022, the Group undertook an internal restructuring which saw the Luxembourg companies dispose of their investments in the 
Group’s operating companies. This resulted in the Luxembourg holding companies recording a tax deductible loss on the disposal in the local GAAP 
financial statements. The investments are valued for the local GAAP financial statements using the Group’s recoverable value calculations (see 
Note 4 – 'Impairment losses') and the carrying values and valuation methodology differs from the goodwill assessment for the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.  

Losses incurred after the 2017 tax reform in Luxembourg expire after 17 years and are only used after any pre-existing losses. In the year ended 31 
March 2023 the Luxembourg companies incurred additional tax losses of €2,608 million following the disposals of their investments in the Group’s 
operating companies. No deferred tax asset is recognised for these losses on the basis that they are not forecast to be used prior to the expiry of 
their 17 year life. In a period where pre-existing tax losses are not utilised due to impairments, the forecast utilisation timeframe extends by one year.  

Following the restructuring, the losses in Luxembourg are no longer impacted by changes in the value of the Group’s operating companies and the 
recovery of the deferred tax asset will be driven by the recurring profits of the Luxembourg companies. 

These recurring profits are derived from the Group’s internal financing, centralised procurement and international roaming activities. These activities 
have consistently generated taxable profits of over €1 billion per annum throughout their existence.  The Group has reviewed the latest 5 year 
forecasts for the Luxembourg companies, including their ability to continue to generate income beyond this period. The forecasts consider the 
impact of the current market conditions on the existing financing activities, including the current view of interest rates, levels of intragroup 
financing, as well as the future profits generated from the procurement and roaming activities.   

This assessment also included a review of the commercial structures supporting the profits generated from these activities and considered the 
factors, under the Group’s control, which could impact the ability of these activities to generate taxable profits. We have assessed that the current 
structure continues to be sustainable under the tax laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and the Group’s intentions to keep these 
activities in Luxembourg remains unchanged.

6. Taxation (continued)  

Based on the current forecasts, €4,518 million (2022: €3,546 million) of the deferred tax asset is forecast to be used within the next 10 years, and 
€8,742 million (2022: €6,953 million) used within 20 years. The losses are projected to be fully utilised over the next 35 to 39 years. The decrease in 
the recovery period over the prior year is principally a result of higher interest rates, driving margins up on existing financing activities. In the year 
ended 31 March 2022 these same factors also meant the Group recognised €699 million of previously unrecognised deferred tax asset as the 
forecasts produced at that time, which reflected the same factors discussed above, showed these losses will be used within 60 years. The Group did 
not previously recognise the asset as the losses were forecast to be used beyond 60 years. 

An increase or decrease in the forecast income in Luxembourg in each year of 5%-10% would change the period over which the losses will be fully 
utilised by 2 to 4 years. The Group uses these different scenarios of forecast income to understand the impact that a change in interest rates or level 
of debt advanced by the Luxembourg companies could have on the recovery period of the losses. 

Any future changes in tax law, including those driven by OECD, EU or domestic tax reforms or the structure of the Group could have a significant 
effect on the use of the Luxembourg losses, including the period over which these losses can be utilised. The Group has continued to monitor 
developments relating to OECD’s Pillar 2 rules, including reviewing the administrative guidance published in December 2022 and does not 
anticipate a significant impact on its ability to continue to use our losses in Luxembourg. On the basis that future changes in tax laws are unknown, 
the profit forecasts assume that existing tax laws continue. 

Based on the above factors the Group concludes that it is probable that the Luxembourg companies will continue to generate taxable profits in the 
future against which it will use these losses. 

In addition to the above, €15,925 million (2022; €13,298 million) of the Group’s Luxembourg losses expire after 11-17 years and no deferred tax 
asset is recognised as they will expire before we can use these losses.  The remaining losses do not expire. We also have €9,136 million (2022: 
€9,136 million) of Luxembourg losses in a former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group company, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised 
as it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised. 

Deferred tax assets on losses in Germany 
The Group has tax losses of €12,932 million (2022: €13,955 million) in Germany arising on the write down of investments in Germany in 2000.  The 
losses are available to use against both German federal and trade tax liabilities and they do not expire. A deferred tax asset of €2,021 million (2022: 
€2,170 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the German business will continue to generate 
taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.  The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the German business which 
incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business (see Note 4 ‘Impairment losses’).  In the period beyond the 5 
year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent in the terminal period and based on these and our expectations for the German business we 
believe it is probable the German losses will be fully utilised. Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 4 to 9 years. 
A 5%-10% change in the forecast profits of the German business would alter the utilisation period by 1 year. 

Deferred tax assets in Italy 
The Group has a recognised deferred tax asset of €425 million (2022: €411 million), including €152 million (2022: €71 million) relating to tax losses 
in Italy. The Italian business has historically been profitable and is forecasted to return to profitability, absent the tax deductions arising from the 
revaluation of assets undertaken in the year ended 31 March 2022, in the short term. The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the Italian 
business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business (see Note 4 ‘Impairment losses’).  In the period 
beyond the 5 year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent in the terminal period and based on these and our expectations for the Italian 
business we believe it is probable the Italian losses will be fully utilised. 

Deferred tax assets on losses in Spain 
The Group has tax losses of €5,130 million (2022: €4,627 million) which are available to offset against the future profits of the Grupo Corporativo 
ONO business.  The losses do not expire, and no deferred tax asset is recognised for these losses due to the trading environment in Spain. 

Other tax losses 
The Group has losses amounting to €2,377 million (2022: €8,444 million) in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against 
future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised, as in the prior year. The 
losses reduced following the dissolution of a UK holding company which held capital losses. The remaining losses relate to a number of other 
jurisdictions across the Group. There are also €2,443 million (2022: €2,365 million) of unrecognised temporary differences relating to treasury items 
and other items.  

Impact of climate risks 
The recovery of the Group’s deferred tax assets is dependent on its forecasts of future profitability and the climate related risks have been 
considered in the Group’s assessment of the recovery of those assets (see Note 4 ‘Impairment losses’). The Group does not expect the climate 
related risks to have an impact on the ability of Luxembourg to continue to provide the internal financing, procurement, and roaming activities to 
other members of the Group.  

Unremitted earnings 
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further €26,371 million (2022: €8,599 million) of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries 
because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.

7. Discontinued operations and assets held for sale 

The Group classifies certain of its assets that it expects to dispose as either discontinued operations or as held for sale.     

The Group classifies non-current assets and assets and liabilities within disposal groups (‘assets’) as held for sale if the assets are available 
immediately for sale in their present condition, management is committed to a plan to sell the assets under usual terms, it is highly probable that 
their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and the sale is expected to be 
completed within one year from the date of the initial classification.  

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the consolidated statement of financial position and are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not 
depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. Similarly, equity accounting ceases for associates and joint ventures held for sale.   

Where operations constitute a separately reportable segment (see note 2 ‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’) and have been 
disposed of, or are classified as held for sale, the Group classifies such operations as discontinued.  

Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from 
discontinued operations in the Group consolidated income statement. Discontinued operations are also excluded from segment reporting. All other 
notes to the financial statements include amounts for continuing operations, unless indicated otherwise.  

Discontinued operations 
The Group did not have any discontinued operations in the year ended 31 March 2023 or the comparative years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 
March 2021.   

Assets held for sale 
Reclassification of Indus Towers Limited 
In the consolidated financial statements for the prior year ended 31 March 2022, the Group’s 21.0% interest in Indus Towers Limited was reported 
within assets held for sale. Whilst the Group remains focused on achieving a sale, the investment is not assessed as meeting the requirements of 
held for sale at 31 March 2023. Consequently, comparative balances as at 31 March 2022 have been re-presented in these consolidated financial 
statements to reflect that Indus Towers Limited is no longer reported as held for sale.   

Impact on the consolidated income statement 
The reclassification has no impact on previously reported revenue and gross profit, as reported in the consolidated income statement.   

In the year ended 31 March 2022, the share of results of equity accounted associates and joint ventures increased by €178 million, offset by a 
decrease of €29 million in other income. Consequently, operating profit, profit before taxation and profit for the financial year all increased by €149 
million compared to amounts previously reported. Total comprehensive income for the financial year increased by €144 million, reflecting the 
increase in profit for the financial year of €149 million, offset by a charge of €5 million included in other comprehensive income.  

In the year ended 31 March 2021, the share of results of equity accounted associates and joint ventures increased by €32 million and therefore 
operating profit increased by €32 million compared to the amount previously reported. Investment income decreased by €85 million and therefore 
profit before taxation and profit for the financial year both decreased by €53 million compared to amounts previously reported. Total 
comprehensive expense for the financial year increased by €48 million, reflecting the decrease in profit for the financial year of €53 million, offset

8. Earnings per share  

8. Earnings per share  

10. Intangible assets  

The statement of financial position contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill and licences 
and spectrum. Goodwill, which arises when we acquire a business and pay a higher amount than the fair value of its net 
assets primarily due to the synergies we expect to create, is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews. 
Licences and spectrum are amortised over the life of the licence. For further details see ‘Critical accounting judgements 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation ‘ to the consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting policies 
Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset 
will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised at fair value when the Group 
completes a business combination. The determination of the fair values of the separately identified intangibles, is based, to a considerable extent, 
on management’s judgement. 

Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition. 

Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not 
subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is evidence that it may be impaired. Goodwill is denominated in the 
currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing exchange rate at each reporting period date.

Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement. 

On disposal of a subsidiary or a joint arrangement, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
recognised in the income statement on disposal. 

Finite lived intangible assets 
Intangible assets with finite lives are stated at acquisition or development cost, less accumulated amortisation. The amortisation period and method 
is reviewed at least annually. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in 
the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. 

Licence and spectrum fees 
Amortisation periods for licence and spectrum fees are determined primarily by reference to the unexpired licence period, the conditions for licence 
renewal and whether licences are dependent on specific technologies. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful lives from the commencement of related network services. 

Computer software 
Computer software comprises software purchased from third parties as well as the cost of internally developed software. Computer software 
licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. Costs that are directly associated with 
the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and are probable of producing future economic benefits, are 
recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs of software development include employee costs and directly attributable overheads. 

Software integral to an item of hardware equipment is classified as property, plant and equipment.  

Costs associated with maintaining software programs are recognised as an expense when they are incurred.  

Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life from the date the software is available for 
use. 

Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets, including brands and customer bases, are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortisation is charged to the 
income statement, over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date they are available for use, on a straight-line basis. The 
amortisation basis adopted for each class of intangible asset reflects the Group’s consumption of the economic benefit from that asset.  

Estimated useful lives 
The estimated useful lives of finite lived intangible assets are as follows: 

Licence and spectrum fees 
Computer software 
Brands 
Customer bases

11. Property, plant and equipment  

The Group makes significant investments in network equipment and infrastructure – the base stations and technology 
required to operate our networks – that form the majority of our tangible assets. All assets are depreciated over their 
useful economic lives. For further details on the estimation of useful economic lives, see ‘Critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation ‘to the consolidated financial 
statements. 

Accounting policies 
Land and buildings held for use are stated in the statement of financial position at their cost, less any accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 

Amounts for equipment, fixtures and fittings, which includes network infrastructure assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 

Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment losses. Depreciation of these assets commences when the 
assets are ready for their intended use. 

The cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation. 

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives, as 
follows: 

Land and buildings

Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. 

Right-of-use assets arising from the Group’s lease arrangements are depreciated over their reasonably certain lease term, as determined under the 
Group’s leases policy (see note 20 ‘Leases’ and ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 for details).  

The gain or loss arising on the disposal, retirement or granting of a finance lease on an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between any proceeds from sale or receivables arising on a lease and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income 
statement.

12. Investments in associates and joint arrangements 

The Group holds interests in associates in Kenya and in India, where we have significant influence, as well as in a 
number of joint arrangements, notably in the Netherlands, India, Australia and now Oak Holdings 1 GmbH and its 
markets, where we share control with one or more third parties. For further details see ‘Critical accounting judgements 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation ‘to the consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting policies 
Interests in joint arrangements 
A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint 
control; that is, when the relevant activities that significantly affect the investee’s returns require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing 
control. Joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint ventures.  

Gains or losses resulting from the contribution or sale of a subsidiary as part of the formation of a joint arrangement are recognised in respect of 
the Group’s entire equity holding in the subsidiary. 

Joint operations 
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, 
relating to the arrangement or that other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case. The Group’s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, 
expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Group’s interest in a joint operation is accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy 
for goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary. 

Joint ventures 
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement.  

At the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the joint venture is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.  

The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures, other than those joint ventures or part thereof that are held for sale (see note 7 ‘Discontinued 
operations and assets held for sale’), are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the 
equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost adjusted for post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment. The Group’s share of post-tax 
profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group’s interest in that joint venture 
are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. 

Associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint arrangement.  

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but where the Group does not have 
control or joint control over those policies.  

At the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the associate is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.  

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the same equity method of 
accounting used for joint ventures, described above.  

Joint operations 
On 22 March 2023, the Group completed the disposal of its principal joint operation as part of the transaction with Oak Holdings 1 GmbH. The 
financial and operating activities of the operation were jointly controlled by the participating shareholders and were primarily designed for all but an 
insignificant amount of the output to be consumed by the shareholders.

3  At 31 March 2023 the fair value of the Group’s interest in TPG Telecom Limited was AUD 2,273 million (€1,401 million) (2022: AUD 2,818 million (€1,902 million)) based on the quoted share 

price on ASX.  

Oak Holdings 1 GmbH 
On 22 March 2023, the Group completed the disposal of its interest in Vantage Towers A.G. to Oak Holdings 1 GmbH, the co-control partnership of 
Vodafone, GIP and KKR. Vodafone retained an interest of 64.2% in Oak Holdings 1 GmbH, which owns 89.3% of Vantage Towers A.G. On 18 April 
2023, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of Vantage Towers A.G. published their joint reasoned statement on the public delisting 
tender offer of Oak Holdings 1 GmbH to the shareholders of Vantage Towers A.G. Both recommended that all remaining shareholders accept the 
delisting tender offer.    

OXG Glasfaser GmbH 
In March 2023, the Group entered into an agreement with Altice Luxembourg S.A. to create a joint venture, OXG Glasfaser GmbH (‘OXG’), with 50.0% 
shareholding held by each shareholder. Each shareholder is committed to contribute funding of up to €950 million to OXG for the deployment of 
fibre-to-the-home in Germany.  The funding is expected to be contributed between 2023 and 2029.  The amount and timing of the funding depends 
on the speed and size of the fibre deployment so the funding may be for a lower value or contributed over a longer period of time. The contribution 
can be in the form of free capital reserves, shareholder loan, loan notes or similar instruments as agreed by the shareholders. 

Vodafone Idea Limited 
The Group’s carrying value in Vodafone Idea Limited (‘VIL’) reduced to €nil at 30 September 2019. The Group’s share of VIL’s losses not recognised 
at 31 March 2023 is €3,759 million (31 March 2022: €5,120 million). Significant uncertainties exist in relation to VIL’s ability to generate the cash 
flow it requires to settle or its ability to refinance its liabilities and guarantees as they fall due (see note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal 
proceedings’). 

The value of the Group’s 21.0% shareholding in Indus Towers Limited is, in part, dependent on the income generated by Indus Towers Limited from 
tower rentals to major customers, including VIL. Any inability of these major customers to pay such amounts in the future may impact the carrying 
value (31 March 2023: €908 million) of the Group’s investment in Indus Towers Limited.

13. Other investments 

The Group holds a number of other listed and unlisted investments, mainly comprising managed funds, 
deposits and government bonds. 
Accounting policies 
Other investments comprising debt and equity instruments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an 
investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, 
and are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs. 

Debt securities that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and 
interest are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Debt securities that do not meet the 
criteria for amortised cost are measured at fair value through profit and loss.  

Equity securities are classified and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of 
fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following derecognition of the investment.

Non-current debt securities within non-current assets include €885 million (2022: €885 million) of loan notes issued by VodafoneZiggo 
Holding B.V. 

The Group invests surplus cash positions across a portfolio of short-term investments to manage liquidity and credit risk whilst achieving 
suitable returns. Collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments result in cash being paid/(held), repayable when the 
derivatives are settled. These assets do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents but are included in the Group’s net debt based 
on their liquidity. 

Bonds and debt securities includes €899 million (2022: €681 million) of highly liquid Japanese; €290 million (2022: €nil) Dutch; €150 
million (2022: €nil) German; €nil (2022: €501 million) Belgian; €nil (2022: €200 million) French government securities and €nil (2022: €64 
million) of UK government bonds. 

Managed investment funds of €2,967 million (2022: €3,349 million) are in funds with liquidity of up to 90 days. 

Collateral assets of €239 million (2022: €698 million) represents collateral paid on derivative financial instruments.   

Other investments are excluded from net debt based on their liquidity and primarily consist of restricted debt securities including amounts 
held in qualifying assets by Group insurance companies to meet regulatory requirements.

14. Trade and other receivables 

Trade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers and amounts that we pay to our 
suppliers in advance. Derivative financial instruments with a positive market value are reported within this note as are 
contract assets, which represent an asset for accrued revenue in respect of goods or services delivered to customers for 
which a trade receivable does not yet exist, and finance lease receivables recognised where the Group acts as a lessor. 
See note 20 ‘Leases’ for more information on the Group’s leasing activities. 

Accounting policies 
Trade receivables represent amounts owed by customers where the right to receive payment is conditional only on the passage of time. Trade 
receivables that are recovered in instalments from customers over an extended period are discounted at market rates and interest revenue is 
accreted over the expected repayment period. Other trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value. When the 
Group establishes a practice of selling portfolios of receivables from time to time these portfolios are recorded at fair value through other 
comprehensive income; all other trade receivables are recorded at amortised cost. 

The carrying value of all trade receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables recorded at amortised cost is reduced by allowances for 
lifetime estimated credit losses. Estimated future credit losses are first recorded on the initial recognition of a receivable and are based on the 
ageing of the receivable balances, historical experience and forward looking considerations. Individual balances are written off when management 
deems them not to be collectible.

Includes €198 million (2022: €3 million) of embedded derivative option for which fair value is based on level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see section on fair value carrying value information 
within note 22 ‘Capital and Risk Management’). All other items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 2 classification, which comprises items where fair value is determined 
from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 

The Group’s trade receivables and contract assets are classified at amortised cost unless stated otherwise and are measured after allowances for 
future expected credit losses, see note 22 ‘Capital and financial risk management’ for more information on credit risk.  

The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, which are measured at amortised cost, approximate their fair value and are predominantly 
non-interest bearing.  

The Group’s contract-related costs comprise €2,078 million (2022: €1,967 million) relating to costs incurred to obtain customer contracts and €83 
million (2022: €66 million) relating to costs incurred to fulfil customer contracts; an amortisation and impairment expense of €1,541 million (2022: 
€1,517 million) was recognised in operating profit during the year. 

Other than for the embedded derivative option described above, the fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting 
the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 

16. Provisions 

A provision is a liability recorded in the statement of financial position, where there is uncertainty over the timing or 
amount that will be paid, and is therefore often estimated. The main provisions we hold are in relation to asset 
retirement obligations, which include the cost of returning network infrastructure sites to their original condition at the 
end of the lease and claims for legal and regulatory matters.  

Accounting policies 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Where 
the timing of settlement is uncertain amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date. 

Asset retirement obligations 
In the course of the Group’s activities, a number of sites and other assets are utilised which are expected to have costs associated with decommissioning. 
The associated cash outflows are substantially expected to occur at the dates of decommissioning of the assets to which they relate, and are long term in 
nature. 

Legal and regulatory 
The Group is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including where the Group has received notifications of possible claims. The 
Directors of the Company, after taking legal advice, have established provisions considering the facts of each case. For a discussion of 
certain legal issues potentially affecting the Group see note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ to the consolidated financial 
statements. 

Restructuring 
The Group undertakes periodic reviews of its operations and recognises provisions as required based on the outcomes of these 
reviews. The associated cash outflows for restructuring costs are primarily less than one year. 

Other provisions 
Other provisions comprise various items that do not fall within the Group’s other categories of provisions.

Note: 
1  The results for the years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 have been re-presented to reflect that Indus Towers Limited is no longer reported as held for sale. In the year ended 31 
March 2022, profit for the financial year and operating profit have both increased by €149 million, other income has decreased by €29 million and the share of result of equity accounted 
associates and joint ventures has increased by €178 million compared to the amounts previously reported. In the year ended 31 March 2021, profit for the financial year has decreased by 
€53 million, investment income has decreased by €85 million, operating profit has increased by €32 million and the share of result of equity accounted associates and joint ventures has 
increased by €32 million compared to the amounts previously reported. There is no impact on cash generated by operations and net cash flow from operating activities. See note 7 
‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ for more information.     

19. Cash and cash equivalents 

The majority of the Group’s cash is held in bank deposits or money market funds which have a maturity of three months 
or less from acquisition to enable us to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.  

Accounting policies 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Assets in money market funds, whose contractual cash flows do not 
represent solely payments of interest and principal, are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included in net 
profit or loss for the period. All other cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.

18. Reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities  

20. Leases 

The Group leases assets from other parties (the Group is a lessee) and also leases assets to other parties (the Group is a 
lessor).  This note describes how the Group accounts for leases and provides details about its lease arrangements. 

Accounting policies 
As a lessee 
When the Group leases an asset, a ‘right-of-use asset’ is recognised for the leased item and a lease liability is recognised for any lease payments to 
be paid over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, being the present value of the 
lease payments paid or payable, plus any initial direct costs incurred in entering the lease and less any lease incentives received.  

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the asset’s useful life or the 
end of the lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any periods for which the Group is ‘reasonably certain’ to 
exercise any extension options (see below). The useful life of the asset is determined in a manner consistent to that for owned property, plant and 
equipment (as described in note 11 ‘Property, plant and equipment’). If right-of-use assets are considered to be impaired, the carrying value is 
reduced accordingly.  

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the value of the lease payments over the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date and are 
usually discounted using the incremental borrowing rates of the applicable Group entity (the rate implicit in the lease is used if it is readily 
determinable). Lease payments included in the lease liability include both fixed payments and in-substance fixed payments during the term of the 
lease.  

After initial recognition, the lease liability is recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change 
in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate (e.g. an inflation related increase) or if the Group’s assessment of the lease term 
changes; any changes in the lease liability as a result of these changes also results in a corresponding change in the recorded right-of-use asset.   

As a lessor 
Where the Group is a lessor, it determines at inception whether the lease is a finance or an operating lease. When a lease transfers substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset then the lease is a finance lease; otherwise the lease is an operating lease.  

Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the interests in the head lease and the sub-lease are accounted for separately and the lease classification 
of a sub-lease is determined by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.  

Income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Income from finance leases is recognised at lease 
commencement with interest income recognised over the lease term.  

Lease income is recognised as revenue for transactions that are part of the Group’s ordinary activities (i.e. primarily leases of handsets or other 
equipment to customers, leases of wholesale access to the Group’s fibre and cable networks and leases of tower infrastructure assets). The Group 
uses IFRS 15 principles to allocate the consideration in contracts between any lease and non-lease components.  

The Group’s leasing activities as a lessee 
The Group leases buildings for its retail stores, offices and data centres, land on which to construct mobile base stations, space on mobile base 
stations to place active RAN equipment and network space (primarily rack space or duct space). In addition, the Group leases fibre and other fixed 
connectivity to provide internal connectivity for the Group’s operations and on a wholesale basis from other operators to provide fixed connectivity 
services to the Group’s customers.  

The Group’s general approach to determining lease term by class of asset is described in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ under critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty.  

Most of the Group’s leases include future price increases through fixed percentage increases, indexation to inflation measures on a periodic basis or 
rent review clauses. Other than fixed percentage increases the lease liability does not reflect the impact of these future increases unless the 
measurement date has passed. The Group’s leases contain no material variable payments clauses other than those related to the number of 
operators sharing space on third party mobile base stations.

20. Leases (continued)  

Optional lease periods 
Where practicable the Group seeks to include extension or break options in leases to provide operational flexibility, therefore many of the Group’s 
lease contracts contain optional periods. The Group’s policy on assessing and reassessing whether it is reasonably certain that the optional period 
will be included in the lease term is described in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ under ‘critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty’.  

After initial recognition of a lease, the Group only reassesses the lease term when there is a significant event or a significant change in 
circumstances, which was not anticipated at the time of the previous assessment. Significant events or significant changes in circumstances could 
include merger and acquisition or similar activity, significant expenditure on the leased asset not anticipated in the previous assessment, or detailed 
management plans indicating a different conclusion on optional periods to the previous assessment. Where a significant event or significant change 
in circumstances does not occur, the lease term and therefore lease liability and right-of-use asset value, will decline over time.  

The Group’s cash outflow for leases in the year ended 31 March 2023 was €4,479 million (2022: €4,338 million). Following changes to the Group’s 
structure during the year, it is expected that future annual cash outflows will increase by circa €300 million absent significant future changes in the 
volume of the Group’s activities or strategic changes to use more or fewer owned assets, subject to contractual price increases. The future cash 
outflows included within lease liabilities are shown in the maturity analysis below. The maturity analysis only includes the reasonably certain 
payments to be made; cash outflows in these future periods will likely exceed these amounts as payments will be made on optional periods not 
considered reasonably certain at present and on new leases entered into in future periods. 

The Group’s leases for customer connectivity are normally either under regulated access or network sharing or similar preferential access 
arrangements and as a result the Group normally has significant flexibility over the term it can lease such connections for; generally the notice 
period required to cancel the lease is less than the notice period included in the service contract with the end customer.  As a result, the Group does 
not have any significant cash exposure to optional periods on customer connectivity as the Group can cancel the lease when the service agreement 
ends. In some circumstances the Group is committed to minimum spend amounts for connectivity leases, which are included within reported lease 
liabilities.  

Sale and leaseback 
In March 2023, the Group disposed of its interest in Vantage Towers A.G. (‘Vantage Towers’) into a new joint venture, Oak Holdings 1 GmbH (‘Oak’); 
Vodafone retains an interest of 64.2% in Oak, which owns 89.3% of Vantage Towers (see note 27 ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ for additional details). 
The Group has agreements with Vantage Towers to lease back spaces on its towers (see note 30 ‘Related party transactions’). The Group de-
recognised assets related to the mobile base stations with a net book value of €4,793 million. A total net gain on disposal of €9,287 million was 
realised as a result of the disposal of Vantage Towers; €680 million of this gain, reflecting the gain on the proportion of sold towers that has been 
retained through the leaseback, has been recorded as a reduction in the value of the right-of-use asset recognised for the leaseback of tower space 
and will be realised as a reduction in depreciation over the term of the leaseback until November 2028. Other sale and leaseback transactions 
entered into by the Group were not material, individually or in aggregate. 

Amounts recognised in the primary financial statements in relation to lessee transactions 
Right-of-use assets 
The carrying value of the Group’s right-of-use assets, depreciation charge for the year and additions during the year are disclosed in note 11 
‘Property, plant and equipment’. 

Lease liabilities 
The Group’s lease liabilities are disclosed in note 21 ‘Borrowings’. The maturity profile of the Group’s lease liabilities is as follows:    

Within one year 
In more than one year but less than two years 
In more than two years but less than three years 
In more than three years but less than four years 
In more than four years but less than five years

million) that had not commenced at 31 March 2023.  

Interest expense on lease liabilities for the year is disclosed in note 5 ‘Investment income and financing costs’. 

The Group has no material liabilities under residual value guarantees and makes no material variable payments not included in the lease liability. 
The Group does not apply either the short term or low value expedient options in IFRS 16.

The Group’s leasing activities as a lessor 
The Group has a wide range of lessor activities with consumer and enterprise customers, other telecommunication companies and other 
companies. With consumer and enterprise customers, the Group generates lease income from the provision of handsets, routers and other 
communications equipment. The Group provides wholesale access to the Group’s fibre and cable networks, leases out space on the Group’s owned 
mobile base stations to other telecommunication companies and sub-leases certain retained mobile base station sites to telecommunication tower 
companies. In addition, the Group sub-leases retail stores to franchise partners in certain markets and leases out surplus assets (e.g. vacant offices 
and retail stores) to other companies. 

Lessor transactions are classified as operating or finance leases based on whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership of the asset. Leases are individually assessed, but generally, the Group’s lessor transactions in the year are classified as: 
- 

Operating leases where the Group provides wholesale access to its fibre and cable networks, provides routers or similar equipment to fixed 
customers or is lessor of space on owned mobile base stations; and 

- 

Finance leases where the Group is sub-lessor of handsets or similar items in back-to-back arrangements or where surplus assets or certain 
retained mobile base stations sites are sublet out for all or substantially all of the remaining head lease term. 

The Group’s income as a lessor in the year is as follows:  

Operating leases 
Lease revenue (note 2 ‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’) 
Income from leases not recognised as revenue 

Substantially all of the Group’s income as a lessor is operating lease income.

21. Borrowings 

The Group’s sources of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes come from a range of committed bank facilities 
and through short-term and long-term issuances in the capital markets including bond and commercial paper issues 
and bank loans. Liabilities arising from the Group’s lease arrangements are also reported in borrowings; see note 20 
‘Leases’. We manage the basis on which we incur interest on debt between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates 
depending on market conditions using interest rate derivatives. The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to 
mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements on certain monetary items. 

Accounting policies 
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception), and are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated fair value hedge relationship, fair 
value adjustments are recognised in accordance with our policy (see note 22 ‘Capital and financial risk management’). Any difference between the 
proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing. 
Where bonds issued with certain conversion rights are identified as compound instruments they are initially measured at fair value with the nominal 
amounts recognised as a component in equity and the fair value of future coupons included in borrowings. These are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Includes €1,140 million (2022: €1,273 million) and €196 million (2022: €2,165 million) of licence and spectrum fees payable in non-current and current borrowings respectively. 

The fair value of the Group’s financial liabilities held at amortised cost approximate to fair value with the exception of long-term bonds with a 
carrying value of €39,512 million (2022: €46,156 million) which have a fair value of €35,044 million (2022: €46,348 million). Fair value is based on 
level 1 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices. 

The Group’s current borrowings also include €1,485 million (2022: €1,382 million) of bank borrowings that are secured against the Group’s 
shareholdings in Indus Towers and Vodafone Idea (see note 12 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ for further details of these assets) and 
will be repaid through the realisation of proceeds from those assets. This arrangement contains an embedded derivative option which has been 
separately fair valued and is presented within derivative assets in current assets (see note 14 ‘Trade and other receivables’). 

The Group’s borrowings, which include certain bonds that have been designated in hedge relationships, are carried at €1,282 million higher (2022: 
€1,316 million higher) than their euro equivalent redemption value. In addition, where bonds are issued in currencies other than euros, the Group 
has entered into foreign currency swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption. The impact of these swaps is not reflected in borrowings and 
would decrease the euro equivalent redemption value of the bonds by €1,440 million (2022: €1,456 million).

Commercial paper programmes  
We currently have US and euro commercial paper programmes of US$15 billion (€13.8 billion) and €10 billion respectively which are available to be 
used to meet short-term liquidity requirements. At 31 March 2023 both programmes remained undrawn.  

The commercial paper facilities were supported by US$4.0 billion (€3.7 billion) and €4.0 billion of syndicated committed bank facilities. No amounts 
had been drawn under these facilities. 

Bonds 
We have two €30 billion euro medium-term note programmes and a US shelf programme which are used to meet medium to long-term funding 
requirements. At 31 March 2023 the total amounts in issue under these programmes split by currency were US$21.3 billion, €17.6 billion, £3.6 
billion, AUD$0.5 billion, HKD$2.1 billion, NOK2.2 billion, CHF0.7 billion and JPY10 billion.  

At 31 March 2023 the Group had bonds outstanding with a nominal value equivalent to €42.8 billion. During the year ended 31 March 2023, bonds 
with a nominal value of €1.8 billion and £0.6 billion were issued utilising the euro medium-term note programme and US$1.2 billion were issued 
utilising the US Shelf programme. During the year bonds with euro equivalent nominal values of €1.9 billion and €3.8 billion matured and were re-
purchased respectively. 

Bonds mature between 2023 and 2063 (2022: 2022 and 2059) and have interest rates between 0.375% and 7.875% (2022: 0% and 7.875%). 

Mandatory convertible bonds 
In March 2023 the Group concluded the last remaining share buybacks related to the mandatory convertible bonds (‘MCBs’) and no further 
instruments remain outstanding. On 12 March 2019 the Group issued £3.4 billion of subordinated mandatory convertible bonds (‘MCBs’) split into 
two equal tranches of £1.7 billion with coupons of 1.2% and 1.5% respectively. The first tranche matured on 12 March 2021 at a conversion price of 
£1.2055 per share and the second tranche matured on 12 March 2022 at a conversion price of £1.1326 per share. These were recognised as 
compound instruments with nominal values of £3.4 billion (€3.8 billion) recognised as a component of shareholders’ funds in equity and the fair 
value of future coupons £0.1 billion (€0.1 billion) recognised as a financial liability in borrowings. The Group’s strategy was to hedge the equity risk 
associated with the MCB issuance to any future movement in its share price by an option strategy designed to hedge the economic impact of share 
price movements. The Group decided to buy back ordinary shares to mitigate dilution resulting from the conversion and the hedging 
strategy provided a hedge for the repurchase price. 

Treasury shares 
The Group held a maximum of 1,825,691,429 (2022: 1,911,661,729) of its own shares during the year which represented 6.3% (2022: 6.6%) of 
issued share capital at that time.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 

22. Capital and financial risk management 

This note details the treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well as 
the exposure and sensitivity of the Group to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange risk, and the policies in place 
to monitor and manage these risks.  

Accounting policies 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Group’s consolidated statement of financial 
position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 

Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that provides a residual interest in the 
assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies 
adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below. 

Financial liabilities under put option arrangements 
The Group has an obligation to pay a fixed rate of return to minority equity shareholders in the Group’s subsidiary Kabel Deutschland AG, under the 
terms of a court-imposed domination and profit and loss transfer agreement. This agreement also provides the minority shareholders the option to 
put their shareholding to Vodafone at a fixed price per share. The obligation to purchase the shares has been recognised as a financial liability and no 
non-controlling interests are recognised in respect of minority shareholders. Interest costs are accrued at the agreed rate of return and recognised 
in financing costs. 

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative 
financial instruments. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. The Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes. 

The Group designates certain derivatives as: 
− 

hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (‘fair value hedges’); 

− 

− 

hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments (‘cash flow hedges’); or 

hedges of net investments in foreign operations. 

Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each 
reporting date. Changes in values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the income 
statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship or a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations when the effective 
portion of changes in value are deferred to other comprehensive income. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge 
relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item 
and hedging instrument. For fair value hedges, the carrying value of the hedged item is also adjusted for changes in fair value for the hedged risk, 
with gains and losses recognised in the income statement. 

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and 
is recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. 

For cash flow hedges, when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. 

For net investment hedges, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement when the foreign 
operation is disposed of.

compared to the amount previously reported. See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ for more information.     

The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally using a mixture of long-term and short-term capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet 
anticipated funding requirements. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity 
to certain subsidiaries.  

Dividends from joint ventures and associates and to non-controlling shareholders 
Dividend policies within shareholder agreements for certain of the Group’s associates and joint ventures give the Group certain rights to receive 
dividends but are generally paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors or shareholders. We do not have existing obligations to pay dividends to 
non-controlling interest partners of our subsidiaries other than ongoing dividend obligations to the Kabel Deutschland A.G. minority shareholders. 
The amount of dividends received and paid in the year are disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 

Potential cash outflows from option agreements and similar arrangements 
All remaining put options issued as part of the hedging strategy for the mandatory convertible bonds (‘MCBs’) matured during the financial year 
(1,452 million share options outstanding as at 31 March 2022). These permitted the holders to exercise against the Group at maturity of the option 
if there was a decrease in our share price. Under the terms of the options, settlement was made in cash which equated to the reduced value of 
shares from the initial conversion price, adjusted for dividends declared. 

Sale of trade receivables  
During the year, the Group sold certain trade receivables to a number of financial institutions. Whilst there are no repurchase obligations in respect 
of these receivables, the Group provided credit guarantees which would only become payable if default rates were significantly higher than 
historical rates. The credit guarantee is not considered substantive and substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to 
the purchaser at the date of sale, therefore the receivables were derecognised. The maximum payable under the guarantees at 31 March 2023 was 
€1,927 million (2022: €1,341 million). No provision has been made in respect of these guarantees as the likelihood of a cash outflow has been 
assessed as remote. 

Supplier financing arrangements 
The Group offers suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain financing (‘SCF’). SCF allows suppliers that decide to use it to receive funding earlier 
than the invoice due date. At 31 March 2023, the financial institutions that run the SCF programmes had purchased €2.4 billion (2022: €2.4 billion) 
of outstanding supplier invoices, principally from larger suppliers. The Group does not provide any financial guarantees to the financial institutions 
under this programme and continues to cash settle supplier payables in accordance with their contractual terms. As such, the programme does not 
change the Group’s net debt, trade payable balances or cash flows. 

The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues to hold the characteristics of a trade 
payable or should be classified as borrowings; these indicators include whether the payment terms exceed the shorter of customary payment terms 
in the industry or 180 days. At 31 March 2023, none of the payables subject to supplier financing arrangements met the criteria to be reclassified as 
borrowings. 

Financial risk management 
The Group’s treasury function centrally manages the Group’s funding requirement, net foreign exchange exposure, interest rate management 
exposures and counterparty risk arising from investments and derivatives. Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and 
guidelines authorised and reviewed by the Board, most recently in March 2023. A treasury risk committee comprising of the Group’s Chief Financial 
Officer, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Group Financial Controller, Group Corporate Finance Director, Group Treasury Director and 
Group Director of Financial Controlling and Operations meets three times a year to review treasury activities and its members receive management 
information relating to treasury activities on a quarterly basis. The Group’s Internal Auditor reviews the internal control environment regularly.

22. Capital and financial risk management (continued)  

No bonds issued by the Group or the Revolving Credit Facilities are subject to financial covenant ratios. Approximately €35 billion (2022: €38 billion) 
of issued bonds have a change of control clause. The Group uses derivative instruments for currency and interest rate risk management purposes that 
are transacted by specialist treasury personnel. The Group mitigates banking sector credit risk by the use of collateral support agreements. 

The Group’s financial risk management policies seek to reduce the Group’s exposure to any future disruption to financial markets, including any 
future impacts from global economic and political uncertainty and other macro economic events. 

The Group has combined cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments of €16.0 billion, providing significant headroom over short-term 
liquidity requirements. Additionally the Group maintains undrawn revolving credit facilities of €7.7 billion euro equivalent. As at 31 March 2023 and 
after hedging, substantially all the Group’s borrowings are held on a fixed interest basis, mitigating exposure to interest rate risk. The Group has no 
significant currency exposures other than positions in economic hedging relationships. The Group’s credit risk under financing activities is spread 
across a portfolio of highly rated institutions to reduce counterparty exposures and derivative balances are substantially all collateralised. The 
Group’s operating activities result in customer credit risk, for which provisions for expected credit losses are recognised.  

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial asset leading to a financial loss for the Group. The Group is 
exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and from its financing activities, the Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 
March to be:

Expected credit loss 
The Group has financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income that are subject to the 
expected credit loss model requirements of IFRS 9. Cash and bank deposits and certain other investments are both classified and measured at 
amortised cost and subject to impairment requirements. However, the identified expected credit loss is considered to be immaterial.  

Information about expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets can be found under ‘operating activities’ on page 179. 

Financing activities 
The Group invests in government securities on the basis they generate a fixed rate of return and are amongst the most creditworthy of investments 
available. 

Investments are made in accordance with established internal treasury policies which dictate the scaled maximum exposure permissible in relation 
to an investment’s long-term credit rating. The Group invests in AAA unsecured money market mutual funds, where the investment is limited to 
10% of each fund; A to AAA government securities, both directly and through money market mutual funds; and has two managed investment funds 
that hold securities with an average credit quality of AA. 

In respect of financial instruments used by the Group’s treasury function, the aggregate credit risk the Group may have with one counterparty is 
limited by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moody’s, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s. Furthermore, 
collateral support agreements reduce the Group’s exposure to counterparties who must post collateral when there is value due to the Group under 
outstanding derivative contracts that exceeds a contractually agreed threshold amount. When value is due to the counterparty the Group is 
required to post collateral on identical terms. Such cash collateral is adjusted daily as necessary.

In addition, as discussed in note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’, the Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of the 
trustee of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme in respect of the funding deficit in the scheme and pledged security in relation to the Indus 
Towers merger. The Group has also pledged cash as collateral against derivative financial instruments as disclosed in note 13 ‘Other investments’. 

Operating activities 
Customer credit risk is managed by the Group’s business units which each have policies, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk 
management. Outstanding trade receivables and contract assets are regularly reviewed to monitor any changes in credit risk with concentrations of 
credit risk considered to be limited given that the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. The Group applies the simplified approach and 
records lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets. Expected credit losses are measured using historical cash 
collection data for periods of at least 24 months wherever possible and grouped into various customer segments based on product or customer 
type. The historical loss rates are adjusted where macroeconomic factors, for example changes in interest rates or unemployment rates, or other 
commercial factors are expected to have a significant impact when determining future expected credit loss rates. For trade receivables the expected 
credit loss provision is calculated using a provision matrix, in which the provision increases as balances age, and for receivables paid in instalments 
and contract assets a weighted loss rate is calculated to reflect the period over which the amounts become due for payment by the customer. Trade 
receivables and contract assets are written off when each business unit determines there to be no reasonable expectation of recovery and 
enforcement activity has ceased. 

Movements in the allowance for expected credit losses during the year were as follows:

22. Capital and financial risk management (continued)  

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity is reviewed daily on at least a 12 month rolling basis and stress tested on the assumption that any commercial paper outstanding matures 
and is not reissued. The Group maintains substantial cash and cash equivalents which at 31 March 2023 amounted to cash €11.7 billion (2022: €7.5 
billion) and undrawn committed facilities of €8.0 billion (2022: €8.2 billion), principally euro and US dollar revolving credit facilities of €4.0 billion 
and US$4.0 billion (€3.7 billion) which mature in 2025 and 2028 respectively. The Group manages liquidity risk on non-current borrowings by 
maintaining a varied maturity profile with a cap on the level of debt maturity in any one calendar year, therefore minimising refinancing risk. Non-
current borrowings mature between 1 and 40 years. 

The maturity profile
undiscounted basis which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:

Interest rate management 
Under the Group’s interest rate management policy, interest rates on long-term monetary assets and liabilities are principally maintained on a fixed 
rate basis. 

At 31 March 2023 and after hedging, substantially all of our outstanding liabilities are held on a fixed interest rate basis in accordance with treasury 
policy. At 31 March 2022 the Group held economic interest rate hedges at fair value through profit and loss. 

For each one hundred basis point rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group had borrowings at 31 March 2023 there would be 
an increase in profit before tax by €27 million (2022: €420 million) including mark to market revaluations of interest rate and other derivatives and 
the potential interest on cash and short-term investments. There would be no material impact on equity. 

At 31 March 2023, the Group had limited exposure through interest rate derivatives and floating rate bonds referencing LIBOR and other interbank 
offered rates (IBORs).    

Foreign exchange management 
As Vodafone’s primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange its share price is quoted in sterling. Since the sterling share price represents the 
value of its future multi-currency cash flows, principally in euro, South African rand and sterling, the Group maintains the currency of debt and 
interest charges in proportion to its expected future principal cash flows and has a policy to hedge external foreign exchange risks on transactions 
denominated in other currencies above a certain de minimis level.  

At 31 March 2023 11% of net debt was denominated in currencies other than euro (3% sterling, 6% South African rand and 2% other). This allows 
sterling, South African rand and other debt to be serviced in proportion to expected future cash flows and therefore provides a partial economic 
hedge against income statement translation exposure, as interest costs will be denominated in foreign currencies.  

Under the Group’s foreign exchange management policy, foreign exchange transaction exposure in Group companies is generally maintained at the 
lower of €5 million per currency per month or €15 million per currency over a six month period.  

The Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances treated as 
investments in foreign operations. However, there is no net impact on equity for exchange rate movements on net investment hedging instruments 
as there would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation. At 31 March 2023 the Group held financial liabilities in a net 
investment hedge against the Group’s South African rand operations. Sensitivity to foreign exchange movements on the hedging liabilities, 
analysed against a strengthening of the South African rand by 12% (2022: 13%) would result in a decrease in equity of €267 million (2022: 
€221million) which would be fully offset by foreign exchange movements on the hedged net assets. In addition, cash flow hedges of principally US 
dollar borrowings would result in an increase in equity of €204 million (2022: €371 million) against a strengthening of US dollar by 5% (2022: 5%).  

The Group profit and loss account is exposed to foreign exchange risk within both operating profit and financing income and expense. The principal 
operations not generating income in euro are Vodacom South Africa (South African rand), and Egypt (Egyptian pound). Financing income and 
expense includes foreign currency gains/losses incurred on the translation of balance sheet items not held in functional currency. These are 
principally on certain borrowings, derivatives, and other investments denominated in sterling and Turkish lira.  

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange risk. The percentage movement applied to the currency is based on the 
average movements in the previous three annual reporting periods.

ZAR 12% change (2022: 13%)

Equity risk 
There is no material equity risk relating to the Group’s equity investments which are detailed in note 13 ‘Other investments’. 

In the prior financial year, the Group had hedged its exposure under the subordinated mandatory convertible bonds to any future movements in its 
share price by an option strategy designed to hedge the economic impact of share price movements. This option strategy ended during the current 
financial year.  As at 31 March 2023, the Group is no longer sensitive (2022: 7% sensitivity) to a movement in its share price that would result in an 
increase or decrease in profit before tax (2022: €36 million).

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 

Risk management strategy of hedge relationships  
The risk strategies of the designated cash flow, fair value, and net investment hedges reflect the above market risk strategies.  

The objective of the cash flow hedges is principally to convert foreign currency denominated fixed rate borrowings in US dollar, pound sterling, 
Australian dollar, Swiss franc, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Norwegian krona and US dollar floating rate borrowings into euro fixed rate 
borrowings and hedge the foreign exchange spot rate and interest rate risk. There are also cash flow hedges of certain subsidiary expenditure not 
denominated in functional currency of the entity, to hedge foreign exchange spot risk. Derivative financial instruments designated in cash flow 
hedges are cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps and forwards. The swap maturity dates and liquidity profiles of the 
nominal cash flows match those of the underlying borrowings and exposures. 

The objective of the net investment hedges is to hedge foreign exchange risk in foreign operations. Derivative financial instruments designated in 
net investment hedges are cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps. The hedging instruments are rolled on an ongoing basis 
as determined by the nature of the business. 

The objective of the fair value hedges is to hedge a proportion of the Group’s fixed rate euro denominated borrowing to a euro floating rate 
borrowing. The swap maturity dates match those of the underlying borrowing and the nominal cash flows are converted to quarterly payments.  

Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure 
that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. 

For hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings and investments, the Group uses a combination of cross-currency and foreign exchange 
swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk and enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the 
hedging instrument match with the terms of the hedged item. Therefore the Group expects a highly effective hedging relationship with the swap 
contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items to change systematically in the opposite direction in response to movements in the 
underlying exchange rates and interest rates. The Group therefore performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness. If changes in circumstances 
affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses 
the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. 

Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to: 

a)  The fair value of the hedging instrument on the hedge relationship designation date if the fair value is not nil; 

b) Changes in the contractual terms or timing of the payments on the hedged item; and 

c)  A change in the credit risk of the Group or the counterparty with the hedging instrument. 

The hedge ratio for each designation will be established by comparing the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item 
to determine their relative weighting; for all of the Group’s existing hedge relationships the hedge ratio has been determined as 1:1. 

The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate 
market rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March. The valuation basis is level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. This classification comprises 
items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly. 
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables in the statement of financial 
position.

Notes: 
1     Fair value movement deferred into other comprehensive income includes €383 million loss (2022: €1,318 million loss) and €17 million gain (2022: €1 million gain) of foreign currency basis outside the 

cash flow and net investment hedge relationships respectively. 

2     Includes euro and US dollar forward contracts against Turkish lira to hedge foreign currency forecast expenditures in local markets. Notional amounts of €259 million (2022: €146 million) and $134 million 

or €124 million equivalent (2022: $109 million or €98 million equivalent) with weighted average exchange rates of 18.36 (2022: 12.45) and 20.07 (2022: 10.95) respectively to Turkish lira. 

3  For cash flow hedges, the movement in the hypothetical derivative (hedged item) mirrors that of the hedging instrument. Hedge ineffectiveness of the swaps designated in a cash flow hedge during the 

period was €nil (2022: €nil). 

4  The carrying value of bonds includes an additional €776 million loss (2022: €760 million loss) in relation to fair value of other bonds previously designated in fair value hedge relationships. 
5  Hedge ineffectiveness of swaps designated in a net investment hedge during the period was €nil (2022: €nil).

Fair value and carrying value information 
The carrying value and valuation basis of the Group’s financial assets are set out in notes 13 ‘Other investments’, 14 ‘Trade and other receivables’ 
and 19 ‘Cash and cash equivalents’. For all financial assets held at amortised cost the carrying values approximate fair value except as disclosed in 
note 13 ‘Other investments’. 

The carrying value and valuation basis of the Group’s financial liabilities are set out in notes 15 ‘Trade and other payables’ and 21 ‘Borrowings’. The 
carrying values approximate fair value for the Group’s trade payables and other payables categories. For other financial liabilities a comparison of fair 
value and carrying value is disclosed in note 21 ‘Borrowings’. 

Level 3 financial instruments 
The Group’s borrowings include €1,485 million (2022: €1,382 million) of bank borrowings that are secured against the Group’s shareholdings in 
Indus Towers and Vodafone Idea (see note 12 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ for further details of these assets) and will be repaid 
through the realisation of proceeds from those assets. This arrangement contains an embedded derivative option which has been separately fair 
valued. The 31 March 2023 valuation of the embedded derivative asset of €198 million (2022: €3 million) is presented within derivative assets in 
current assets (see note 14 ‘Trade and other receivables’).  

A Black Scholes model for European put options has been used as a valuation model and primarily uses market inputs (quoted share prices and 
volatilities for Indus Towers and Vodafone Idea) along with a strike price equal to the amount payable under the loan. The valuation includes an 
unobservable adjustment to reflect the potential timeframe to settle the loan and has been modelled using a range of potential durations up to 30 
September 2024. As a result of this unobservable adjustment, the option is classified as a level 3 instrument under the fair value hierarchy. An 
increase/(decrease) in durations applied of 6 months would increase/(decrease) the derivative asset by €141 million/(€115 million). 

Net financial instruments 
The table below shows the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are subject to offset in the balance sheet and the impact of enforceable 
master netting or similar agreements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 

25. Post employment benefits 

The Group operates a number of Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution retirement plans for our employees. The 
Group’s largest defined benefit plan is in the UK. For further details see ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’.    

Accounting policies 
For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is 
recognised as an asset or a liability on the consolidated statement of financial position. Defined benefit plan liabilities are assessed using the 
projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value. 

Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for defined benefit plans or consolidated income 
statement for cash leaver plans as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial 
assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The 
return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive 
income. 

Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the consolidated income statement, including the current service cost, any past 
service cost and the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the consolidated 
income statement. The amount charged to the consolidated income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the 
Group’s share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate. 

The Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the consolidated income statement as they fall due. 

Background 
At 31 March 2023 the Group operated a number of retirement plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and 
obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group’s philosophy is to provide access to defined 
contribution retirement plans where feasible and to manage legacy defined benefit retirement arrangements. Defined benefit plans provide 
benefits based on the employees’ length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution plans offer 
employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement. 

The Group operates defined benefit plans in Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States; defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and 
Turkey; and a cash leaver plan in India. Defined contribution plans are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, 
South Africa, Spain and the UK.

Defined benefit plans 
The Group’s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that 
location. The Group’s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution arrangements and/or State provision for future service. 

The Group’s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). Since June 2014 the Vodafone 
UK plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (‘CWW Section’). Both sections are closed 
to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in 
Germany and a funded plan in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity 
of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value 
of assets of the plans. 

The main defined benefit plans are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are 
employees, former employees or are independent from the Group. The trustee boards of the pension plans are required by legislation to act in the 
best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding regimes. 

The Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) and is subject to UK legislation and 
operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension plans are funded prudently and that 
valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section. 

The trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to 
restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. The 31 March 2022 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW 
Section of the Vodafone UK plan showed a net surplus of £248 million (€282 million) on the funding basis, comprising of a £97 million (€110 
million) surplus for the Vodafone Section and a £151 million (€172 million) surplus for the CWW Section. No further contributions are due in respect 
of the Vodafone UK plan at this time.  The next actuarial valuation has an effective date of 31 March 2025.

Other information

These plan-specific actuarial valuations differ to the IAS 19 accounting basis, which is used to measure pension assets and liabilities presented in the 
Group’s consolidated statement of financial position. 

Funding plans are individually agreed for each of the Group’s other defined benefit plans with the respective trustees or governing board, taking into 
account local regulatory requirements. It is expected that ordinary contributions of €71 million will be paid into the Group’s defined benefit plans 
during the year ending 31 March 2024. The Group has also provided certain guarantees in respect of the Vodafone UK plan; further details are 
provided in note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ to the consolidated financial statements. 

The investment strategy for the UK plans is controlled by the trustees in consultation with the Group and the plans have no direct investments in 
the Group’s equity securities or in property or other assets currently used by the Group. The allocation of assets between different classes of 
investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the trustee investment policy. The trustees aim to achieve the plan’s investment objectives 
through investing partly in a diversified mix of growth assets which, over the long term, are expected to grow in value by more than the low risk 
assets. The low risk assets include cash and gilts, inflation and interest rate hedging and in substance insured pensioner annuity policies in both the 
Vodafone Section and CWW Sections of the Vodafone UK plan and an insured pensioner annuity policy in the Vodafone Ireland Pension Plan. A 
number of investment managers are appointed to promote diversification by assets, organisation and investment style and current market 
conditions and trends are regularly assessed, which may lead to adjustments in the asset allocation. 

During the reporting period, there were significant movements in UK gilt markets – in particular the ‘mini budget’ announced by the UK 
government on 23 September 2022 caused rapid sales of government bonds which further depressed gilt markets. Although a temporary 
intervention by the Bank of England and subsequent policy changes stabilised the market, gilt yields increased significantly in a short period 
of time.  This triggered an increase in collateral calls for pension schemes that, like the Vodafone UK plan, used liability driven investment 
(LDI) strategies to hedge their interest rate risks. 

In response to the risk of potential future collateral calls, on 18 October 2022, the Group entered into short term liquidity facilities with both 
sections of the Vodafone UK plan for an aggregate amount of £450 million (€512 million). These facilities were put in place for short-term 
liquidity purposes, with the intention of reducing the risk should the UK plan be required to dispose of assets at short notice in the event of 
significant increases in gilt yields. Drawings could be made from the facility until 27 January 2023, with all amounts borrowed required to be 
repaid by 28 February 2023. No amounts were drawn under these facilities. 

There has been reduced volatility in gilt yields since the end of 2022, although, the level of yields are significantly higher than they were at 31 
March 2022. This has resulted in a decrease in the value of the assets, and also liabilities in respect of the Vodafone UK plan as at 31 March 
2023.

Mortality assumptions used are based on recommendations from the individual local actuaries which include adjustments for the experience of the 
Group where appropriate. The Group’s largest plan is the Vodafone UK plan. Further life expectancies assumed for the UK plans are 22.8/24.7 years 
(2022: 23.4/25.4 years) for a male/female pensioner currently aged 65 years and 23.7/25.5 years (2022: 25.4/27.5 years) from age 65 for a 
male/female non-pensioner member currently aged 40. 

Charges made to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income (‘SOCI’) on the basis of the 
assumptions stated above are:

Note: 
1  Derivatives include collateral held in the form of cash. Assets are valued using ‘level 2’ inputs under IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ principles and classified as unquoted accordingly. 

The fair value of plan assets, which have been measured in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’, are analysed by asset category above 
and are subdivided by assets that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that do not, such as investment funds. Where available, 
the fair values are quoted prices (e.g. listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds). Unlisted investments without quoted prices in an active 
market (e.g. private equity) are included at values provided by the fund manager in accordance with relevant guidance. Other significant assets are 
valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves. The Vodafone UK plan annuity policies fully match the pension obligations of those 
pensioners insured and therefore are set equal to the present value of the related obligations. Investment funds of €782 million at 31 March 2023 
(2022: €1,161 million) include investments in diversified alternative beta funds held in the Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK plan. 

The actual return on plan assets over the year to 31 March 2023 was a loss of €2,290 million (2022: €198 million gain). 

Sensitivity analysis 
Measurement of the Group’s defined benefit retirement obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions. The sensitivity analysis below 
shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2023.

presenting this sensitivity analysis, the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated on the same basis as prior years using the projected unit credit 
method at the end of the year, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position. The rate of inflation 
assumption sensitivity factors in the impact of changes to all assumptions relating to inflation including the rate of increase in salaries, pension increases and deferred revaluations.

26. Share-based payments 

The Group has a number of share plans used to award shares to Executive Directors and employees as part of their 
remuneration package. A charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record 
the cost of these, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. 

Accounting policies 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based awards to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based awards are measured at fair value (excluding 
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-
based award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and 
adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. A corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital is also recognised. 

Some share awards have an attached market condition, based on total shareholder return (‘TSR’), which is taken into account when calculating 
the fair value of the share awards. The valuation for the TSR is based on Vodafone’s ranking within the same group of companies, where possible, 
over the past five years. 

The fair value of awards of non-vested shares is a calculation of the closing price of the Company’s shares on the day prior to the grant date, adjusted 
for the present value of the delay in receiving dividends where appropriate. 

The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued in respect of share options or share plans will not (without shareholder 
approval) exceed: 
− 

10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of 
ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans; and 

− 

5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of 
ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans, other than any plans which are operated  
on an all-employee basis. 

Share options 
Vodafone Sharesave Plan 
Under the Vodafone Sharesave Plan UK staff may acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings of up to £375 over a three and/or five 
year period. The savings may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the invitation period and usually at 
a discount of 20% to the then prevailing market price of the Company’s shares. 

Share plans 
Vodafone Group executive plans 
Under the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to Directors and certain employees. The release of these shares is 
conditional upon continued employment and for some awards achievement of certain performance targets measured over a three year period. 

Vodafone Share Incentive Plan 
Following a review of the UK all-employee plans it was decided that with effect from 1 April 2017 employees would no longer be able to contribute 
to the Share Incentive Plan and would therefore no longer receive matching shares. Individuals who continue to hold shares in the plan will receive 
dividends paid out in cash.

27. Acquisitions and disposals 

The note below provides details of acquisition and disposal transactions for the current year as well as those completed in the 
prior year. For further details see ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of 
preparation’ to the consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting policies  
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at 
the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. Acquisition-related costs are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition 
date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the 
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the 
net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the 
acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders’ proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets 
acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. 

Acquisition of interests from non-controlling shareholders 
In transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change in control, the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid or 
received and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity.  

Disposals 
The difference between the carrying value of the net assets disposed of and the fair value of consideration received is recorded as a gain or loss on 
disposal. Foreign exchange translation gains or losses relating to subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates that the Group has disposed of, and that 
have previously recorded in other comprehensive income or expense, are also recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 

Other transactions with non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries

28. Commitments 

A commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future, mainly in relation to agreements to buy assets such 
as mobile devices, network infrastructure and IT systems and leases that have not commenced. These amounts are not 
recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position since we have not yet received the goods or services from the 
supplier.

Leases entered into by the Group but not commenced at 31 March 2023 are disclosed in note 20 ‘Leases’. Included in capital commitments is an 
amount of €114 million (2022: €331 million) relating to spectrum acquisition commitments in Vodacom. 

In March 2023, the Group entered into an agreement with Altice Luxembourg S.A. to create a joint venture, OXG Glasfaser GmbH ‘OXG’, with 50.0% 
shareholding held by each shareholder. Each shareholder is committed to contribute funding of up to €950 million to OXG for the deployment of 
fibre-to-the-home in Germany.  The funding is expected to be contributed between 2023 and 2029.  The amount and timing of the funding depends 
on the speed and size of the fibre deployment so the funding may be for a lower value or contributed over a longer period of time. The contribution 
can be in the form of free capital reserves, shareholder loan, loan notes or similar instruments as agreed by the shareholders. 

29. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 

Contingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows, where the likelihood of payment is considered more than remote, but 
is not considered probable or cannot be measured reliably.

UK pension schemes 
The Group’s main defined benefit plan is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’) which has two segregated sections, the 
Vodafone Section and the CWW Section, as detailed in note 25 ‘Post employment benefits’. 

The Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of both the Vodafone Section and CWW Section when they are in a deficit position. The deficit is 
measured on a prescribed basis agreed between the Group and trustee, which differs from the accounting basis reported in note 25 ‘Post employment 
benefits’. The Group provides surety bonds as the security. 

The level of the security has varied since inception in line with the movement in the Vodafone UK plan deficit. Due to the improved funding position of 
the Plan the level of security has reduced over the year. As at 31 March 2023 the Vodafone UK plan retains security over €114 million (notional value) for 
the Vodafone Section and no security is currently required for the CWW Section. The security may be substituted either on a voluntary or mandatory 
basis. The Company has also provided two guarantees to the Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK plan for a combined value up to €1.42 billion to 
provide security over the deficit under certain defined circumstances, including insolvency of the employers. The Company has also agreed a similar 
guarantee of up to €1.42 billion for the CWW Section.

An additional smaller UK defined benefit plan, the THUS Plc Group Scheme, has a guarantee from the Company for up to €114 million. 

Vodafone Idea 
As part of the agreement to merge Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in 2017, the parties agreed a mechanism for payments between the Group and 
Vodafone Idea Limited (‘VIL’) pursuant to the difference between the crystallisation of certain identified contingent liabilities in relation to legal, 
regulatory, tax and other matters, and refunds relating to Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. Cash payments or cash receipts relating to these matters 
must have been made or received by VIL before any amount becomes due from or owed to the Group. Any future payments by the Group to VIL as a 
result of this agreement would only be made after satisfaction of this and other contractual conditions.  

The Group’s potential exposure under this mechanism is capped at INR 64 billion (€719 million) following payments made under this mechanism from 
Vodafone to VIL, in the year ended 31 March 2021, totalling INR 19 billion (€235 million).  

On 7 February 2023, VIL issued equity to the Government of India equivalent to INR 161 billion (€1.8 billion), representing the net present value of 
interest accrued on both deferred spectrum auction instalments and AGR dues pursuant to a relief package announced in September 2021 which is 
designed to improve the liquidity and financial health of the telecom sector.  Wider reforms announced as part of the relief package include a four-year 
moratorium on spectrum and AGR payments and the option to convert payments due on spectrum and AGR payments to equity at the end of the 
moratorium period which VIL elected to accept in October 2021. 

VIL remains in need of additional liquidity support from its lenders and intends to raise additional funding. There are significant uncertainties in relation to 
VIL’s ability to make payments in relation to any remaining liabilities covered by the mechanism and no further cash payments are considered probable 
from the Group as at 31 March 2023.  The carrying value of the Group’s investment in VIL is €nil and the Group is recording no further share of losses in 
respect of VIL. The Group’s potential exposure to liabilities within VIL is capped by the mechanism described above; consequently, contingent liabilities 
arising from litigation in India concerning operations of Vodafone India are not reported. 

Indus Towers 
VIL’s ability to satisfy certain payment obligations under its Master Services Agreements with Indus Towers (the ‘MSAs’) is uncertain and depends on a 
number of factors including its ability to raise additional funding.  Under the terms of the Indus and Bharti Infratel merger in November 2020, a security 
package was agreed for the benefit of the newly created merged entity, Indus Towers, which could be invoked in the event that VIL was unable to make 
MSA payments. The security package included the following elements: 

-

-

-

A cash prepayment of INR 24 billion (€279 million) by VIL to Indus Towers in respect of its undisputed payment obligations, due under the MSAs 
after the merger closing. The prepayment was fully utilised during the year to 31 March 2022; 

A primary pledge over 190.7 million shares owned by Vodafone Group in Indus Towers having a value of INR 47 billion (€544 million) as at 31 March 
2021.  These pledged shares were sold by the Group in the year ended 31 March 2022; the Group invested INR 33.7 billion (€393 million) of the 
proceeds by subscribing to newly issued VIL equity, which VIL immediately used to partially settle outstanding MSA obligations to Indus Towers 
resulting in an equivalent partial release of the primary pledge.  On 14 February 2023, a similar transaction was undertaken with INR 4.4 billion (€49 
million) remaining from the sale of the primary pledge shares, fully releasing the pledge.   

A secondary pledge over shares owned by Vodafone Group in Indus Towers, ranking behind Vodafone’s existing lenders for the outstanding bank 
borrowings of €1.5 billion as at 31 March 2023 secured against Indian assets (‘the bank borrowings’), with a maximum liability cap of INR 42.5 billion 
(€476 million).  In the event of non-payment of relevant MSA obligations by VIL, Indus Towers would have recourse to any secondary pledged 
shares, after repayment of the bank borrowings in full, up to the value of the liability cap.

29. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings (continued)  

Legal Proceedings 
The Group is currently involved in a number of legal proceedings, including inquiries from, or discussions with, government authorities that are 
incidental to its operations. 

Legal proceedings where the Group considers that the likelihood of material future outflows of cash or other resources is more than remote are 
disclosed below. Where the Group assesses that it is probable that the outcome of legal proceedings will result in a financial outflow, and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of that obligation, a provision is recognised for these amounts.  

In all cases, determining the probability of successfully defending a claim against the Group involves the application of judgement as the outcome 
is inherently uncertain. The determination of the value of any future outflows of cash or other resources, and the timing of such outflows, involves 
the use of estimates. The costs incurred in complex legal proceedings, regardless of outcome, can be significant. 

The Group is not involved in any material proceedings in which any of the Group’s Directors, members of senior management or affiliates are either a 
party adverse to the Group or have a material interest adverse to the Group. 

Indian tax cases  
The Group has been challenging retrospective tax demands raised by the Indian tax authority under the Finance Act 2012 against Vodafone 
International Holdings BV (‘VIHBV’) relating to a transaction in 2007 whereby VIHBV acquired assets in India from Hutchison Telecommunications 
International Limited.  Pursuant to a new scheme for resolving tax disputes introduced by legislation in August 2021, Vodafone and the Indian 
Government have reached a final agreement and the demands for outstanding tax (including interest and penalties) have been withdrawn in full.  

Further background relating to this matter is provided in the Group’s Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 March 2022.  

VISPL tax claims  
Vodafone India Services Private Ltd (‘VISPL’) is involved in a number of tax cases. The total value of the claims is approximately €471 million plus 
interest, and penalties of up to 300% of the principal. 

Of the individual tax claims, the most significant is in the amount of approximately €239 million (plus interest of €628 million), which VISPL has 
been assessed as owing in respect of (i) a transfer pricing margin charged for the international call centre of HTIL prior to the 2007 transaction with 
Vodafone for HTIL assets in India; (ii) the sale of the international call centre by VISPL to HTIL; and (iii) the acquisition of and/or the alleged transfer 
of options held by VISPL in Vodafone India. The first two of the three heads of tax are subject to an indemnity by HTIL. The larger part of the potential 
claim is not subject to an indemnity. A stay of the tax demand on a deposit of £20 million and a corporate guarantee by VIHBV for the balance of tax 
assessed are in place. On 8 October 2015, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Vodafone in relation to the options and the call centre sale. The 
Indian Tax Authority has appealed to the Supreme Court of India. The appeal hearing has been adjourned indefinitely.  

While there is some uncertainty as to the outcome of the tax cases involving VISPL, the Group believes it has valid defences and does not consider it 
probable that a financial outflow will be required to settle these cases. 

Netherlands tax case 
Vodafone Europe BV (‘VEBV’) has received assessments totalling €267 million of tax and interest from the Dutch tax authorities, who are challenging 
the application of the arm’s length principle in relation to various intra-group financing transactions. VEBV has appealed against these assessments 
to the District Court of the Hague where a hearing was held in March 2023 and we are awaiting the decision which is currently expected in summer 
2023. The Group has entered into a guarantee for the full value of the assessments issued.  

The Group believes it has robust defences and does not consider it probable that there will be a financial outflow required to resolve the case.

Other cases in the Group 

Germany: Kabel Deutschland takeover - class actions  
The German courts have been determining the adequacy of the mandatory cash offer made to minority shareholders in Vodafone’s takeover of 
Kabel Deutschland in 2013. Hearings took place in May 2019 and a decision was delivered in November 2019 in Vodafone’s favour, rejecting all 
claims by minority shareholders. A number of shareholders appealed which was rejected by the court in December 2021. Several minority 
shareholders have filed a further appeal before the Federal Court of Justice. The appeal process is ongoing.  While the outcome is uncertain, the 
Group believes it has valid defences and that the outcome of the appeal will be favourable to Vodafone. 

Italy: Iliad v Vodafone Italy  
In July 2019, Iliad filed a claim for €500 million against Vodafone Italy in the Civil Court of Milan. The claim alleges anti-competitive behaviour in 
relation to portability and certain advertising campaigns by Vodafone Italy. The main hearing on the merits of the claim took place on 8 June 2021. 
On 17 April 2023, the Civil Court issued a judgement in Vodafone Italy’s favour and rejected Iliad’s claim for damages in full. Whether Iliad will appeal 
the judgement is unknown as of the date of this report. 

The Group is currently unable to estimate any possible loss in this claim in the event of an adverse judgement on appeal but while the outcome is 
uncertain, the Group believes it has valid defences and that it is probable that no present obligation exists.  

Greece: Papistas Holdings SA, Mobile Trade Stores (formerly Papistas SA) and Athanasios and Loukia Papistas v Vodafone Greece 
In October 2019, Mr. and Mrs. Papistas, and companies owned or controlled by them, filed several claims against Vodafone Greece with a total value 
of approximately €330 million for purported damage caused by the alleged abuse of dominance and wrongful termination of a franchise 
arrangement with a Papistas company. Lawsuits which the Papistas claimants had previously brought against Vodafone Group Plc and certain 
directors and officers of Vodafone were withdrawn. Vodafone Greece filed a counter claim and all claims were heard in February 2020. All of the 
Papistas claims were rejected by the Athens Court of First Instance because the stamp duty payments required to have the merits of the case 
considered had not been made.  Vodafone Greece’s counter claim was also rejected. The Papistas claimants and Vodafone Greece have each filed 
appeals. The appeal hearings took place on 23 February and 11 May 2023 and we are waiting to receive the judgements.   

The amount claimed in these lawsuits is substantial and, if the claimants are successful, the total potential liability could be material. However, we 
are continuing vigorously to defend the claims and based on the progress of the litigation so far the Group believes that it is highly unlikely that 
there will be an adverse ruling for the Group. On this basis, the Group does not expect the outcome of these claims to have a material financial 
impact.   

UK: Phones 4U in Administration v Vodafone Limited and Vodafone Group Plc and Others  
In December 2018, the administrators of former UK indirect seller, Phones 4U, sued the three main UK mobile network operators (‘MNOs’), 
including Vodafone, and their parent companies in the English High Court. The administrators allege collusion between the MNOs to pull their 
business from Phones 4U, thereby causing its collapse. Vodafone and the other defendants filed their defences in April 2019 and the Administrators 
filed their replies in October 2019.  Disclosure has taken place and witness statements were filed in December 2021. The judge has also ordered that 
there should be a split trial between liability and damages. The first trial on liability took place from May to July 2022. We are waiting to receive the 
judgement. 

Taking into account all available evidence, the Group assesses it to be more likely than not that a present obligation does not exist and that the 
allegations of collusion are completely without merit; the Group is vigorously defending the claim. The value of the claim is not pleaded but we 
understand it to be the total value of the business, allegedly equivalent to approximately £1 billion with the addition of alleged exemplary damages. 
Vodafone’s alleged share of the liability is also not pleaded.  The Group is not able to estimate any possible loss in the event of an adverse judgment.

M-Pesa Holding Company Limited 
On 17 April 2023, the Group entered into an agreement to sell M-Pesa Holding Company Limited (‘MPHCL’) to Safaricom Plc, an associate entity of the Group, 
for USD 1. MPHCL holds M-Pesa customer funds on trust for the benefit of M-Pesa customers in Kenya.  Balances included in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements for MPHCL at 31 March 2023 include short term investments of €1,247 million and €1,226 million due to M-Pesa customers, recorded 
within Other investments and Other creditors, respectively. These sums are shown in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS,

on trust for the benefit of M-Pesa customers. Any profit generated by MPHCL, after defraying direct costs, is donated for use for public charitable purposes 
only. See note 13 ‘Other investments’ and note 15 ‘Trade and other payables’. No material gain or loss is expected to arise on disposal. Completion of this 
transaction is subject to various approvals which are expected to be obtained before or during July 2023.

Notes:  
1     These reserves are not distributable.  
2     Own shares relate to treasury shares which are purchased out of distributable profits and therefore reduce reserves available for distribution.  
3     The Company has determined what amounts within this reserve are distributable and non-distributable in accordance with the guidance provided by ICAEW TECH 02/17BL and the requirements of 
UK law. In accordance with UK Companies Act 2006 s831(2), a public company may make a distribution only if, after giving effect to such distribution, the amount of its net assets is not less than the 
aggregate of its’ called up share capital and non-distributable reserves.

4     Movements include the re-issue of 1,519 million shares (€1,903 million) in March 2022 to satisfy the second tranche of the Mandatory Convertible Bond issued in March 2019. 
5     Represents the irrevocable and non-discretionary share buyback programmes announced on 16 November 2022 (2022: Announced on 19 May 2021, 23 July 2021, 17 November 2021 and 9 

March 2022).  

6     Includes the impact of the Company’s cash flow hedges with €2,356 million net gain deferred to other comprehensive income during the year (2022: €3,632 million net gain), €895 million net gain 

(2022: €1,419 million net gain) recycled to the income statement, and a tax charge of €365 million (2022: €501 million). These hedges primarily relate to foreign exchange exposure on fixed 
borrowings, with any foreign exchange on nominal balances directly impacting income statement in each period but interest cash flows unwinding to the income statement over the life of the 
hedges (up to 2063). See note 22 ‘Capital and financial risk management’ to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Notes to the Company financial statements 

1. Basis of preparation 

The separate financial statements of the Company are drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 
‘Reduced disclosure framework’, (‘FRS 101’). The Company will continue to prepare its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 on an 
ongoing basis until such time as it notifies shareholders of any change to its chosen accounting framework.  

The Company financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and 
financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.  

The following exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied: 
− 

Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, ‘Shared-based payment’ (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of share options, 
and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined); 

− 
− 

− 
− 

− 
− 

− 

− 

IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’; 

Paragraph 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets 
and liabilities); 

Paragraph 38 of IAS 1  ‘Presentation of financial statements’ comparative information requirements in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1; 

The following paragraphs of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’: 

− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 

10(d) (statement of cash flows); 

16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS); 

38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements); 

38B-D (additional comparative information); 

40A-D (requirements for a third statement of financial position); 

111 (cash flow statement information); and 

134-136 (capital management disclosures). 

IAS 7 ‘Statement of cash flows’; 

Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’ (requirement for the disclosure of information 
when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective);  

The requirements in IAS 24 ‘Related party disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a 
group; 

The requirements in IAS 36 ‘Impairment of asset’ to disclose valuation technique and assumptions used in determining recoverable amount. 

As permitted by section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Company is not presented in this Annual Report. 
These separate financial statements are not intended to give a true and fair view of the profit or loss or cash flows of the Company. The Company 
has not published its individual cash flow statement as its liquidity, solvency and financial adaptability are dependent on the Group rather than its 
own cash flows.  

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of Company financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Management regularly reviews the accounting judgements and critical estimates that could potentially significantly impact the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements and give rise to material adjustments in the Company’s financial statements.  

A source of estimation uncertainty for the Company relates to the review for impairment of investment carrying values and the estimates used 
when determining the recoverable value of the investment. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment from 
revisions to these assumptions within the next financial year (see note 2 ‘Fixed assets’).

Notes to the Company financial statements (continued) 

1. Basis of preparation (continued)  

Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as a whole  
Foreign currencies  
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional rate of currency prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the Company’s functional currency at the rates prevailing on the reporting 
period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the initial 
transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences arising 
on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement for the period. Exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the period. 

Borrowing costs 
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 

Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date. 

Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences that exist at the reporting period date and that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a 
right to pay less tax in the future. The deferred tax is measured at the rate expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are 
expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting period date. Temporary differences 
arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in 
the Company financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be 
recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 

Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Company statement of financial position when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 

Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The 
accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below. 

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Company’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative 
financial instruments. 

The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles 
on the use of derivative financial instruments consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. Changes in values of all derivative financial 
instruments are included within the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship when changes in value are 
deferred to other comprehensive income or equity respectively. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes. 

Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each 
reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (‘fair value 
hedges’) or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments (‘cash flow 
hedges’). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. 

Fair value hedges 
The Company’s policy is to use derivative financial instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating 
rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk arising, principally, from capital market borrowings. The Company designates these as fair value hedges 
of interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the 
changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. Gains and losses relating to any ineffective 
portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.

2. Fixed assets 

Cash flow hedges 
Cash flow hedging is used by the Company to hedge certain exposures to variability in future cash flows. The portion of gains or losses relating to 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income; 
gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-
financial liability. When the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain 
or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the hedged 
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated 
in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement. 

New accounting pronouncements 
To the extent applicable the Company will adopt new accounting policies as set out in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ in the consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting policies 
Shares in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and capital related to share-based payments. Contributions in 
respect of share-based payments are recognised in line with the policy set out in note 7 ‘Share-based payments’. 

The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment 
may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 

Where there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 

The Company applies the same methodology and assumptions used by the Group for goodwill impairment testing purposes, as set out in note 4 
‘Impairment losses’ to the consolidated financial statements. For the purposes of the Company’s own impairment assessment, the Group’s 
operations are considered to be a single cash generating unit (‘CGU’) held within the Company’s principal subsidiary, Vodafone European 
Investments. The pooling of the Company’s interests within a single CGU significantly reduces the risk that movements in individual assumptions 
used during the goodwill impairment testing will impact the result of the investment impairment assessment. Whilst the underlying assumptions 
used are a source of estimation uncertainty, they do not give rise to a significant risk of adjustment within the next financial year.

3. Debtors 

Accounting policies 
Amounts owed by subsidiaries are classified and recorded at amortised cost and reduced by allowances for expected credit losses. Estimated future 
credit losses are first recorded on initial recognition of a receivable and are based on estimated probability of default. Individual balances are written 
off when management deems them not to be collectible. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit and loss.

Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception) and are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated fair value hedge 
relationship. Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is 
recognised over the term of the borrowing.

7. Share-based payments 

Accounting policies 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans for the employees of subsidiaries using the Company’s equity 
instruments. The fair value of the compensation given in respect of these share-based payment plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the 
Company’s subsidiaries over the vesting period. The capital contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiaries in respect of these 
share-based payments. 

The Company currently uses a number of equity-settled share plans to grant options and shares to the Directors and employees of its subsidiaries. 

At 31 March 2023, the Company had 62 million ordinary share options outstanding (2022: 61 million). 

The Company has made capital contributions to its subsidiaries in relation to share-based payments. At 31 March 2023, the cumulative capital 
contribution net of payments received from subsidiaries was €261 million (2022: €239 million). During the year ended 31 March 2023, the total 
capital contribution arising from share-based payments was €135 million (2022: €119 million), with payments of €113 million (2022: €98 million) 
received from subsidiaries.  

Full details of share-based payments, share option schemes and share plans are disclosed in note 26 ‘Share-based payments’ to the consolidated 
financial statements. 

8. Reserves 

The Board is responsible for the Group’s capital management including the approval of dividends. This includes an assessment of both the level of 
reserves legally available for distribution and consideration as to whether the Company would be solvent and retain sufficient liquidity following any 
proposed distribution. 

As Vodafone Group Plc is a group holding company with no direct operations, its ability to make shareholder distributions is dependent on its ability 
to receive funds for such purposes from its subsidiaries in a manner which creates profits available for distribution for the Company. The major 
factors that impact the ability of the Company to access profits held in subsidiary companies at an appropriate level to fulfil its needs for 
distributable reserves on an ongoing basis include: 
− 

the absolute size of the profit pools either currently available for distribution or capable of realisation into distributable reserves in the relevant 
entities; 

− 

the location of these entities in the Group’s corporate structure; 

− 

profit and cash flow generation in those entities; and 

− 

the risk of adverse changes in business valuations giving rise to investment impairment charges, reducing profits available for distribution. 

The Group’s consolidated reserves set out on page 125 do not reflect the profits available for distribution in the Group.

Performance metrics 

Non-GAAP measure 
Adjusted EBITDAaL 

  Purpose 
  Adjusted EBITDAaL is used in conjunction with 
financial measures such as operating profit to assess 
our operating performance and profitability.  
  It is a key external metric used by the investor 
community to assess performance of our operations.  
It is our segment performance measure in accordance 
with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments).  

  Definition 
  Adjusted EBITDAaL is operating profit after 
depreciation on lease-related right of use assets and 
interest on lease liabilities but excluding depreciation, 
amortisation and gains/losses on disposal of owned 
assets and excluding share of results of equity 
accounted associates and joint ventures, impairment 
losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete 
restructuring plans, other income and expense and 
significant items that are not considered by 
management to be reflective of the underlying 
performance of the Group. 

Adjusted EBITDAaL margin is Adjusted EBITDAaL divided by Revenue.  

Organic growth 
All amounts marked with an ‘*’ in this document represent organic growth which presents performance on a comparable basis, excluding the 
impact of foreign exchange rates, mergers and acquisitions, the hyperinflation adjustments in Turkey and other adjustments to improve the 
comparability of results between periods.

Vodafone Business service revenue; and

Financial services revenue in South Africa. 

Whilst organic growth is not intended to be a substitute for reported growth, nor is it superior to reported growth, we believe that the measure 
provides useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons:    
− 

It provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of certain factors unrelated to its operating 
performance; 

It is used for internal performance analysis; and 

− 
− 

It facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies (although the term ‘organic’ is not a defined term under GAAP and may not, 
therefore, be comparable with similarly-titled measures reported by other companies). 

We have not provided a comparative in respect of organic growth rates as the current rates describe the change between the beginning and end of 
the current period, with such changes being explained by the commentary in this document. If comparatives were provided, significant sections of 
the commentary for prior periods would also need to be included, reducing the usefulness and transparency of this document.

Organic growth in retail service revenue in Germany, a non-GAAP metric, is no longer reported. Other performance metrics are considered more relevant for performance commentary.  
This is a new non-GAAP measure for FY23 and has been included because of the hyperinflationary environment in Turkey.

  Purpose 
This metric is used in the calculation of adjusted basic 
earnings per share. 

Adjusted basic earnings per

excludes restructuring costs arising from discrete 
restructuring plans, amortisation of customer bases 
and brand intangible assets, impairment losses, other 
income and expense and mark-to-market and foreign 
exchange movements, together with related tax 
effects.  
Adjusted basic earnings per share is Adjusted profit 
attributable to owners of the parent divided by the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding. This 
is the same denominator used when calculating basic 
earnings per share. 

Adjusted EBITDAaL and Adjusted profit attributable to owners of the parent 
The table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDAaL and Adjusted profit attributable to owners of the parent to their closest equivalent GAAP measures, 
being Operating profit and Profit attributable to owners of the parent, respectively.

Return on Capital Employed 

Non-GAAP measure 
Return on Capital 
Employed ('ROCE') 

  Purpose 
  ROCE is a metric used by the investor community and 
reflects how efficiently we are generating profit with 
the capital we deploy.   

Pre-tax ROCE (controlled) 

  As above. 

Post-tax ROCE (controlled 
and associates/joint 
ventures) 

  Definition 
  We calculate ROCE by dividing Operating profit by the 
average of capital employed as reported in the 
consolidated statement of financial position. Capital 
employed includes borrowings, cash and cash 
equivalents, derivative financial instruments included 
in trade and other receivables/payables, short term 
investments, collateral assets, financial liabilities under 
put option arrangements and equity.  
  We calculate pre-tax ROCE (controlled) by dividing 
Operating profit excluding interest on lease liabilities, 
restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring 
plans, impairment losses, other income and expense, 
the impact of hyperinflationary adjustments in Turkey 
and the share of results of equity accounted associates 
and joint ventures. On a post-tax basis, the measure 
includes our adjusted share of results from associates 
and joint ventures and a notional tax charge. Capital is 
equivalent to net operating assets and is calculated as 
the average of opening and closing balances of: 
property, plant and equipment (including leased assets 
and lease liabilities), intangible assets (including 
goodwill), operating working capital (including held for 
sale assets and excluding derivative balances) and 
provisions, excluding the impact of hyper-inflationary 
adjustments in Turkey and significant impacts 
resulting from business combinations and disposals. 
Other assets that do not directly contribute to returns 
are excluded from this measure and include other 
investments, current and deferred tax balances and 
post employment benefits. On a post-tax basis, ROCE 
also includes our investments in associates and joint 
ventures.

The results for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that Indus Towers Limited is no longer reported as held for sale. This has resulted in an increase of €149 
million in operating profit and an increase of €96 million in capital employed at the end of the year. Consequently, ROCE using GAAP measures has increased by 0.2pps from 5.0% to 5.2% 
compared to amounts previously reported. See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ in the consolidated financial statements for more information.  
Operating profit includes Other income, which includes merger and acquisition activity that is non-recurring in nature. The results for the year ended 31 March 2023 include a gain on disposal 
of Vantage Towers A.G. of €8,607 million, a gain on disposal of Vodafone Ghana of €689 million and a loss on disposal of Vodafone Hungary of €69 million.

The results for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that Indus Towers Limited is no longer reported as held for sale. This has resulted in an increase of €128 
million in adjusted operating profit for calculating post-tax ROCE (controlled and associates/joint ventures) and an increase of €96 million in adjusted capital employed for calculating post-
tax ROCE (controlled and associate/joint ventures).  Consequently, post-tax ROCE (controlled and associates/joint ventures) has increased by 0.2pps from 5.0% to 5.2% compared to 
amounts previously reported. There is no impact on pre-tax ROCE (controlled). See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ in the consolidated financial statements for more 
information.  
Comprises adjustments to exclude the results of Vantage Towers following its disposal on 22 March 2023 and hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. Consequently, FY22 capital employed 
for calculating pre-tax ROCE (controlled) and capital employed for calculating post-tax ROCE (controlled and associates/joint ventures) have been adjusted to €69,050 million and €74,373 
million, respectively, for the purposes of calculating relevant FY23 averages.     
Adjusted share of results of equity accounted associates and joint ventures used in post-tax ROCE is a non-GAAP measure and excludes restructuring costs and other income.   
Includes tax at the Adjusted effective tax rate of 26.2% (FY22: 27.9%).

The results for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that Indus Towers Limited is no longer reported as held for sale. This has resulted in an increase in profit 
before taxation and adjusted profit before taxation of €149 million and €191 million, respectively. This has been offset by an equivalent decrease of €191 million in the adjusted share of 
results of equity accounted associates and joint ventures. Consequently, there is no net impact on the adjusted profit before tax for calculating adjusted effective tax rate and therefore there 
is no change to the adjusted effective tax rate. See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ in the consolidated financial statements for more information.

AGM
Our thirty-ninth AGM will be held at The Pavilion, Vodafone House, 
Newbury RG14 2FN on Tuesday, 25 July 2023 at 10.00 am.

Shareholder communications
We are taking significant steps to reduce our impact on our planet. The 
use of electronic communications, rather than printed paper documents, 
means information about the Company can be accessed through emails 
or the Company’s website, thus reducing our impact on the environment.

A growing number of our shareholders have opted to receive 
communications from us electronically. Shareholders who have done 
so will be sent an email alert containing a link to the relevant documents.

We encourage all our shareholders to sign up for this service. You can 
register for this service at www.shareview.co.uk or by contacting Equiniti 
on the telephone number provided on the left of this page.

See vodafone.com/investor  
for further information about this service

ShareGift
We support ShareGift, the charity share donation scheme (registered 
charity number 1052686). Through ShareGift, shareholders who 
have only a very small number of shares, which might be considered 
uneconomic to sell, are able to donate them to charity. Donated shares 
are aggregated and sold by ShareGift with the proceeds being passed 
on to a wide range of UK charities.

See sharegift.org or call +44 (0)20 7930 3737  
for further details.

Warning to shareholders (‘boiler room’ scams)
Over recent years we have become aware of investors who have received 
unsolicited calls or correspondence, in some cases purporting to have 
been issued by us, concerning investment matters. These callers typically 
make claims of highly profitable investment opportunities which turn 
out to be worthless or simply do not exist. These approaches are usually 
made by unauthorised companies and individuals and are commonly 
known as ’boiler room’ scams. Investors are advised to be wary of any 
unsolicited advice or offers to buy shares. If it sounds too good to be 
true, it often is.

Dividends

Read more on the dividend amount per share  
on pages 25 and 218.

Euro dividends
Dividends are declared in euros to align with the functional currency of 
the Company, and paid in euros and pounds sterling according to where 
the shareholder is resident. Cash dividends to ADS holders are paid by the 
ADS depositary bank in US dollars. The foreign exchange rates at which 
dividends declared in euros are converted into pounds sterling and US 
dollars are calculated based on the average exchange rate of the five 
business days during the week prior to the payment of the dividend.

Payment of dividends by direct credit
We pay cash dividends directly to shareholders’ bank or building society 
accounts. This ensures secure delivery and means dividend payments 
are credited to shareholders’ designated accounts on the same day as 
payment. A dividend confirmation covering both the interim and final 
dividends paid during the financial year is sent to shareholders at the 
time of the interim dividend in February. ADS holders may choose to 
have their cash dividends paid by cheque from our ADS depositary 
bank, J.P. Morgan.

The Directors are empowered under the Articles of Association to 
exercise all the powers of the Company subject to any restrictions in the 
Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 (as defined in the Articles

relevant disclosures made in accordance with DTR 5.

On 24 April 2023, e& and two of its affiliates reported a total shareholding 
in Vodafone of 14.61% as of 12 April 2023 in a Schedule 13D filing with 
the SEC. Except as disclosed in e&’s Schedule 13D filing, the Company is 
not aware of any other changes in the interests disclosed under DTR 5 
between 31 March 2023 and 15 May 2023.

As far as the Company is aware, between 1 April 2016 and 15 May 2023, 
no shareholder, other than described above, held 3% or more of the 
voting rights attributable to the ordinary shares of the Company 
other than (i) J.P. Morgan, as custodian of our ADR program, (ii) e&, 
BlackRock, Inc., Liberty Global plc and Norges Bank (as described above) 
and (iii) Morgan Stanley, which owned 3.6% of the Company’s ordinary 
shares at 13 February 2018.

The rights attaching to the ordinary shares of the Company held by 
these shareholders are identical in all respects to the rights attaching to 
all the ordinary shares of the Company. As at 15 May 2023, the Directors 
are not aware of any other interest of 3% or more in the ordinary share 
capital of the Company. The Company is not directly or indirectly owned 

Under the Company’s Articles of Association a Director cannot vote in 
respect of any proposal in which the Director, or any person connected 
with the Director, has a material interest other than by virtue of the 
Director’s interest in the Company’s shares or other securities. However, 
this restriction on voting does not apply in certain circumstances as set 
out in the Articles of Association.

The Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Company 
to borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount of 
all liabilities and obligations of the Group outstanding at any time shall not 
exceed an amount equal to 1.5 times the aggregate of the Group’s share 
capital and reserves calculated in the manner prescribed in the Articles 
of Association unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders.

Purchase of own shares
The Company can make market purchases of its own shares or agree 
to do so in the future provided it is duly authorised by its members in a 
general meeting and subject to and in accordance with section 701 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Such authority was given at the 2022 AGM. 
On 9 March 2022, the Company announced the first tranche of the 
irrevocable and non-discretionary share buy-back programme as a result 
of the maturing of the first tranche of the mandatory convertible bond 
(‘MCB’), as announced on 19 March 2021, had concluded. Following the 
maturing of the second tranche of the MCB, the Company announced 
that a new irrevocable and non-discretionary share buy-back programme 
would commence on 17 March 2022. In order to satisfy the conversion 
of the second tranche of the MCB, 1,518,629,693 shares were issued 
from existing shares held in treasury. Between 17 March 2022 and 15 
November 2022, Vodafone undertook an irrevocable and non-
discretionary share buy-back programme to reduce the issued share 
capital of Vodafone to partially offset the increase in the issued share 
capital as a result of the maturing of the second tranche of the MCB. On 
16 November 2022, the Company announced that a new irrevocable and 
non-discretionary share buy-back programme (the ‘New Programme’)

would commence. The sole purpose of the New Programme was to 
further reduce the issued share capital of the Company to offset the 
increase in the issued share capital as a result of the maturing of the 
second tranche of the MCB. Following the completion of the New 
Programme on 15 March 2023, the increase in the issued share capital as 
a result of the maturing of the second tranche of the MCB has been fully 
offset. The total number of shares purchased to offset the maturing of 
the second tranche of the MCB was below the number permitted to be 
purchased by the Company pursuant to the authority granted by the 
shareholders at the 2022 AGM.

At each AGM all Directors, who are to remain on the Board, shall offer 
themselves for election or re-election, as applicable, in accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association and in the interests of good 
corporate governance.

Directors are not required under the Company’s Articles of Association 
to hold any shares of the Company as a qualification to act as a Director, 
although the Executive Directors are required to under the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy.

Dividend rights
Holders of 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are entitled to be paid 
in respect of each financial year, or other accounting period of the 
Company, a fixed cumulative preferential dividend of 7% p.a. on the 
nominal value of the fixed rate shares. A fixed cumulative preferential 
dividend may only be paid out of available distributable profits which 
the Directors have resolved should be distributed.

The fixed rate shares do not have any other right to share in the 
Company’s profits.

Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares may, by ordinary resolution, 
declare dividends but may not declare dividends in excess of the amount 
recommended by the Directors. The Board of Directors may also pay 
interim dividends. No dividend may be paid other than out of profits 
available for distribution.

Dividends on ordinary shares can be paid to shareholders in whatever 
currency the Directors decide, using an appropriate exchange rate for 
any currency conversions which are required.

If a dividend has not been claimed for one year after the date of the 
resolution passed at a general meeting declaring that dividend or the 
resolution of the Directors providing for payment of that dividend, the 
Directors may invest the dividend or use it in some other way for the 
benefit of the Company until the dividend is claimed. If the dividend 
remains unclaimed for 12 years after the relevant resolution either 
declaring that dividend or providing for payment of that dividend, 
it will be forfeited and belong to the Company.

Voting rights
At a general meeting of the Company, when voting on substantive 
resolutions (i.e. any resolution which is not a procedural resolution) each 
shareholder who is entitled to vote and is present in person or by proxy 
has one vote for every share held (a poll vote). Procedural resolutions 
(such as a resolution to adjourn a general meeting or a resolution on the 
choice of Chair of a general meeting) shall be decided on a show of 
hands, where each shareholder who is present at the meeting has one 
vote regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is demanded.

Shareholders entitled to vote at general meetings may appoint proxies 
who are entitled to vote, attend and speak at general meetings. Two 
shareholders present in person or by proxy constitute a quorum for 
purposes of a general meeting of the Company.

Under English law, shareholders of a public company such as the 
Company are not permitted to pass resolutions by written consent. 
Record holders of the Company’s ADSs are entitled to attend, speak 
and vote on a poll or a show of hands at any general meeting of the 
Company’s shareholders by the depositary’s appointment of them 
as corporate representatives or proxies with respect to the underlying 
ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Alternatively, holders of ADSs 
are entitled to vote by supplying their voting instructions to the 
depositary or its nominee who will vote the ordinary shares underlying 
their ADSs in accordance with their instructions.

Holders of the Company’s ADSs are entitled to receive notices of 
shareholders’ meetings under the terms of the deposit agreement 
relating to the ADSs.

Employees who hold vested shares on EquatePlus account are able to 
vote by submitting instructions online through the EquatePlus platform. 
Note there are two vested share accounts with Computershare (SPA, in 
respect of shares arising from a SAYE exercise, and MyShareBank, in 
respect of vested shares from the Global Incentive Plan).

Holders of the Company’s 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are only 
entitled to vote on any resolution to vary or abrogate the rights attached 
to the fixed rate shares. Holders have one vote for every fully paid 7% 
cumulative fixed rate share.

Liquidation rights
In the event of the liquidation of the Company, after payment of all 
liabilities and deductions in accordance with English law, the holders of 
the Company’s 7% cumulative fixed rate shares would be entitled to a 
sum equal to the capital paid up on such shares, together with certain 
dividend payments, in priority to holders of the Company’s ordinary 
shares. The holders of the fixed rate shares do not have any other right 
to share in the Company’s surplus assets.

Pre-emptive rights and new issues of shares
Under section 549 of the Companies Act 2006 Directors are, with certain 
exceptions, unable to allot the Company’s ordinary shares or securities 
convertible into the Company’s ordinary shares without the authority of the 
shareholders in a general meeting. In addition, section 561 of the 
Companies Act 2006 imposes further restrictions on the issue of equity 
securities (as defined in the Companies Act 2006 and which include the 
Company’s ordinary shares and securities convertible into ordinary shares) 
which are, or are to be, paid up wholly in cash and not first offered to existing 
shareholders. The Company’s Articles of Association allow shareholders to 
authorise Directors for a period specified in the relevant resolution to allot (i) 
relevant securities generally up to an amount fixed by the shareholders; and 
(ii) equity securities for cash other than in connection with a pre-emptive 
offer up to an amount specified by the shareholders and free of the 
pre-emption restriction in section 561. At the 2022 AGM the amount of 
relevant securities fixed by shareholders under (i) above and the amount of 
equity securities specified by shareholders under (ii) above were in line with 
the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles.

Further details of such proposals are provided in the 2023 Notice of AGM.

Disclosure of interests in the Company’s shares
There are no provisions in the Articles of Association whereby persons 
acquiring, holding or disposing of a certain percentage of the Company’s 
shares are required to make disclosure of their ownership percentage 
although such requirements exist under the DTRs.

General meetings and notices
Subject to the Articles of Association, AGMs are held at such times and 
place as determined by the Directors of the Company. The Directors 
may also, when they think fit, convene other general meetings of the 
Company. General meetings may also be convened on requisition as 
provided by the Companies Act 2006.

An AGM is required to be called on not less than 21 days’ notice in 
writing. Subject to obtaining shareholder approval on an annual basis, 
the Company may call other general meetings on 14 days’ notice. 
The Directors may determine that persons entitled to receive notices 
of meetings are those persons entered on the register at the close of 
business on a day determined by the Directors but not later than 21 days 
before the date the relevant notice is sent. The notice may also specify 
the record date, the time of which shall be determined in accordance 
with the Articles of Association and the Companies Act 2006.

Under section 336 of the Companies Act 2006, the AGM must be held 
each calendar year and within six months of the Company’s year end.

Variation of rights
If at any time the Company’s share capital is divided into different classes 
of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006, either with the consent in writing 
of the holders of three quarters in nominal value of the shares of that 
class or at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.

At every such separate meeting all of the provisions of the Articles of 
Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except 
that (i) the quorum is to be the number of persons (which must be at least 
two) who hold or represent by proxy not less than one third in nominal 
value of the issued shares of the class or, if such quorum is not present 
at an adjourned meeting, one person who holds shares of the class 
regardless of the number of shares he holds; (ii) any person present in 
person or by proxy may demand a poll; and (iii) each shareholder will have 
one vote per share held in that particular class in the event a poll is taken. 
Class rights are deemed not to have been varied by the creation or issue 
of new shares ranking equally with or subsequent to that class of shares 
in sharing in profits or assets of the Company or by a redemption or 
repurchase of the shares by the Company.

Limitations on transfer, voting and shareholding
As far as the Company is aware there are no limitations imposed on the 
transfer, holding or voting of the Company’s ordinary shares other than 
those limitations that would generally apply to all of the shareholders, 
those that apply by law (e.g. due to insider dealing rules) or those that 
apply as a result of failure to comply with a notice under section 793 
of the Companies Act 2006.

No shareholder has any securities carrying special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities.

Documents on display
The Company is subject to the information requirements of the 
Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers. In accordance with 
these requirements the Company files its Annual Report on Form 20-F

Exchange controls
There are no UK Government laws, decrees or regulations that restrict or 
affect the export or import of capital including, but not limited to, foreign 
exchange controls on remittance of dividends on the ordinary shares or 
on the conduct of the Group’s operations.

Taxation
As this is a complex area, investors should consult their own tax 
adviser regarding the US federal, state and local, the UK and other tax 
consequences of owning and disposing of shares and ADSs in their 
particular circumstances.

This section describes, primarily for a US holder (as defined below), 
in general terms, the principal US federal income tax and UK tax 
consequences of owning or disposing of shares or ADSs in the Company 
held as capital assets (for US and UK tax purposes). This section does not, 
however, cover the tax consequences for members of certain classes of 
holders subject to special rules including, for example, US expatriates and 
former long-term residents of the United States; officers and employees 
of the Company; holders that, directly, indirectly or by attribution, 
hold 5% or more of the Company’s stock (by vote or value); financial 
institutions; insurance companies; individual retirement accounts 
and other tax-deferred accounts; tax-exempt organisations; dealers in 
securities or currencies; investors that will hold shares or ADSs as part of 
straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for US federal 
income tax purposes; investors holding shares or ADSs in connection with 
a trade or business conducted outside of the US; or US holders whose 
functional currency is not the US dollar.

Shareholder information (continued)

A US holder is a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs that is for US federal 
income tax purposes:

 – an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
 – a US domestic corporation;
 – an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income tax 

regardless of its source; or

 – a trust, if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s 
administration and one or more US persons are authorised to control 
all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to 
be treated as a domestic trust for US federal income tax purposes.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal 
income tax purposes holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income 
tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on 
the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. Holders 
that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for US federal 
income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning the 
US federal income tax consequences to them and their partners of 
the ownership and disposition of shares or ADSs by the partnership.

This section is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations 
thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, and on the tax laws 
of the UK, the Double Taxation Convention between the United States 
and the UK (the ‘treaty’) and current HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) 
practice, all as of the date hereof. These laws and such practice are 
subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.

This section is further based in part upon the representations of the 
depositary and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement 
and any related agreement will be performed in accordance 
with its terms.

For the purposes of the treaty and the US-UK double taxation convention 
relating to estate and gift taxes (the ‘Estate Tax Convention’), and for US 
federal income tax and UK tax purposes, this section is based on the 
assumption that a holder of ADRs evidencing ADSs will generally be 
treated as the owner of the shares in the Company represented by 
those ADRs. Investors should note that a ruling by the first-tier tax 
tribunal in the UK has cast doubt on this view, but HMRC have stated that 
they will continue to apply their long-standing practice of regarding the 
holder of such ADRs as holding the beneficial interest in the underlying 
shares. Similarly, the US Treasury has expressed concern that US holders 
of depositary receipts (such as holders of ADRs representing our ADSs) 
may be claiming foreign tax credits in situations where an intermediary 
in the chain of ownership between such holders and the issuer of the 
security underlying the depositary receipts, or a party to whom depositary 
receipts or deposited shares are delivered by the depositary prior to 
the receipt by the depositary of the corresponding securities, has taken 
actions inconsistent with the ownership of the underlying security by 
the person claiming the credit, such as a disposition of such security. 
Such actions may also be inconsistent with the claiming of the 
reduced tax rates that may be applicable to certain dividends received 
by certain non-corporate holders, as described below. Accordingly, (i) the 
creditability of any UK taxes and (ii) the availability of the reduced tax rates 
for any dividends received by certain non-corporate US holders, each as 
described below, could be affected by actions taken by such parties or 
intermediaries. Generally exchanges of shares for ADRs and ADRs for 
shares will not be subject to US federal income tax or to UK tax other 
than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax.

Taxation of dividends
UK taxation
Under current UK law, there is no requirement to withhold tax from the 
dividends that we pay. Shareholders who are within the charge to UK 
corporation tax will be subject to corporation tax on the dividends we 
pay unless the dividends fall within an exempt class and certain other 
conditions are met. It is expected that the dividends we pay would 
generally be exempt.

Individual shareholders in the Company who are resident in the UK will 
be subject to the income tax on the dividends we pay. Dividends will 
be taxable in the UK at the dividend rates applicable where the income 
received is above the dividend allowance (£1,000 in this tax year, falling to 
£500 from 6 April 2024) which is taxed at a nil rate. Dividend income is 
treated as the highest part of an individual shareholder’s income and the 
dividend allowance will count towards the basic or higher rate limits (as 
applicable) which may affect the rate of tax due on any dividend income 
in excess of the allowance.

US federal income taxation
Subject to the passive foreign investment company (‘PFIC’) rules 
described below, a US holder is subject to US federal income taxation 
on the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current or 
accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal 
income tax purposes). Distributions in excess of current and accumulated 
earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to 
the extent of the US holder’s basis in the shares or ADSs and thereafter 
as capital gain.

However, the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings 
and profits in accordance with US federal income tax accounting 
principles. US holders should therefore assume that any distribution by 
the Company with respect to shares will be reported as ordinary dividend 
income. Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder will be taxable to 
the holder at the reduced rate normally applicable to long-term capital 
gains provided that certain requirements are met.

Dividends must be included in income when the US holder, in the case 
of shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively 
receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the dividends-received 
deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends 
received from other US corporations.

The amount of the dividend distribution to be included in income will 
be the US dollar value of the pound sterling or euro payments made 
determined at the spot pound sterling/US dollar rate or the spot euro/
US dollar rate, as applicable, on the date the dividends are received 
by the US holder, in the case of shares, or the depositary, in the case 
of ADSs, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US 
dollars at that time. If dividends received in pounds sterling or euros are 
converted into US dollars on the day they are received, the US holder 
generally will not be required to recognise any foreign currency gain 
or loss in respect of the dividend income.

Where UK tax is payable on any dividends received, a US holder may 
be entitled, subject to certain limitations, to a foreign tax credit in respect 
of such taxes.

Taxation of capital gains
UK taxation
A US holder that is not resident in the UK will generally not be liable 
for UK tax in respect of any capital gain realised on a disposal of our 
shares or ADSs.

 – an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income tax

Under current UK law, there is no requirement to withhold tax from the 

dividends that we pay. Shareholders who are within the charge to UK

administration and one or more US persons are authorised to control 

all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to 

be treated as a domestic trust for US federal income tax purposes.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal 

income tax purposes holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income 

tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on 

the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. Holders 

that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for US federal 

income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning the 

US federal income tax consequences to them and their partners of 

the ownership and disposition of shares or ADSs by the partnership.

This section is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 

amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations 

thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, and on the tax laws 

of the UK, the Double Taxation Convention between the United States 

and the UK (the ‘treaty’) and current HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) 

practice, all as of the date hereof. These laws and such practice are 

subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.

This section is further based in part upon the representations of the 

depositary and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement 

and any related agreement will be performed in accordance 

with its terms.

For the purposes of the treaty and the US-UK double taxation convention 

relating to estate and gift taxes (the ‘Estate Tax Convention’), and for US 

federal income tax and UK tax purposes, this section is based on the 

assumption that a holder of ADRs evidencing ADSs will generally be 

treated as the owner of the shares in the Company represented by 

those ADRs. Investors should note that a ruling by the first-tier tax 

tribunal in the UK has cast doubt on this view, but HMRC have stated that 

they will continue to apply their long-standing practice of regarding the 

holder of such ADRs as holding the beneficial interest in the underlying 

shares. Similarly, the US Treasury has expressed concern that US holders 

of depositary receipts (such as holders of ADRs representing our ADSs) 

may be claiming foreign tax credits in situations where an intermediary 

in the chain of ownership between such holders and the issuer of the 

security underlying the depositary receipts, or a party to whom depositary 

receipts or deposited shares are delivered by the depositary prior to 

the receipt by the depositary of the corresponding securities, has taken 

actions inconsistent with the ownership of the underlying security by 

the person claiming the credit, such as a disposition of such security. 

Such actions may also be inconsistent with the claiming of the 

reduced tax rates that may be applicable to certain dividends received 

by certain non-corporate holders, as described below. Accordingly, (i) the 

creditability of any UK taxes and (ii) the availability of the reduced tax rates 

for any dividends received by certain non-corporate US holders, each as 

described below, could be affected by actions taken by such parties or 

intermediaries. Generally exchanges of shares for ADRs and ADRs for 

shares will not be subject to US federal income tax or to UK tax other 

than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax.

Individual shareholders in the Company who are resident in the UK will 

be subject to the income tax on the dividends we pay. Dividends will 

be taxable in the UK at the dividend rates applicable where the income 

received is above the dividend allowance (£1,000 in this tax year, falling to 

£500 from 6 April 2024) which is taxed at a nil rate. Dividend income is 

treated as the highest part of an individual shareholder’s income and the 

dividend allowance will count towards the basic or higher rate limits (as 

applicable) which may affect the rate of tax due on any dividend income 

in excess of the allowance.

US federal income taxation

Subject to the passive foreign investment company (‘PFIC’) rules 

described below, a US holder is subject to US federal income taxation 

on the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current or 

accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal 

income tax purposes). Distributions in excess of current and accumulated 

earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to 

the extent of the US holder’s basis in the shares or ADSs and thereafter 

as capital gain.

However, the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings 

and profits in accordance with US federal income tax accounting 

principles. US holders should therefore assume that any distribution by 

the Company with respect to shares will be reported as ordinary dividend 

income. Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder will be taxable to 

the holder at the reduced rate normally applicable to long-term capital 

gains provided that certain requirements are met.

Dividends must be included in income when the US holder, in the case 

of shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively 

receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the dividends-received 

deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends 

received from other US corporations.

The amount of the dividend distribution to be included in income will 

be the US dollar value of the pound sterling or euro payments made 

determined at the spot pound sterling/US dollar rate or the spot euro/

US dollar rate, as applicable, on the date the dividends are received 

by the US holder, in the case of shares, or the depositary, in the case 

of ADSs, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US 

dollars at that time. If dividends received in pounds sterling or euros are 

converted into US dollars on the day they are received, the US holder 

generally will not be required to recognise any foreign currency gain 

or loss in respect of the dividend income.

Where UK tax is payable on any dividends received, a US holder may 

be entitled, subject to certain limitations, to a foreign tax credit in respect 

of such taxes.

Taxation of capital gains

UK taxation

A US holder that is not resident in the UK will generally not be liable 

for UK tax in respect of any capital gain realised on a disposal of our 

shares or ADSs.

However, a US holder may be liable for both UK and US tax in respect of 
a gain on the disposal of our shares or ADSs if the US holder:

Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill 2022 (if enacted 
without amendment).

No stamp duty should in practice be required to be paid on any transfer of 
our ADSs provided that the ADSs and any separate instrument of transfer 
are executed and retained at all times outside the UK.

A transfer of our shares in registered form will attract ad valorem stamp 
duty generally at the rate of 0.5% of the purchase price of the shares. 
There is no charge to ad valorem stamp duty on gifts.

SDRT is generally payable on an unconditional agreement to transfer 
our shares in registered form at 0.5% of the amount or value of the 
consideration for the transfer, but if, within six years of the date of the 
agreement, an instrument transferring the shares is executed and 
stamped, any SDRT which has been paid would be repayable or, if the 
SDRT has not been paid, the liability to pay the tax (but not necessarily 
interest and penalties) would be cancelled. However, an agreement to 
transfer our ADSs will not give rise to SDRT.

PFIC rules
We do not believe that our shares or ADSs will be stock of a PFIC 
for US federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year or 
the foreseeable future. This conclusion is a factual determination 
that is made annually and thus is subject to change. If we are a PFIC, 
US holders of shares would be required (i) to pay a special US addition 
to tax on certain distributions and (ii) any gain realised on the sale 
or other disposition of the shares or ADSs would in general not 
be treated as a capital gain unless a US holder elects to be taxed 
annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to the shares or ADSs.

Otherwise a US holder would be treated as if he or she has realised such 
gain and certain ‘excess distributions’ rateably over the holding period 
for the shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect 
for each such year to which the gain was allocated. An interest charge in 
respect of the tax attributable to each such preceding year beginning with 
the first such year in which our shares or ADSs were treated as stock in a 
PFIC would also apply. In addition, dividends received from us would not 
be eligible for the reduced rate of tax described above under ‘Taxation 
of dividends – US federal income taxation’.

Back-up withholding and information reporting
Payments of dividends and other proceeds to a US holder with respect 
to shares or ADSs, by a US paying agent or other US intermediary will 
be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and to the US holder as may 
be required under applicable regulations. Back-up withholding may apply 
to these payments if the US holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer 
identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to comply 
with applicable certification requirements.

Certain US holders are not subject to back-up withholding. US holders 
should consult their tax advisers about these rules and any other 
reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or disposition 
of shares or ADSs, including requirements related to the holding of 
certain foreign financial assets.

 – is a citizen of the United States and is resident in the UK;
 – is an individual who realises such a gain during a period of ‘temporary 
non-residence’ (broadly, where the individual becomes resident in the 
UK, having ceased to be so resident for a period of five years or less, 
and was resident in the UK for at least four out of the seven tax years 
immediately preceding the year of departure from the UK);

 – is a US domestic corporation resident in the UK by reason of being 

centrally managed and controlled in the UK; or

 – is a citizen or a resident of the United States, or a US domestic 

corporation, that has used, held or acquired the shares or ADSs in 
connection with a branch, agency or permanent establishment in the 
UK through which it carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK.

In such circumstances, relief from double taxation may be available 
under the treaty. Holders who may fall within one of the above categories 
should consult their professional advisers.

US federal income taxation
Subject to the PFIC rules described below, a US holder that sells or 
otherwise disposes of our shares or ADSs generally will recognise a 
capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the 
difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the amount realised and 
the holder’s adjusted tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the shares or 
ADSs. This capital gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the 
US holder’s holding period in the shares or ADSs exceeds one year.

The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the 
US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of losses 
is subject to limitations.

Additional tax considerations
UK inheritance tax
An individual who is domiciled in the United States (for the purposes of 
the Estate Tax Convention) and is not a UK national will not be subject 
to UK inheritance tax in respect of our shares or ADSs on the individual’s 
death or on a transfer of the shares or ADSs during the individual’s 
lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax is paid, 
unless the shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a UK 
permanent establishment or pertain to a UK fixed base used for the 
performance of independent personal services. Where the shares or 
ADSs have been placed in trust by a settlor they may be subject to UK 
inheritance tax unless, when the trust was created, the settlor was 
domiciled in the United States and was not a UK national. Where the 
shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to US federal 
gift or estate tax, the estate tax convention generally provides a credit 
against US federal tax liabilities for UK inheritance tax paid.

UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
Stamp duty will, subject to certain exceptions, be payable on any 
instrument transferring our shares to the custodian of the depositary at 
the rate of 1.5% on the amount or value of the consideration if on sale or 
on the value of such shares if not on sale. Stamp duty reserve tax (‘SDRT’), 
at the rate of 1.5% of the amount or value of the consideration or the 
value of the shares, could also be payable in these circumstances but 
no SDRT will be payable if stamp duty equal to such SDRT liability is paid.

Following rulings of the European Court of Justice and the first-tier tax 
tribunal in the UK, HMRC have confirmed that the 1.5% SDRT charge will 
not be levied on an issue of shares to a depositary receipt system on the 
basis that such a charge is contrary to EU law. The effect of this EU case 
law will continue to be recognised and followed in the United Kingdom 
pursuant to the provisions of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, 
even though the United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU, and HMRC’s 
published practice remains that the 1.5% charge will remain disapplied in 
such cases. However, this treatment may be modified as a result of the

Regulation

Unaudited information

Introduction
Our operating companies are generally subject to regulation governing 
their business activities. Such regulation typically takes the form of 
industry-specific law and regulation covering telecommunications 
services and general competition (anti-trust) law applicable to all 
activities. The following section describes the regulatory frameworks and 
the key regulatory developments at national and regional level and in the 
European Union (‘EU’), in which we had significant interests during the 
period ended 31 March 2023. Many of the regulatory developments 
reported in the following section involve ongoing proceedings or 
consideration of potential proceedings that have not reached a 
conclusion. Accordingly, we are unable to attach a specific level of 
financial risk to our performance from such matters.

European Union (‘EU’) 
The European Electronic Communications Code (‘Code’) has updated the 
telecoms regulatory framework in Europe. The transposition process was 
due in December 2020 across all the Member States, but it has 
experienced delays in several countries. As a consequence, the European 
Commission (‘EC’) started infringement procedures against the remaining 
Member States at the same time, and afterwards referred the breach to 
the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘CJEU’). As of 31 March 2023, 
all markets (within our footprint) have transposed the Code into national 
legislation. Additionally, outside the EU, Albania is consulting on the 
transposition of the Code into Albanian legislation, with aim of fully 
aligning Albanian telecommunications legislation with the EU, as part of 
the integration package for the accession of Albania to the EU. 

Addressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Next 
Generation EU package is the Union’s means to support the recovery 
processes in EU Member States. The bulk of the proposed recovery 
measures are funded by a new temporary recovery instrument, the EU 
Recovery and Resilience Facility (‘RRF’), worth nearly €750 billion, which 
was adopted in December 2020. A significant amount is allocated 
towards digital and green initiatives, with a minimum threshold of 20% of 
the RRF to be allocated to digital and 37% to green initiatives. As of 31 
March 2023, the EC had approved the national plans under the RRF for all 
27 EU Member States, of which Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, 
Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain are within Vodafone’s footprint. 

In February 2022, the EC published its proposal for a regulation laying 
down harmonised rules on fair access to and fair use of data (the ‘Data 
Act’). The Regulation applies to manufacturers of connected devices, data 
holders, recipients, and providers of data processing services (cloud 
service providers) who will be subject to new requirements to support 
switching and interoperability. Negotiations are ongoing.

The Digital Markets Act (‘DMA’) was agreed in March 2022 and published 
in the official EU Journal in November 2022. The Commission is preparing 
for implementation. Providers of online platforms who pass the 
quantitative thresholds to be designated as ’gatekeepers’ (annual 
turnover of €7.5 billion within the EU or a worldwide market valuation of 
€75 billion, plus 45 million monthly active end-users and 10,000 business 
users) will be subject new ex-ante regulatory obligations under the DMA. 
This designation will take place between May and September 2023, with 
a grace period of six months thereafter before enforcement proceedings 
will begin in early 2024.

The Digital Services Act (‘DSA’) was also agreed in 2022 and published in 
the official EU Journal in November 2022. Online platforms, who have 
new obligations under the DSA, will be required to report their numbers 
of active users to the Commission, to inform the designation of Very 
Large Online Platforms (‘VLOPs’) who will be subject to additional risk 
assessment and platform design obligations. For the VLOPs, enforcement 
will begin in mid-2023, however, obligations for online platforms below 
this threshold will not take effect until early 2024.

The Company was incorporated under English law in 1984 as Racal 
Strategic Radio Limited (registered number 1833679). After various 
name changes, 20% of Racal Telecom Plc share capital was offered 
to the public in October 1988. The Company was fully demerged 
from Racal Electronics Plc and became an independent company 
in September 1991 at which time it changed its name to Vodafone 
Group Plc. Since then we have entered into various transactions which 
impacted the development of the Group. The most significant in the year 
ended 31 March 2023 are summarised below. 

 – On 9 November 2022, the Vodafone Group announced a strategic 

co-control partnership with GIP and KKR for its 81.7% stake in Vantage 
Towers AG (‘Vantage Towers’). On 13 December 2022, the new joint 
venture, Oak Holdings GmbH (‘Oak Holdings’), launched a voluntary 
takeover offer to minority shareholders of Vantage Towers and this 
completed in January 2023. Following completion of the voluntary 
takeover offer, Oak Holdings holds a 89.3% stake in Vantage Towers. 
On 23 March 2023, Vodafone announced the completion of the 
co-control partnership and received initial net cash proceeds of €4.9 
billion. Following completion Vodafone now holds a 64.2% 
shareholding in Oak Holdings. Oak Holdings and Vantage Towers have 
separately reached an agreement on a domination and profit and loss 
transfer agreement which was approved by Vantage Towers 
shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on 5 May 2023. Oak 
Holdings also announced on 20 March 2023 an agreement to de-list 
the shares of Vantage Towers. 

 – On 13 December 2022, the Vodafone Group completed the transfer 
of its 55% shareholding in Vodafone Egypt to its subsidiary, Vodacom 
Group Limited (‘Vodacom’). The Vodafone Group was issued 242 
million shares in Vodacom and received cash proceeds of €577 million 
in exchange for its shareholding in Vodafone Egypt. As a result, 
Vodafone’s shareholding in Vodacom increased from 60.5% to 65.1%.
 – On 31 January 2023, the Vodafone Group completed the sale of 100% 

of Vodafone Hungary (Vodafone Magyarország Zrt) to 4iG Public 
Limited Company and Corvinus Zrt for a cash consideration of HUF 
660 billion (€1.6 billion).

 – On 7 February 2023, Vodafone Idea Limited (‘Vi’) converted liabilities 
owed to the Government of India into equity shares. Following the 
transaction, the Government of India’s shareholding in Vi was 33.4%, 
and Vodafone Group’s shareholding was 31.7%.

 – On 14 February 2023, the Vodafone Group exercised warrants issued 
by Vi in July 2022. The total consideration of INR 4.4 billion (€49 
million) was settled on issuance of the warrants in July 2022 and 
Vodafone Group received an additional 428 million shares in February 
2023. Following the issuance of shares, Vodafone’s holding in Vi was 
equivalent to a 32.3% shareholding, with the Government of India’s 
shareholding being diluted to 33.1%. 

 – On 21 February 2023, the Vodafone Group completed the sale of its 
70% shareholding in Vodafone Ghana (Ghana Telecommunications 
Company Limited) to Telecel Group. 

 – On 7 March 2023, the Vodafone Group completed the sale of 50% 

of its German fibre-to-the-home (‘FTTH’) company to Altice. The joint 
venture will deploy FTTH to up to seven million homes in Germany 
over six years and will offer wholesale access to all 
telecommunications service providers, with Vodafone Germany 
as the anchor tenant. 

 – On 29 March 2023, the Vodafone Group announced the initiation 
of procedures for a statutory merger and squeeze-out of minority 
shareholders in Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (’KDG’). As of 31 March 
2023, Vodafone owned 94.0% of KDG’s share capital. Vodafone KDG 
will acquire the shares of all KDG minority shareholders, and KDG will 
be merged into Vodafone KDG.

Unaudited information

Introduction

Our operating companies are generally subject to regulation governing 

their business activities. Such regulation typically takes the form of 

industry-specific law and regulation covering telecommunications 

services and general competition (anti-trust) law applicable to all 

activities. The following section describes the regulatory frameworks and 

the key regulatory developments at national and regional level and in the 

European Union (‘EU’), in which we had significant interests during the 

period ended 31 March 2023. Many of the regulatory developments 

reported in the following section involve ongoing proceedings or 

consideration of potential proceedings that have not reached a 

conclusion. Accordingly, we are unable to attach a specific level of 

financial risk to our performance from such matters.

European Union (‘EU’) 

The European Electronic Communications Code (‘Code’) has updated the 

telecoms regulatory framework in Europe. The transposition process was 

due in December 2020 across all the Member States, but it has 

experienced delays in several countries. As a consequence, the European 

Commission (‘EC’) started infringement procedures against the remaining 

Member States at the same time, and afterwards referred the breach to 

the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘CJEU’). As of 31 March 2023, 

all markets (within our footprint) have transposed the Code into national 

legislation. Additionally, outside the EU, Albania is consulting on the 

transposition of the Code into Albanian legislation, with aim of fully 

Addressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Next 

Generation EU package is the Union’s means to support the recovery 

processes in EU Member States. The bulk of the proposed recovery 

measures are funded by a new temporary recovery instrument, the EU 

Recovery and Resilience Facility (‘RRF’), worth nearly €750 billion, which 

was adopted in December 2020. A significant amount is allocated 

towards digital and green initiatives, with a minimum threshold of 20% of 

the RRF to be allocated to digital and 37% to green initiatives. As of 31 

March 2023, the EC had approved the national plans under the RRF for all 

27 EU Member States, of which Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, 

Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain are within Vodafone’s footprint. 

In February 2022, the EC published its proposal for a regulation laying 

down harmonised rules on fair access to and fair use of data (the ‘Data 

Act’). The Regulation applies to manufacturers of connected devices, data 

holders, recipients, and providers of data processing services (cloud 

service providers) who will be subject to new requirements to support 

switching and interoperability. Negotiations are ongoing.

The Digital Markets Act (‘DMA’) was agreed in March 2022 and published 

in the official EU Journal in November 2022. The Commission is preparing 

for implementation. Providers of online platforms who pass the 

quantitative thresholds to be designated as ’gatekeepers’ (annual 

turnover of €7.5 billion within the EU or a worldwide market valuation of 

€75 billion, plus 45 million monthly active end-users and 10,000 business 

users) will be subject new ex-ante regulatory obligations under the DMA. 

This designation will take place between May and September 2023, with 

a grace period of six months thereafter before enforcement proceedings 

will begin in early 2024.

The Digital Services Act (‘DSA’) was also agreed in 2022 and published in 

the official EU Journal in November 2022. Online platforms, who have 

new obligations under the DSA, will be required to report their numbers 

of active users to the Commission, to inform the designation of Very 

Large Online Platforms (‘VLOPs’) who will be subject to additional risk 

assessment and platform design obligations. For the VLOPs, enforcement 

will begin in mid-2023, however, obligations for online platforms below 

this threshold will not take effect until early 2024.

On 1 July 2022, the EU-Roaming Recast Regulation entered into force, 
prolonging the existing Regulation to ensure the continuation of 
Roam-Like-at-Home (‘RLAH’) for 10 years. The new regulation reduces 
the wholesale price caps for all services (data, voice and SMS) and brings 
new measures on transparency (including on the use of non-terrestrial 
networks), quality of service (‘QoS’) and access to emergency 
communications. In October and December 2022, respectively, the 
European Body of Regulators (‘BEREC’) published its final wholesale and 
retail guidelines providing interpretation guidance to the Regulation. 

On 15 September 2022, the European Commission adopted its draft 
Cyber Resilience Act (‘CRA’), introducing horizontal cybersecurity 
requirements for products with digital elements and associated services 
that are placed on the European single market. Products in scope will be 
subject to conformity assessment. Highly critical products will be subject 
to European cybersecurity certification schemes. The EC’s draft CRA has 
entered the co-legislative process which will be completed at the end of 
2023 at the earliest, with new legislation coming into force during the 
course of 2024 and applicable two years thereafter. 

Negotiations on the Artificial Intelligence Act (‘AI Act’) are progressing, 
with the Council agreeing a General Approach on the file in December 
2022. Annex III of the draft AI Act describes a number of AI systems that 
pose a ‘high risk’ and will therefore be subject to additional ex-ante 
regulatory obligations and conformity assessment process before being 
placed on the market. Amendments in the Parliament and Council 
include ‘management of the Internet’ and ‘safety components of critical 
digital infrastructure’ within Annex III. 

On 15 December 2022, the European institutions jointly signed the 
European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital 
Decade (‘Declaration’), covering issues including inclusion, freedom of 
choice online, online safety and security, and sustainable digitalisation. 
The Declaration puts forward, inter alia, the commitment to “developing 
adequate frameworks so that all market actors benefiting from the digital 
transformation assume their social responsibilities and make a fair and 
proportionate contribution to the costs of public goods, services and 
infrastructures, for the benefit of all people living in the EU”.

In January 2023, the EU Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030 came 
into force. The initiative, a decision of the European Parliament 
(‘Parliament’) and the Council of the European Union (‘Council’), sets 
targets to be met by Member States by 2030 on the following four key 
pillars: a digitally skilled population and highly skilled digital professionals; 
secure and sustainable digital infrastructures (target is to have all 
European households connected to gigabit speeds and all populated 
areas covered by 5G); digital transformation of businesses; and 
digitalisation of public services. Member States should submit to the 
Commission national digital decade strategic roadmaps showing how 
they intend to meet these targets up to 2030. The EC is accountable for 
continually monitoring progress towards these targets by means of key 
performance indicators, which it is currently consulting on. The first report 
towards progress is expected by September 2023. 

In February 2023, the EC published the draft Gigabit Infrastructure Act 
(‘GIA’) (revising the 2014 Broadband Cost Reduction Directive). The GIA 
aims to reduce the cost of deploying gigabit electronic communication 
networks by improving the permit granting process and specifying that 
fees cannot exceed administrative costs. All permit-granting submissions 
will need to go through a single information point in each Member State, 
and timely approval of permits has been strengthened by cutting wait 
times to four months and including the right to compensation for 
damage caused by non-compliance with deadlines. The EC will publish an 
implementing act specifying permit exemption categories, which are 
currently not included in the proposal. This is set to be completed 18 
months following GIA adoption. The GIA is expected to be passed by the 
end of March 2024.

In addition to the GIA proposals, the Commission has published a 
far-reaching consultation on the future of the electronic communications 
sector and its infrastructure. The consultation contains over 60 questions 
over four chapters, covering: (i) technological and market developments; 
(ii) fairness for consumers; (iii) barriers to the single market; and (iv) 
achieving a fair contribution from all digital players to connectivity 
infrastructure. The deadline for response is 19 May 2023.

Country specific
Germany
In July 2022, the national regulatory authority (‘NRA’) (‘BNetzA’) published 
its final regulation regarding the wholesale access markets (so-called 
Market 3a). There have been no significant changes to the regulation of 
copper network access; however the decision does implement a light 
touch regulation of fibre access (‘FTTH’). For the first time in Germany, an 
access regime for FTTH based on full equivalence of input will enforce the 
equal treatment of wholesale demand and Deutsche Telekom’s (‘DT’) 
retail arm. In addition, BNetzA will improve access to DT’s passive 
infrastructure (ducts, masts) due to its significant market power on 
broadband wholesale markets, including introducing regulated prices for 
the first time. In addition, the new regulation prolongs current unbundled 
local loop and bitstream access to DT’s copper network. Additionally, 
BNetzA have published a new draft regulation for wholesale central access 
(so-called Market 3b) for consultation. The final regulation is pending. 

Licences for frequency allocations at 800MHz, parts of 1800MHz, and 
2600MHz will expire at the end of 2025. Vodafone Germany currently 
holds allocations at 800MHz and 2600MHz. BNetzA is therefore assessing 
its options on how to proceed on the reallocation of this spectrum. It may 
either re-auction the spectrum, or prolong the existing licences, or a 
combination of these. BNetzA furthermore considers swapping the licence 
terms for the 800MHz and 900MHz allocations. Thus, 900MHz instead of 
800MHz spectrum would now be auctioned, and the 800MHz allocations 
would be prolonged till 2033. BNetzA is expected to make a final decision 
on next steps by the end of 2023.

In 2019, Vodafone acquired spectrum at 2.1GHz and 3.6GHz. The spectrum 
allocation includes coverage obligations which, depending on the specifics 
of the obligation, to be fulfilled by end of either 2022 or 2024. All mobile 
network operators have reported on time on the status of obligation 
fulfilment for the 2022 obligations, including given judicial or factual 
circumstances hindering fulfilment. BNetzA is assessing the reports, 
including Vodafone’s. Results are expected in June 2023, and it is possible 
that BNetzA will decide to impose fines in event of non-fulfilment.

Italy 
In March 2017, the NRA (‘AGCOM’) imposed a minimum billing period of 
one month for fixed and converged offers, effective by the end of June 
2017. The operators appealed AGCOM’s resolution before the 
Administrative Court and the appeal was rejected in February 2018. 
Vodafone Italy filed an appeal before the Council of State and, after the 
public hearing held in July 2020, the Council of State issued a Preliminary 
referral to the CJEU in order to assess if AGCOM has the power to impose 
minimum and binding billing periods under EU law. The proceeding before 
the CJEU is still pending, with a decision expected by the end of June 2023. 

In January 2020, the national competition authority (‘AGCM’) ruled that 
Vodafone Italy, Telecom Italia (‘TIM’), Fastweb and WindTre had 
coordinated their commercial strategies relating to the transition from 
four-week billing (28 days) to monthly billing, with the maintenance of an 
8.6% price increase, in violation of Art.101 of Treaty on the Functioning of 
the EU (‘TFEU’). In July 2021, the Administrative Tribunal published its 
judgment annulling the AGCM’s decision and fine against Vodafone Italy 
for lack of evidence, accepting all of Vodafone Italy’s defensive arguments. 
According to the Tribunal, the alleged infringement was in fact the 
outcome of the companies’ independent choices to comply with 
legislation imposing an obligation to issue customer bills on a monthly

basis. Prior to the Tribunal decision, Vodafone Italy had agreed to pay the 
€60 million fine in 15 monthly instalments of €4 million each. Following 
the Tribunal decision, Vodafone Italy started the process to be reimbursed 
for the two instalments, totalling €8 million, paid so far. The AGCM has 
submitted an appeal against the Tribunal decision to the Council of State. 
The public hearing was held on 26 January 2023 and Vodafone Italy is 
now waiting for the final decision of the Council of State, which is 
expected before the end of May 2023.

In January 2021, TIM proposed a final fibre network co-investment to 
AGCOM, which was approved in December 2021. However, TIM has 
subsequently sought to amend the co-investment offer, to include the 
ability for it to increase wholesale prices to account for inflation. 
Therefore, in November 2022, AGCOM started a new market consultation 
on the amended co-investment offer, including the new price indexing 
mechanism. The proceedings are not yet concluded, and the final 
decision is expected by June 2023.

United Kingdom 
In November 2021, the Telecommunications Security Act (‘TSA’) was 
passed into legislation. This modified the Communications Act to allow 
the Secretary of State to issue High Risk Vendor (‘HRV’) designations that 
restrict the usage of named equipment suppliers. In October 2022, a HRV 
designation was issued mandating the removal of Huawei from 5G 
networks by the end of 2027 and restricting the use of Huawei 
equipment in UK telecoms networks in the meantime. The TSA also 
allows the Secretary of State to issue security regulations requiring 
providers of electronic communications networks and services to comply 
with a specified Code of Practice. After consultation, in September 2022, 
the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport issued such security 
regulations, and the associated Code of Practice clarified the 
requirements and permitted longer implementation timescales for 
Vodafone UK than had originally been proposed in the TSA. Similarly, 
after consultation Ofcom has established the compliance regime 
associated with the Code of Practice. 

The NRA (‘Ofcom’) concluded a review of UK mobile market in December 
2022. In its conclusions, Ofcom outlined its intention to make decisions 
that will encourage investment in mobile networks. Ofcom also 
confirmed it remained open-minded on the matter of mobile 
consolidation. In parallel, the government’s Wireless Infrastructure 
Strategy review, which is focused on future technologies and 
infrastructure evolution in the sector, is expected to conclude by 
September 2023.

Ofcom’s review of Net Neutrality rules is underway. While the UK is still 
committed to high-level open internet alignment under the terms of the 
UK/EU trade deal, Ofcom has proposed a set of measures designed to aid 
clarity around the interpretation of the existing rules and outlined a more 
permissive approach to matters such as tariff differentiation, network 
slicing and zero rating. Ofcom is expected to conclude its review by 
end of 2023. 

In April 2023, the Government launched its Wireless Infrastructure 
Strategy, which sets out its ambition for 5G between now and 2030. 
The strategy recognises many of the commercial challenges facing the 
sector, setting out a number of initiatives aimed at remedying them. 
These include a plan to set out a clear evidence-based and forward-
looking rationale for setting spectrum fees by the end of 2023; an 
open-minded approach to market consolidation and changes to planning 
rules to make it easier to alter masts. The strategy also signals the 
Government’s desire to incentivise take-up of new technology, including 
releasing funding for local governments and ensuring digital connectivity 
requirements are at the heart of all future major infrastructure projects.

Vodacom: South Africa (‘SA’)
The NRA (‘ICASA’) has concluded a Review of the Pro-competitive 
Conditions imposed on relevant licensees in terms of the Call Termination 
Regulations and published its draft findings document in March 2022. 
However, Telkom (a licensed network operator) has initiated a High Court 

review of the report. ICASA has been unable to conduct the cost 
modelling or publish the final report. There is no information on expected 
timelines for this challenge.

On 3 April 2022, ICASA published a set of amendments to the End-User 
and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations 2016 for public comment. 
The proposed amendments facilitate the easier transfer of unused voice, 
SMS and data credit that is unused at the expiry of a billing period, which 
under the rules shall not expire before a period of six months. Vodacom 
SA submitted a written response to the proposed changes in June 2022 
and participated in a public hearing held by ICASA in October 2022.

Greece; Czech Republic; Albania
Spectrum
In Spain, spectrum auctions were held on 21 September 2022. Vodafone 
Spain acquired two national concessions of 200MHz each, i.e. a total of 
400MHz, for €8 million. Additionally, in December 2022 the National 
State Budget was approved. The law sets a reduction of spectrum fees 
(for 5G bands 700MHz and 3.5 GHz) for a temporary period of two years 
(2022 – 2023). This has resulted in €11.2 million savings per year for 
Vodafone Spain.

In Portugal, in July 2021 the NRA (‘ANACOM’) approved the renewal of 
Vodafone Portugal’s rights of use for 900MHz and 1800MHz until 2033. 
The spectrum renewal came with coverage obligations, which MNOs 
reached an agreement for in June 2022, which was then approved by 
ANACOM in July 2022. Vodafone Portugal has until 13 July 2023 to 
comply with these additional obligations.

Additionally, Vodafone Portugal continues to appeal against certain 
aspects of the auction conditions for the 5G auction, which concluded 
in November 2021, claiming the conditions between new entrants and 
mobile network operators were discriminatory. Legal proceedings are 
still ongoing, with no expected date of conclusion, and the rights of 
use remain in place. 

In Ireland, the NRA (‘ComReg’) progressed with and concluded the main 
stage of the multi-band spectrum auction in December 2022. Vodafone 
Ireland acquired spectrum in the following bands: 2x10MHz in the 
700MHz band, 2x20MHz in the 2.1GHz band, 2x35MHz and 30MHz in 
the 2.6GHz band.

In Romania, in November 2022, the 5G auction ended with Vodafone 
Romania acquiring 2x5MHz in the 700MHz band and 100MHz in the 
3.5GHz band, rights of use starting in January 2023 and January 
2026, respectively.

In Czech Republic, in November 2022, the NRA (‘CTU’) renewed 
Vodafone Czech Republic’s 2100MHz licence until the end of 2041. 
Renewal includes an obligation to keep Global System for Mobile 
communication (‘GSM’) until June 2028 and to improve the quality of 
mobile data service on motorways.

In Albania, there were delays to the planned auction of 5G spectrum in 
all bands. This was due to the new entrant, 4iG, acquiring ONE 
Telecommunications, which resulted in the NRA (‘AKEP’) supporting 
the re-balancing of spectrum between the remaining Albanian MNOs, 
including Vodafone Albania. However, the spectrum re-balancing process 
was successfully closed on 1 January 2023, and the technical transfer 
of the spectrum is expected to be finalised by 30 April 2023. 

As a result, AKEP has announced that the 5G auction for all bands 
(3.5MHz, 26GHz and 700MHz) will start after the technical transfer of the 
spectrum. AKEP has started preliminary discussions with the operators on 
their interest in the bands up for auction, which is expected to happen by 
July 2023. There is no official document yet on the auction model, prices 
and other terms.

Concerns over electromagnetic field (‘EMF’) triggered a residents’ petition

the auction process completing in December 2020 and the assigned 
spectrum already being in use by Vodafone Greece, the petition against 
the Tender document was heard in January 2022, and a decision by the 
Council of State is pending, estimated to conclude by mid-2023. In the 
case that the petition is accepted, the assignment of 5G spectrum rights 
will be declared invalid.

Universal Service Obligations (‘USO’) and Consumer Support 
Measures
Vodafone Greece has three active appeals against the NRA (‘EETT’). These 
are in relation to charges amounting to around €16.75 million. €9 million 
of this is imposed in relation to the provision of universal services by 
operator OTE for the period of 2010 through to 2011. Vodafone Greece 
has appealed these costs, with the hearing due in November 2023. 
The remaining €7.75 million has been imposed on Vodafone Greece due 
to a decision of EETT on the USO net costs for the period of 2012-2016. 
Vodafone Greece also appealed these costs, and a final decision is 
expected by the end of 2023. 

Similarly, Vodafone Portugal continues to challenge payment notices 
totalling €34.8 million issued by ANACOM regarding 2012 to 2014 
extraordinary compensation of USO costs.

In Czech Republic, based on the results of a public tender announced 
by CTU in December 2022, Vodafone Czech Republic became one of 
the universal service providers of subsidy (up to CZK 200 per month) to 
people with certain social needs. The subsidy will be provided by the state 
through designated service providers. The obligation to provide the 
subsidy is valid from 1 January 2023 until 31 December 2025.

In relation to consumer customer relations, in Spain, there is a Bill pending 
that will introduce new requirements around the provision of customer 
care and managing customer complaints, and compensation. The text 
of the Bill was approved by the Government on 31 May 2022, and it is 
expected to be fully approved by end of 2023. 

Networks
In Czech Republic, in March 2022, Vodafone Czech Republic and 
T-Mobile Czech Republic announced a project for joint deployment of 
fibre infrastructure, with the details of the process now being finalised.

Additionally, in Greece, approval for the 5G extension of the existing 4G 
network sharing agreement between Vodafone Greece and Nova/Wind 
Hellas is pending with EETT since August 2021. EETT requested both 
MNOs for additional data, which was submitted by Vodafone in February 
2023. A final decision is expected by July 2023.

In relation to network security, in Spain, the Government adopted their 
Cybersecurity Law in March 2022. The law introduces the concept of 
high-risk suppliers (‘HRS’) and creates a new framework: (i) for identifying 
HRS; (ii) limiting the use of HRS in both the Core and the Access networks; 
and (iii) for 5G operators to develop a risk assessment on their networks, 
and a vendor diversification strategy. No supplier has been identified 
as ‘high risk’ so far. 

Roaming
Following the successful implementation of the RLAH regime between 
the ‘West Balkans 6’ (‘WB6’) countries (Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, 
Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia) which from July 2021 has removed roaming 
surcharge rates between these countries, the Regional Cooperation 
Council has started the discussions to extend roaming reduction tariffs 
between the EU and WB6. 

Access
In Portugal, in June 2022, ANACOM published its final decision regarding 
the review of pricing of the Reference Duct Access Offer (‘RDAO’) and 
Reference Poles Access Offer (‘RPAO’) provided by the incumbent, MEO. 
ANACOM’s decision is based on evidence that action was needed in order 
to ensure cost orientation of prices applicable to said infrastructure. The 
decision was retrospectively applicable as of 15 February 2022 and 
reduced RDAO’s monthly fees by 35% and RPAO’s monthly fees by 20%.

Additionally, in Greece, the EETT issued its final decision on wholesale 
access markets in February 2023. In general, the EETT has maintained the 
majority of the remedies, given the incumbent (‘OTE’) still has significant 
market power (‘SMP’) in these markets. However, it has enhanced access 
to passive infrastructure. In addition, for FTTH services, whilst it will retain 
cost orientation obligations, it will lift the margin squeeze obligations on 
OTE and allow OTE to provide volume discounts. 

In Czech Republic, in September 2021, the CTU published a draft market 
analysis of the mobile wholesale access market, proposing to impose 
regulation on the wholesale price for mobile voice, SMS and data. The 
CTU notified these draft measures to the EC, but the EC issued its decision 
in February 2022, stating that the three criteria test was not met, and 
ex-ante regulation based on a joint SMP finding was unjustified, and 
therefore requested the CTU to withdraw the proposals. On 17 August 
2022, the CTU published an amended draft market analysis for public 
consultation. After the consultation process, the CTU notified draft 
measures to the EC in December 2022. In January 2023, the EC opened 
an in-depth investigation into the notified measures, which concluded on 
24 March 2023, with the EC adopting a decision requiring the CTU to 
withdraw its proposed draft measure. The Commission’s decision means 
that CTU cannot adopt its draft measure as notified.

Other Africa and Middle East: Democratic Republic 
of the Congo (DRC); Tanzania; Mozambique; Lesotho; 
Turkey; Egypt. 
Devices and registration
In Tanzania, the NRA (‘TCRA’) issued regulations that introduce a 
biometric registration requirement for SIMs, and restrict the number of 
SIMs a customer may own. The TCRA has directed disconnection of 
unverified SIMs in this category by 13 February 2023. Vodacom Tanzania 
consequently disconnected unverified customers as directed, and is now 
engaging with TCRA and customers to facilitate verification and 
re-activation, including through a self-verification process that has been 
approved by TCRA. 

Similarly, in Lesotho, the Minister of Communication introduced new SIM 
Registration regulations, which must be complied with by 24 June 2023. 
The regulations require the operator to enact biometric registration, 
establish a central database with the Communications Authority, 
re-register SIMs with a six-month timeline and enforce penalties of Maloti 
5k per non-compliant SIM card. 

Spectrum
In Lesotho, Vodacom Lesotho had extended its right to use 3500MHz trial 
5G spectrum up to 31 March 2022 when it vacated the spectrum bands 
upon expiry of these rights of use. Vodacom Lesotho is still engaging with 
the authorities to convert the trial licence to a permanent licence, which 
is under consideration by the NRA (‘LCA’).

In Mozambique, Vodacom Mozambique is seeking to extend the rights 
to use spectrum that was temporarily assigned to it during COVID-19. 
Vodacom Mozambique entered discussions with the NRA (‘ARECOM’) 
to acquire this spectrum as a permanent licence. The negotiations 
concluded in January 2023, whereby ARECOM has accepted Vodacom 
Mozambique’s offer of US$12.5 million for three bands, namely: acquire 
the 1800MHz and 2100MHz, coupled with 900MHz based on a 
staggered payment plan over five years, and subject to a down payment 
of US$40 million.

In Turkey, in April 2023, the NRA (BTK) issued a decision providing a 
six-year extension to the GSM Concession Agreement (2G/900MHz 
licence) which was due to expire in April 2023. The extension fee for 
Vodafone Turkey is €120m (+18% VAT).

In Tanzania, the TCRA convened a spectrum auction on 11 October 2022. 
Vodacom Tanzania participated in the auction and successfully acquired 
licences for spectrum in the 700MHz, 2300MHz and 2600MHz bands. 
Additionally in Tanzania, on 1 September 2022, Vodacom Tanzania 
successfully launched its 5G network using the new 3.5GHz frequencies.

Regulatory and legal disputes and fines
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (‘DRC’), Vodacom DRC are in 
ongoing negotiations with the NRA (‘ARPTC’) in relation to new regulatory 
fees that were first introduced in in March 2022. On 22 October 2022, the 
MNOs (including Vodacom DRC), Minister of Communications and ARPTC 
reached an agreement and signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
(‘MoU’) on the new regulatory fees, setting out revised fees and modality 
of payment. The MoU also provides for resolution of any pending fines 
and legal actions in this regard. Execution of each party’s obligations 
under the MoU is ongoing.

In Tanzania, the TCRA found that Vodacom Tanzania had failed to comply 
with regulatory QoS targets, mostly in the Zanzibar region, and has 
ordered Vodacom Tanzania to execute network improvement, with threat 
of fines if it fails to comply.

In Tanzania, the Finance Act 2021 introduced a mobile money levy which 
charged a rate of TZ10 to TZ10,000 for the use of mobile money services. 
However, the Minister of Finance has since reduced the original levy by 
60% and carved out transfers from a bank account to a mobile money 
account, and transfers between users’ own bank or mobile accounts. 
There is further ongoing dialogue between the mobile operators’ industry 
association and the Ministry of Finance on the possibility of eliminating 
the levy completely. 

In Lesotho, the LCA issued a penalty of M134 million to Vodacom 
Lesotho on grounds that its statutory auditor was not independent. 
Vodacom Lesotho has appealed the fine to the Court and has ultimately 
agreed to settle with the LCA. The Court issued an order of settlement of 
the matter, in terms of which the Court inter alia ordered Vodacom 
Lesotho to pay a total of M4 million to LCA (with M2 million payable by 
the end of November 2022, and the remaining M2 million payable within 
two years). This matter is now closed.

In Turkey, in October 2021, the ICTA introduced a margin squeeze test 
on wholesale reference offers. Subsequently on 1 June 2022, ICTA 
permitted a price increase of 67% for Bitstream Wholesale Access Costs, 
to account for the high inflationary environment. Vodafone Turkey then 
requested a margin squeeze test from ICTA against the incumbent 
(Türk Telekom), which then increased its fixed broadband retail tariffs. 

Additionally, the ICTA has not finalised Türk Telekom’s Reference 
Offer revision process for two years; therefore, regulated fibre access 
model and revisions for wholesale service level agreements (‘SLAs’) 
are still expected. 

In Tanzania, the TCRA launched a study to update the Interconnection 
Rates Determination No.5/2017 to determine rates for termination of 
domestic traffic on mobile networks. The final rate derived from the study, 
once completed, shall apply retrospectively from 1 January 2023, up to 
31 December 2028.

In Egypt, Vodafone Egypt is in the process of shutting down 3G 
technology by end of 2026. The NRA (‘NTRA’) will define an industry 
3G shutdown roadmap in line with Vodafone Egypt’s own roadmap.

1.  All: Single (or unpaired) blocks of spectrum are used for asymmetric data (non-voice) use; block quantity has been rounded to the nearest whole number.
2.  Germany: The allocation of 2.1GHz will change to the following: At present we have 2x15 MHz (2040) and 2x5 (2025); in January 2026 will have 2x20 MHz (2040).
3.  Multiple: Blocks within the same spectrum band but with different licence expiry dates are separately identified.
4.  UK: All UK spectrum licences are perpetual so any dates given are the ones from which licence fees become payable, and where no date is given this means that licence fees already apply.
5.  UK: Currently in the transition period of the 3.4-3.8 GHz defragmentation deal with Virgin Media O2. Once the transition is completed in 2025, Vodafone will have 90 MHz with an expiry date of 2038.
6.  Spain: The initial term of the licence is 20 years, with the option to renew the licence for an additional 20 years as long as the licence conditions have been met.
7.  Ireland: 105 MHz in cities, 85 MHz in regions.
8.  Romania: 100 MHz 3.5 GHz licence to start upon expiry of the original 40 MHz licence.
9.  Czech Republic: Early extension to the 2.1 GHz licence achieved in 2022, extending the term of the original licence from 2025 to 2041.
10. Czech Republic: Includes 40 MHz acquired from PODA, with same licence duration as the other 60 MHz.
11. Albania: As part of the merger remedies from the ONE-ALBtelecom merger, Vodafone has agreed to acquire the following spectrum from the merged entity effective 1 May 2023: 2x4.5 MHz of 1800 MHz
