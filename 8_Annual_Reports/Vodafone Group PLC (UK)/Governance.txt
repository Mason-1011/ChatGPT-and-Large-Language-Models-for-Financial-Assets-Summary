Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

TCFD disclosure

We recognise that climate change poses a 

number of physical (i.e. extreme weather events) 

and transition-related (i.e. related to moving to a 

greener economy) risks and opportunities for our 

business. As part of our commitment to operate 

ethically and sustainably, we strive to understand 

climate-related risks and opportunities and embed 

responses to these into our business strategy and 

operations. We have been aligning our internal 

processes with the recommendations of the 

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

(‘TCFD’) and will continue to enhance our 

policies, processes and reporting with respect 

to the TCFD recommendations. Our progress 

is summarised in this section.

TCFD recommendations

For the year ending 31 March 2023, we are consistent with 10 out of 11 

TCFD recommendations. There is one recommendation with which we 

are currently partially consistent:

Metrics and targets (physical risks): We measure and have set 

ambitious targets for reducing our carbon emissions. We also have 

metrics in place to measure our energy use, which is one underlying 

factor in our exposure to transition risk. As a measure of the climate 

opportunity associated with developing and deploying products to help 

society decarbonise, we also report annually on the carbon emissions 

avoided through the use of green digital solutions. This year, we also 

began measuring our physical risk exposure and management based 

on the number of infrastructure assets that are at high or very high risk 

of climate impacts such as extreme weather events. Whilst these are 

important steps forward on our climate-related risk disclosure journey, 

we recognise that we do not yet have metrics and targets in place to 

measure our full suite of climate risks.

Our disclosure this year improves upon our position in 2022, when we 

were only consistent with eight out of 11 recommendations. In this 

year’s report, we are pleased to include further detail on the impact 

of climate-related risks and opportunities on our business strategy and 

financial planning, and a quantitative measure of the number of assets 

at high or very high risk of physical climate change. As industry practices 

evolve and our internal programme matures, we aim to address the 

remaining gaps in our climate-related risk management and reporting 

approach over the next three years. 

TCFD reporting

As with last year’s disclosure, we have once again published our 

comprehensive TCFD overview in a standalone report. This enables us 

to provide more detailed information for investors and other interested 

stakeholders in a more accessible format.

Governance

Our strategy is approved by the Board which has reviewed Vodafone’s 

purpose and Planet commitments to reduce our environmental impact, 

such as reaching ‘net zero’ emissions across our full value chain (Scope 1, 

2 and 3) by 2040. The Board’s Audit and Risk Committee has oversight 

of our climate-related risks and opportunities. In addition, the ESG 

Committee provides oversight of the broader ESG strategy.

Read more about the ESG Committee  

on pages 83 to 84

The Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer, a member of the 

Executive Committee, is the sponsor for the Planet agenda as part of our 

purpose-led strategy and has overall accountability for climate change 

action within the Group. This includes providing updates to the Board on 

the progress towards our climate-related goals. The Chief Network Officer 

is responsible for the overall management of the physical risks to Vodafone 

due to the nature of our business.

In addition, our Remuneration Policy incorporates our ESG priorities in 

the long-term incentive plan. For the 2023 award, the ESG measure under 

the long-term incentive plan includes an ambition on planet linked to 

our aim of reaching net zero for our own operations under Scope 1 

and 2 by 2030.

Read more about ESG measures in our long-term incentive 

plan on pages 93 to 106

TCFD recommendations

We have considered our ‘comply or explain’ obligation under the UK’s 

Financial Conduct Authority Listing Rules and have detailed in the

Strategy
This year, we once again conducted our annual exercise to refresh the 
assessment of the top climate-related risks and opportunities to ensure 
we are incorporating any change in climate trends or science, as well as 
new risks and opportunities. The exercise confirmed that the identified 
risks and opportunities remain largely unchanged from the previous 
assessment, although some require more attention in the short term due 
to the macroeconomic environment and volatility in the energy market.

Last year, we built on our previous climate scenario work and considered 
our resilience against key climate-related risks and opportunities. 
That work included mapping the current controls in place and the 
strength of those controls for each material risk and opportunity. 
Overall, we have controls in place for all identified key risks and this 
helps us build resilience against the potential impacts on the business.

Physical risks are assessed and considered throughout the critical 
stages of the asset lifecycle. Environmental risks are assessed ahead 
of the acquisition of buildings and network equipment. We have teams 
and processes dedicated to disaster recovery and business continuity. 
In addition, we mitigate the financial impact of physical risks through 
insurance and damage response.

Our broader Planet strategy, targets and external communications are 
designed to manage and mitigate the potential impacts of transition risks 
on the Group. We have specialist teams that monitor and drive progress 
to maintain and meet expectations from key stakeholders. This year, 
we took further steps to improve energy efficiency and limit exposure to 
energy market volatility as it is a key short-term risk. Similarly, harnessing 
our current climate and ESG strategy and monitoring market trends 
will enable us to also capture opportunities arising from the 
low-carbon transition.

Read more about how our products and services help 
our customers reduce their emissions on page 37

This year, we also conducted a scenario analysis focusing on the potential 
impact of physical climate-related risks on specific types of our 
infrastructure assets, with the aim of understanding how our infrastructure 
asset portfolio is expected to evolve in the long term under different 
climate change scenarios. This exercise will inform our longer-term 
resilience plans related to physical climate-related risks, such as damage 
to our infrastructure.

Risk management
We have aligned our climate-related risk management process with our 
overall risk management framework. Climate change was discussed and 
considered during the principal risk assessment process and it was once 
again placed on our risk watchlist.

Read more about our risk management framework  
on pages 51 to 52 and 56

To ensure a robust identification and assessment of climate-related risks 
and opportunities we use the following data sources:

 – Climate-change publications and data;
 – Guidance from the TCFD on potential risks and opportunities;
 – Previous year’s assessments; and
 – Key stakeholders’ inputs via a survey and targeted discussions.

We evaluate the materiality of the identified risks and opportunities by 
assessing their likelihood and impact using our global risk management 
framework. This process helps us determine the relative significance 
of the climate-related risks in relation to other risks.

Due to the nature of the topic, there are many teams across Vodafone 
that are responsible for managing climate-related risks and we have 
multiple processes and policies in place to ensure we are managing 
them effectively.

Metrics and targets
We use a wide variety of metrics to measure the current and potential 
impacts of climate-related risks. We have been measuring and reporting 
on energy and carbon emissions since 2001 and have been responding 
to CDP’s climate change questionnaire since 2010. Our main carbon 
emissions metrics are also subject to independent limited assurance. 
In addition, we have set a number of targets to manage climate-related 
risks and reduce our impact on the environment, such as reaching ‘net 
zero’ emissions across our full value chain (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2040 and 
purchasing 100% renewable electricity in all markets by 2025. Since July 
2021, our European network has been 100% powered by electricity from 
renewable sources.

investors.vodafone.com/esgaddendum

We constantly seek to refresh and improve our metrics and key risk 
indicators to better measure and manage climate-related risks and 
opportunities. We recognise that we need to mature further in this 
area as industry practices and better-quality data become available.

Read more about our existing environmental KPIs  
on pages 35 to 38

Material climate-related risks and opportunities
Physical risks:
 – Damage to infrastructure caused by increasing frequency and 

severity of extreme weather events, including wildfires, flooding, 
and storms

 – Interruption or reduction in the quality of services due to increased 

precipitation and extreme weather events

 – Supply chain disruption due to climate impacts on key suppliers
 – Increases in global temperatures leading to an increase in the 

consumption of energy for cooling

Transition risks:
 – Increasing stakeholder scrutiny over our environmental 

performance impacting revenue, market share and reputation

 – Rising price of energy (renewable and non-renewable)
 – Emerging carbon regulations and carbon taxation
 – Changing mandates and regulations over infrastructure 

energy efficiency

 – Third-party dependency impacting our ability to meet carbon 

targets and improve efficiencies

Opportunities:
 – Development of new product lines enabling customers to better 

manage climate-related impacts

 – Reduced costs through sustainable procurement

by conducting an annual performance review. 

Committee activities

To operate efficiently and to ensure matters are given the right level of focus, the Board delegates 
some of its responsibilities to its Committees. These provide focused oversight on: Board composition, 
performance, and succession planning; financial reporting, risk, internal processes and controls; 
remuneration practices; and environmental, sustainability and governance topics. 

Nominations and Governance Committee
In addition to keeping under review developments in corporate 
governance and the Company’s responses to them, the Nominations and 
Governance Committee makes recommendations to the Board about 
Board composition and ensures Board diversity and the necessary 
balance of skills. The Committee recognises the need to anticipate the 
skills and attributes that will be needed on the Board as the Company 
develops. A key focus for the Committee this year has been Board and 
Executive Committee composition. For the latter half of the year, the main 
activity has concerned succession planning for the Group Chief Executive.

Chair’s governance statement

We take seriously our commitment to strong and 
robust corporate governance

Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report for the year 
ended 31 March 2023 on behalf of the Board.

The year in review
This year, has again, been one of change and I am grateful to my fellow 
Directors, the executive team, and the people of Vodafone for their 
support, flexibility, and strong spirit throughout.

In spite of the challenges faced we have functioned well and have 
continued to take seriously our commitment to strong and robust 
corporate governance to support the creation of long-term sustainable 
value for the benefit of all our stakeholders.

This report provides details about the Board and an explanation of our 
individual roles and responsibilities as well as providing an insight into the 
activities of the Board and Committees over the year and how we seek to 
ensure the highest standards of corporate governance remain embedded 
throughout the Company, underpinning and supporting our business and 
the decisions we make.

Board succession
Executive Directors
During the year, the Board and Nominations and Governance Committee 
reviewed the future leadership of the Company and, as announced on 5 
December 2022, the Board agreed with Nick Read that he would step down 
as Group Chief Executive and as a Director of the Company on 31 
December 2022. I would like to thank Nick for his commitment and 
significant contribution to Vodafone as Group Chief Executive and 
throughout his career spanning more than two decades with the Company.

In addition to her role as Group Chief Financial Officer, Margherita Della 
Valle was appointed Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2023 
on an interim basis. The Board initiated a process with the support of Egon 
Zehnder, an independent external search firm, to find a permanent Group 
Chief Executive and on 27 April 2023, we announced the permanent 
appointment of Margherita Della Valle. The Board and I have been 
impressed with her pace and decisiveness to begin the necessary 
transformation of Vodafone. Tasked with accelerating the execution of 
the Company’s strategy to improve operational performance and deliver 
shareholder value the Board fully supports her. Margherita will also 
continue as Group Chief Financial Officer until an external search for 
a new Group Chief Financial Officer is complete.

Non-Executive Directors
The Board, together with the Nominations and Governance Committee, 
has continued to monitor the composition and skills matrix of the Board 
with a focus on succession planning for our Non-Executive Directors.

Last year we indicated several upcoming scheduled retirements from 
the Board and on 10 May 2023 we announced that Valerie Gooding, 
Sir Crispin Davis and Dame Clara Furse would not be seeking re-election 
at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). At the date of publication, 
Valerie Gooding has served more than nine years as a Director; however, 
she will remain on the Board until the conclusion of the 2023 AGM in 
order to allow for a gradual and smooth transition period of the Senior

Directors, Stephen Carter, Delphine Ernotte Cunci, Simon Segars and

Continued stakeholder engagement
We recognise that Vodafone’s success is dependent on the Board taking 
decisions for the benefit of our shareholders and in doing so having 
regard to all our stakeholders.

Throughout the year, I have interacted with institutional shareholders and 
engaged on topics such as the Company’s strategy, Board and Executive 
changes, and succession plans. I was delighted that as well as virtual 
meetings, we were able to host some meetings in person for the first time 
since the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board has also received updates on 
the investor perception study completed during the year.

The Board understands the importance of culture and setting the tone 
of the organisation from the top and embedding it throughout the Group. 
We refer to our culture as the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’. It is a key component 
for our strategic, organisational and digital transformation. The aim of our 
people strategy is to create an environment where growing never stops 
and everyone can truly belong, innovate, and fulfil their potential. We 
continue to hold quarterly ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ days for our employees, 
designed to provide dedicated space for personal growth, wellbeing and 
connection. The Board receives regular updates on employee engagement 
and the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’, which enables it to make informed 
decisions where appropriate.

The year ahead
On 10 May 2023, the Board approved the creation of a Technology 
Committee as a new Board Committee. Once established, during the 
course of this year, the Committee will oversee the technology strategy 
and how it supports the overall Company strategy. Further information 
on this Committee will be shared in next year’s report. 

A key focus for myself and the Board will be completing the appointment 
process for a new Group Chief Financial Officer and supporting that 
individual as they step into the role alongside Margherita Della Valle.

In addition, the Board will continue to drive for better returns for 
shareholders and will monitor the Company’s progress on the execution 
of Vodafone’s strategy focusing on Customers, Simplicity and Growth. The 
Board will keep the Group’s strategy under review, adapting it to anticipate

The year in review

This year, has again, been one of change and I am grateful to my fellow 

Directors, the executive team, and the people of Vodafone for their 

support, flexibility, and strong spirit throughout.

In spite of the challenges faced we have functioned well and have 

continued to take seriously our commitment to strong and robust 

corporate governance to support the creation of long-term sustainable 

value for the benefit of all our stakeholders.

This report provides details about the Board and an explanation of our 

individual roles and responsibilities as well as providing an insight into the 

activities of the Board and Committees over the year and how we seek to 

ensure the highest standards of corporate governance remain embedded 

throughout the Company, underpinning and supporting our business and 

the decisions we make.

Board succession

Executive Directors

During the year, the Board and Nominations and Governance Committee 

reviewed the future leadership of the Company and, as announced on 5 

December 2022, the Board agreed with Nick Read that he would step down 

as Group Chief Executive and as a Director of the Company on 31 

December 2022. I would like to thank Nick for his commitment and 

significant contribution to Vodafone as Group Chief Executive and 

In addition to her role as Group Chief Financial Officer, Margherita Della 

Valle was appointed Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2023 

on an interim basis. The Board initiated a process with the support of Egon 

Zehnder, an independent external search firm, to find a permanent Group 

Chief Executive and on 27 April 2023, we announced the permanent 

appointment of Margherita Della Valle. The Board and I have been 

impressed with her pace and decisiveness to begin the necessary 

transformation of Vodafone. Tasked with accelerating the execution of 

the Company’s strategy to improve operational performance and deliver 

shareholder value the Board fully supports her. Margherita will also 

continue as Group Chief Financial Officer until an external search for 

a new Group Chief Financial Officer is complete.

Non-Executive Directors

The Board, together with the Nominations and Governance Committee, 

has continued to monitor the composition and skills matrix of the Board 

with a focus on succession planning for our Non-Executive Directors.

Last year we indicated several upcoming scheduled retirements from 

the Board and on 10 May 2023 we announced that Valerie Gooding, 

Sir Crispin Davis and Dame Clara Furse would not be seeking re-election 

at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). At the date of publication, 

Valerie Gooding has served more than nine years as a Director; however, 

she will remain on the Board until the conclusion of the 2023 AGM in 

order to allow for a gradual and smooth transition period of the Senior 

Independent Director role to David Nish, Remuneration Committee Chair 

role to Amparo Moraleda and Workforce Engagement Lead roles to 

Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Christine Ramon. Following evaluation, 

Valerie is still considered independent.

Our Company purpose, values and culture 

Purpose
At Vodafone, our purpose is to connect for a better future by enabling 
inclusive and sustainable digital societies and it is supported by our three 
purpose pillars: Digital Society, Inclusion for All and Planet. Our purpose 
is championed by our Board, which is collectively responsible for the 
oversight and long-term success of the Company. It is aligned with our 
culture and strategy, placed at the forefront of our decision-making and 
strategy development, and the Board considers how the initiatives 
progressed by management throughout the year have advanced our 
purpose. Board oversight ensures that continued product development 
realises our ambition to connect for a better future.

Read more about our purpose  
on pages 28-39

Strategy
The Board monitors the Company’s progress against established strategic 
objectives and performance against competitors. Board meetings are 
planned with reference to the Company’s strategic priorities and meeting 
agendas are constructed to deliver information at appropriate junctures 
and from a broad range of management, to enable the Board to 
effectively review and challenge.

Read more about the new roadmap for Vodafone 
on page 7

Governance
The Board ensures the highest standard of corporate governance 
is maintained by regularly reviewing developments in governance 
best practice and ensuring these are adopted by the Company.

The Board dedicated time during the year to thoroughly consider the 
independence and time commitment of all Directors, the arrangements 
in place to monitor conflicts of interest, as well as evaluating the 
effectiveness of the Board and each of the Directors.

All Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary, who 
is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters and 
ensuring the Board has access to the necessary policies, processes and 
resources required to operate efficiently and effectively.

Read more about our governance structure and roles 
and responsibilities on pages 68-70

Values and culture
The Board has a critical role in setting the tone of our organisation and 
championing the behaviours we expect to see throughout the Group. 
The ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ aligns with our purpose and strategy, which 
ultimately leads to a more motivated and productive workforce. 
The Board has continued to influence and monitor culture throughout 
the year and receives regular updates on the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ 
initiatives, including ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ Days, the two Spirit Beat surveys 
and the additional global pulse survey.

The cultural climate in Vodafone is measured through a number of 
mechanisms including policy and compliance processes, internal audit, 
and formal and informal channels for employees to raise concerns. 
The latter includes our bi-annual people survey and our whistleblowing 
programme, Speak Up, which is also available to the contractors and 
suppliers working with us. A series of communication materials were 
shared in April through ‘Workplace’, our internal digital platform, and 
other channels to address common misconceptions and encourage 
more employees to come forward with experiences and/or observations 
of those breaching the code of conduct. The Board is apprised of any 
material whistleblowing incidents.

Alongside these mechanisms, the Board remains committed to 
engagement with the workforce and these opportunities continue to 
shape how the Board influences and understands the Company’s culture.

Employee engagement
Given the geographical size and complexity of our business, we utilise 
several employee engagement methods and communication channels 
between the Board, the Executive Committee, and our workforce to 
enable meaningful engagement.

The Board receives regular updates including an annual written report 
from Valerie Gooding, the designated Workforce Engagement Lead, 
detailing activities undertaken during the year to engage with employees.

Examples of these initiatives include:

Workforce Engagement Lead attendance at Employee Forums
The Board was apprised of feedback from Valerie Gooding’s attendance 
at Employee Forums, namely the European Employee Consultative 
Committee. It is evident from these meetings that employee delegates 
continue to appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to a Board 
member. Through these means we understand that our people are 
engaged and interested in business strategy, mergers & acquisitions 
(‘M&A’) activity and opportunities for personal development.

Workplace communications
‘Workplace’ is our internal digital platform that allows employees to start 
conversations and themed groups on topics of their choice. The Executive 
Committee and Internal Communications team regularly post relevant 
business updates on the platform, with employees able to directly 
respond with views and questions. Key highlights in the year include:

Board activities and principal decisions
Our Board is responsible for the overall leadership of 
the Group and throughout the year, Board activities and 
discussion have continued to focus on the Company’s 
strategic priorities. The Board oversees the Company’s 
strategic direction and supports the executive 
management with its delivery of the strategy within a 
transparent governance framework. Alongside the 
strategic priorities, the Board has considered topics 
including executive succession, the business plan, 
financial performance, digital and technology, and 
governance. Further detail on these topics is set 
out below.

Digital and IT strategy
The Board was kept updated on the progress of One Technology 
following its formation 18 months ago. As at September 2022, Vodafone 
led in 13 out of 15 categories of Gartner’s IT functionality index and a key 
aim of the project was to move away from big IT transformation projects 
and focus on investing in engineering, insourcing and modernisation. 
The Chief Information Officers and Chief Technology Officers in each 
local market were made members of their company’s executive team 
and many were given additional domain roles across the Group.

Business plan and financial performance
Business plan
In the year, the Board discussed and approved the business plan.

Financial performance
The Board received regular updates on the financial performance of the 
Group. This year the Board reviewed the Group trading performance and 
financial forecast against the backdrop of rising energy prices, increased 
wage costs due to inflation, and the effect of the war in Ukraine. 
The Board also considered the Group’s debt position and agreed to 
reduce its debt in the long term. In March 2023, the Board received and 
approved the budget and long range plan.

Dividend
The decision to approve the dividend was supported by a robust 
assessment of the position, performance and viability of the business 
carried out by management. The Board was mindful that the Directors 
had continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and accounts and was also cognisant of available reserves to 
support the payment of the dividend.

On 15 November 2022, we announced an interim dividend of 4.50 
eurocents per share which was paid on 3 February 2023. We have 
recommended a final dividend of 4.50 eurocents per share to be paid 
on 4 August 2023. This was consistent with dividends declared during 
FY22 and the expectations of our shareholders.

Investor relations
The Board received regular updates on market share information and 
was kept updated on the results of an investor perception study. 
Annual roadshow feedback was also provided during the year.

Read more about how the Board engaged with investors  
during the year on page 12

Strategy and business developments
Strategy remained a key focus throughout the year. In addition to the 
usual meetings, the Board attended a strategy offsite session in South 
Africa. The deep-dive session focused on reviewing the Company’s 
portfolio and agreeing key priorities for the Company.

UK
On 3 October 2022, we confirmed that discussions were taking place 
with CK Hutchinson Holdings in relation to a possible combination of 
Vodafone UK and Three UK. The potential transaction is expected to bring 
benefits to customers through competitively priced access to a reliable, 
high-quality and secure 5G network throughout the UK.

Vodafone Hungary
This year the Board discussed the proposed sale of Vodafone Hungary 
and on 31 January 2023, we announced that Vodafone Group Plc had 
completed the sale of Vodafone Hungary to 4iG Public Limited Company 
and Corvinus Zrt. Proceeds from the sale were used for deleveraging.

Vodafone Egypt
The Board considered the growth plans for the Group and on 13 
December 2022 we announced that Vodafone Group Plc had completed 
the transfer of its 55% shareholding in Vodafone Egypt to Vodacom (its 
African subsidiary). This transfer simplifies the management of Vodafone’s 
African assets, along with the Group’s structure, and supports Vodacom 
and Vodafone Egypt for future growth.

Key stakeholders are considered in the decision-
making process in accordance with section 172 
of the Companies Act 2006.

Read more about Vodafone’s key stakeholders and how the 
Board has engaged with them during the year on pages 10-12

Customers
Information in relation to the evolving needs of customers is regularly 
provided to the Board by the Executive Committee members and 
senior managers.

Cost of living crisis
The Board discussed pricing trends in Europe and considered the 
Company’s cost of living initiative. The initiative consisted of three elements: 
social or low cost tariffs in all markets; extra measures to ensure consumers 
and small businesses were supported; and leveraging technology and 
digital services to help customers reduce their energy usage.

Customer experience
In March 2023, the Board received a detailed analysis of customer satisfaction 
and experience in markets across the Group. Updates were provided on new 
tools to generate more actionable insights and the implementation of more 
impactful processes to improve customer experience. Noting the current pain 
points, the Board considered the planned actions for each market during the 
course of the next financial year.

Vodafone Germany
The Board received regular updates on customer trends in Germany 
throughout the year. The Board considered the performance of the 
network, the impact of shop closures, changes in regulation and the 
difficulties experienced with the rollout of a new IT system. Focus was 
also given to improving customer service.

Digital and technology
New technology operating model
The Board received an update following the transition to a new technology 
operating model. The technology organisation changed from one per 
country to a common European organisation based on scaled domains and 
sub domains. The main aim of the model was to enable faster decision-
making. Not only have significant cost savings been achieved, but 
operational performance has improved following the implementation. 
The employee Technology Spirit survey results had also improved during 
the transition following improvements to career development and the 
reputation of Vodafone as an employer of technologists.

The Board considered the positive impact, along with improvements to 
innovation and customer experience.

strategic priority. In November 2022, we announced that the Board had 
taken the decision to enter a co-control partnership with Global 
Infrastructure Partners and KKR for Vantage Towers. The partnership is 
with long-term investors with significant expertise in digital infrastructure

Key steps to date

In accordance with section 172 of the Companies Act, the Board, 
with the support of an external legal adviser, conducted a deep-dive 
analysis to consider stakeholder interests and whether the Vantage 
Towers transaction (and which of the proposed counterparts) was 
in the best interests of the Company’s members as a whole.

The following factors were taken into consideration by the Board in its 
analysis and decision-making:

 – the respective valuations;
 – the terms proposed by each bid;
 – agreement changes;
 – funding and structure;
 – protection for risks in relation to minority shareholders;
 – regulatory, legal and governance considerations; and

The Board also discussed market perception and the need for 
effective communication with investors.

transaction was in the best interests of the Company.

reputation has continued to improve across multiple markets and 

stakeholders and is now ahead of the sector average. Stakeholder 

awareness of the Company’s ESG commitments and initiatives was 

also considered.

 – Internal controls and assessment of the viability statement: 

the Board receives at least an annual update from the Audit and Risk 

Committee following its review of the effectiveness of the Group’s 

system of internal controls, including risk management. Following 

recommendation from the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board 

approved the internal controls and viability statement disclosures for 

the Annual Report.

The Board will continue to focus on the strategic priorities for  

the year and the appointment and onboarding of a permanent 

Chief Financial Officer.

CEO Succession

On 27 April 2023, the Company announced the appointment of 

Margherita Della Valle as Group Chief Executive, following a rigorous 

Reference, the Nominations and Governance Committee led on the 

succession process and received regular updates.

Board effectiveness and improving our performance
The Board recognises that it needs to continually 
monitor and improve its performance. Our annual 
performance evaluation provides the opportunity 
for the Board and its Committees to consider and 
reflect on the effectiveness of its activities, the 
quality of its decision-making, and the collective 
contribution made by each Board member.

Progress against actions identified following the 2022 external 
evaluation
Action

The composition, performance and effectiveness of each of the Board 
Committees was also evaluated and the Committee members agreed 
that each Committee was functioning effectively.

Progress made

Refresh the composition of the 
Board to bring on more Directors 
with technology and/or 
telecommunications sector 
experience. 

Four new Non-Executive 
Directors have been appointed 
to the Board in FY23, each 
bringing extensive technology 
and telecommunications 
experience. 

Devote more time to strategy 
sessions to enhance free-flowing 
discussions and allow for 
additional topics to be discussed 
where required. 

Topics requiring additional 
deep-dives could be bolstered by 
using smaller groups of the Board 
with specific expertise in the 
matter.

The Board held several strategic 
deep-dive sessions during the 
year to enhance discussions.

A Board sub-committee has 
been set up to consider merger 
and acquisition transactions. 

Process undertaken for our Board evaluation
In accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommendations and following two consecutive years of externally 
facilitated Board evaluations, the 2023 Board evaluation was 
conducted internally.

Evaluation process
The internal evaluation was led by the Chair and supported by the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary. The structure of the evaluation 
was agreed and the objectives of the review were to provide an 
assessment of Vodafone Group’s Board effectiveness and governance, 
including the effectiveness of its Committees.

A tailored Board questionnaire was compiled to gather and distil feedback 
on topics including composition, diversity and how effectively members 
worked together to achieve objectives. The Directors’ responses were 
collated and a paper summarising the findings was presented to the 
Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board at the March 
2023 meetings.

Evaluation findings
The Board discussed the findings from the evaluation and was 
encouraged by the strengths identified. In particular, the Board 
agreed that:

 – there has been effective leadership throughout the year and the Chair 

continued to actively encourage input from all Board members, 
facilitating open discussion and constructive challenge;

 – the conduct of the meetings and the materials provided supported the 
Board in discharging its responsibilities and ensuring that meetings ran 
effectively and efficiently; and

 – following the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors, good 

progress has been made in increasing sector experience and skills on 
the Board, which in turn has supported strategic discussion and 
decision-making.

The Board also identified areas in which it could improve. Particular areas 
of focus for the coming year include:

 – Leadership: succession planning, including securing and on-boarding 

an outstanding Chief Financial Officer;

 – Operational Performance: prioritising time spent on the key strategic 

pillars of customer satisfaction, simplification and growth; and 

 – Technology: increasing the Board’s focus on technology strategy and 

capital allocation.

Nominations and Governance Committee
The Nominations and Governance Committee (the 
‘Committee’) continues to monitor the composition, 
structure and size of the Board and its Committees 
to ensure that there is an appropriate balance 
of skills, knowledge, experience, and diversity so 
that responsibilities can be discharged effectively. 
The Committee oversees all matters relating to 
corporate governance and succession planning and 
makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate.

The Committee has also considered the succession plans for the roles 
of Senior Independent Director, Workforce Engagement Lead and Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee in line with the expected retirement of 
Valerie Gooding this year, following nine years’ service to the Board. With 
effect from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, David Nish will be appointed 
as Senior Independent Director, Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Christine 
Ramon will be appointed Workforce Engagement Leads, and Amparo 
Moraleda will be appointed Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 

The Committee is confident that the Board currently has the 
necessary mix of skills and experience to contribute to the Company’s 
strategic objectives.

Read more about the details of the length of tenure of each 
Director and a summary of the skills and experience of the 
Non-Executive Directors on pages 60 and 65-67

Appointment process for Non-Executive Directors
To begin the appointment process, the Company engages with an 
external search consultancy which it provides with a search specification. 
The consultancy then proposes a list of individuals with a diverse range 
of backgrounds and characteristics. Capturing the clear benefits of 
diversity of background and opinion, and identifying candidates with the 
requisite experience and capabilities, is at the forefront of this search. 
The shortlisted candidates are interviewed by the Committee members 
and they meet with the Group Chief Executive. A recommendation is 
made to the Board on the chosen candidate. Once a candidate is selected, 
appointment terms are drafted and agreed with the selected candidate.

Executive Committee changes, succession planning and talent 
pipeline
The Committee receives regular updates on succession planning and 
changes to the membership of the Executive Committee. This year, 
the Committee has discussed succession plans for executives below 
Board level.

Following Nick Read stepping down from his role as Group Chief 
Executive in December 2022, Margherita Della Valle was appointed as 
Group Chief Executive on an interim basis with effect from 1 January 
2023, whilst continuing her role as Group Chief Financial Officer. We are 
grateful to Nick Read for his significant commitment and contribution to 
Vodafone during his career. The Board announced on 27 April 2023, 
following a rigorous internal and external search, that Margherita was 
appointed as the permanent Group Chief Executive. She will also continue 
as Group Chief Financial Officer until an external search for a new Group 
Chief Financial Officer is complete.

During the year the Committee discussed succession planning for a 
new Group Chief Technology Officer and Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary following the respective retirements of Johan 
Wibergh on 31 December 2022 and Rosemary Martin on 1 March 2023. 
Both individuals also stepped down from the Executive Committee on 
their respective retirement dates. 

Following the recruitment process, we were pleased to announce the 
appointment of Maaike de Bie as Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary with effect from 1 March 2023. Maaike also joined the 
Executive Committee with effect from the same date. With almost 30 
years of experience, Maaike is an experienced international lawyer and 
is dual qualified in both the US and UK. She has held numerous senior 
roles in a variety of sectors, including at EY LLP, General Electric and the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development LLP. Maaike has 
also previously served as General Counsel and Company Secretary 
of easyJet plc and Royal Mail plc.

The Committee is comprised solely of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Committee had four scheduled meetings during the year 
and additional ad hoc meetings as required. The attendance at Committee 
meetings can be found on page 60.

Letter from Committee Chair
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Nominations and 
Governance Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2023.

Board composition and succession planning
The main areas of focus for the Committee this year have been Board 
and Executive Committee composition and succession planning, with 
a continued focus on the appointment of Non-Executive Directors with 
telecommunications, technology, and e-commerce expertise, as well as 
the process to identify a permanent Group Chief Executive.

The Committee monitors the length of tenure and the skills of the 
Non-Executive Directors to assist with succession planning. We reported 
last year that there were several upcoming scheduled retirements from 
the Board and on 10 May 2023 we announced that Sir Crispin Davis, 
Dame Clara Furse and Valerie Gooding would not be seeking re-election 
at the 2023 AGM.

In anticipation of these scheduled departures, the Committee focused 
on finding suitable Non-Executive Director successors to further enhance 
the Board’s experience and capabilities in the telecommunications and 
technology sectors. MWM Consulting, an independent external search firm, 
was appointed to support this process. Following shareholder approval at 
the Annual General Meeting on 26 July 2022, Stephen Carter, Delphine 
Ernotte Cunci and Simon Segars were appointed as Non-Executive 
Directors, each bringing a broad range of experience and expertise to the 
Board. In November 2022, we also announced the appointment of Christine 
Ramon who joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 14 November 
2022. Christine brings extensive financial and strategic experience, along 
with telecommunications expertise. She also has comprehensive African 
market experience that will support the strategic aims of the Group and 
I am delighted to welcome her to Vodafone’s Board.

In light of these Board changes and having reviewed the composition 
of the Board Committees, we announced that with effect from 8 
November 2022, Stephen Carter became a member of the Nominations 
and Governance Committee, Delphine Ernotte Cunci a member of 
the Remuneration Committee and Simon Segars a member of the ESG 
Committee. Christine Ramon was appointed a member of the Audit 
and Risk Committee with effect from 28 March 2023.

We were delighted to announce the appointment of Scott Petty as Group

Governance
The Committee continues to review action taken to comply with 
the Code and other legal and regulatory obligations during the year. 
The Committee receives regular governance updates and is satisfied that 
Vodafone has complied with the Code in full during the year.

Independence
In accordance with the Code, the independence of all the Non-Executive 
Directors was considered by the Committee. At the date of publication, 
Valerie Gooding has served more than nine years as a director; however, 
she will remain on the Board until the conclusion of the 2023 AGM in 
order to allow for a gradual and smooth transition period of the Senior 
Independent Director, Workforce Engagement Leads and Remuneration 
Committee Chair roles. Following evaluation, all Non-Executive Directors 
are considered independent, and they continue to make independent 
contributions and effectively challenge management.

All Non-Executive Directors have submitted themselves for election or 
re-election, as applicable, at the 2023 AGM, other than Sir Crispin Davis, 
Dame Clara Furse and Valerie Gooding who will retire from the Board at 
the conclusion of the 2023 AGM as announced on 10 May 2023.

The Executive Directors’ service contracts and Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointment letters are available for inspection at our registered office 
and at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.

Conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 provides that directors have a duty to avoid a 
situation in which they have or may have a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts or might conflict with the interests of the Company. This duty is 
in addition to the existing duty owed to the Company to disclose to the 
Board any interest in a transaction or arrangement under consideration 
by the Company.

Our Directors must report any changes to their commitments to the 
Board, immediately notify the Company of actual or potential conflicts 
or a change in circumstances relating to an existing authorisation and 
complete an annual conflicts questionnaire. Any conflicts or potential 
conflicts identified are considered and, where appropriate, authorised 
by the Board in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
A register of authorised conflicts is also reviewed periodically.

The Committee and the Board are satisfied that the external 
commitments of the Directors do not conflict with their duties and 
commitments as Directors of the Company. The Committee is 
comfortable that it has adequate measures in place to manage and 
mitigate any actual or potential conflicts of interests that may arise 
in the future.

Time commitment
In accordance with the Code, the Committee actively reviews the time 
commitments of the Board. All Directors are engaged in providing their 
external commitments to establish that they have sufficient time to meet 
their Board responsibilities. The Committee is satisfied that the Board does 
meet this requirement and all Directors provide constructive challenge, 
strategic guidance and hold management to account.

Board evaluation
In accordance with the Code, Vodafone conducts an annual evaluation of 
Board and Board Committee performance, which every Director engages 
in, and which is facilitated by an independent third party at least once 
every three years. This year, an internal evaluation of the performance 
of the Board and Committees took place led by the Chair, with support 
from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary.

review on page 73

Roles and responsibilities

set out the role and responsibilities of the Committee in further detail 
and were reviewed in March 2023.

Diversity
The Board Diversity Policy reinforces the ongoing commitment of the 
Board to supporting diversity and inclusion in the boardroom in all its 
forms including age, gender ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and 
socio-economic background. The Committee acknowledges the 
significant role diversity and inclusion has on the effective functioning 
of the Board and its Committees and believes a diverse board brings 
a broader perspective, which enables it to be better equipped to 
understand the views of our stakeholders as well as our shareholders 
in the decision-making process. 

The Committee reviews the Board Diversity Policy annually to ensure 
the objectives remain appropriate and sufficiently stretching. We also 
continue to monitor requirements as set by the Financial Conduct 
Authority, FTSE Women Leaders Review, NASDAQ listing rules and the 
Parker Review in terms of gender and ethnic diversity. Vodafone 
acknowledges that these targets are not just an end goal, but rather steps 
towards a drive for further progress.

Whilst the Board Diversity Policy specifically focuses on diversity at Board 
and Committee level, commitment to diversity at Vodafone extends 
beyond the Board to the Executive Committee, talent pipeline and global 
workforce. The Board supports management in their efforts to build a 
diverse organisation throughout the Group. As at 31 March 2023, our 
Executive Committee has four positions held by women (33%) and 25% 
of the Executive Committee identifies as ethnically diverse. In the Senior 
Leadership Team, 49 roles are held by women (33%) and 18% of the 
Senior Leadership Team identify as ethnically diverse.

Letter from the Committee Chair
I am pleased to present our report as Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee. This report provides an overview of how the Committee 
operates, an insight into the Committee’s activities during the year 
and its role in ensuring the integrity of the Group’s published financial 
information and the effectiveness of its risk management, controls 
and related processes.

The Committee met five times during the year, which included a joint 
meeting with the ESG Committee. Amparo Moraleda will step-down 
from the Committee with effect from the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. 
The attendance by members at Committee meetings can be seen on 
page 60. Each meeting agenda included a range of topics across the 
Committee’s areas of responsibility.

 – External cyber threats continue to be a Group principal risk and the 

Group invests considerable resources in the technology teams working 
to prevent, identify and manage attempted cyber attacks. During the 
year, the Committee regularly met with the Chief Technology Officer 
and Cyber Security, Technology Assurance and Strategy Director to 
review and challenge the cyber security strategy and also undertook 
a deep dive review of this principal risk.

Read more about cyber security  
on pages 42 to 43

 – We performed deep dive reviews on several other principal risks, including 

technology resilience and future readiness with the Chief Technology Officer 
and Chief Network Officer, as well as threats from emerging technology 
and disruptive business models with the CEO of Vodafone Business and the 
Group Strategy Director. In addition, the Committee undertook a number 
of reviews of M-Pesa with a focus on risk management, the control 
environment, regulatory compliance and assurance activities;

 – We completed a series of reviews across multiple business units, typically 
with a focus on the risk and control environment. This was performed 
with the CEO and CFO of the Other Europe markets cluster, the CEO of 
Vantage Towers, the CEOs of Vodafone Germany, Vodafone Spain and 
Vodacom Group; and

 – At the September 2022 and March 2023 meetings, we considered 
the anticipated financial reporting matters impacting the half-year 
and year-end reporting. We also reviewed the half-year results 
announcement at our November meeting and the Annual Report and 
accompanying materials at our May meeting, prior to the Group’s results 
release. Our work included reviews of goodwill impairment testing, 
taxation judgements, legal contingencies and the Company’s work 
on going concern and the long-term viability statement.

The Committee recognises the importance of Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’) topics and the requirement for disclosures in 
accordance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(‘TCFD’) framework. We modified our terms of reference during the year 
to enhance the Committee’s oversight in these areas by having a joint 
meeting with the ESG Committee. During our joint meeting in May 2023, 
we challenged the disclosures included in this Annual Report and also 
the Group’s ESG Addendum which is available on our website.

Our external auditor, Ernst & Young (‘EY’), provides robust challenge to 
management and its independent view to the Committee on specific 
financial reporting judgements and the control environment.

Objective
The objective of the Committee is the provision of effective governance 
over the appropriateness of financial reporting of the Group, including 
the adequacy of related disclosures, the performance of both the 
Internal Audit function and the external auditor and oversight of the Group’s 
systems of internal control, business risks and related compliance activities.

the Committee minutes. The Committee regularly meets separately with 
the external auditor, the Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial 
Officer, the Group Audit Director and the Group Head of Risk without others 
being present. The Chair also meets regularly with the external lead audit 
partner during the year, outside of the formal Committee process.

The Chair is designated as the financial expert on the Committee 
for the purposes of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’). The Committee continues to 
have competence relevant to the sector in which the Group operates.

Committee approved the disclosures of the accounting policies and 
practices set out in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ and within other notes 
to the consolidated financial statements.

on Form 20-F complies with relevant US regulations;

 – The clarity of the disclosures and compliance with financial 

reporting standards and relevant financial and governance 

reporting requirements; and

 – Any correspondence from regulators in relation to our 

financial reporting.

Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee assessed whether the Annual Report, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy. This 
assessment is supported by the Group’s Disclosure Committee which 
is chaired by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary who 
briefs the Committee on the Disclosure Committee’s work and findings.

The Committee reviewed the processes and controls that underpin 
the Annual Report’s preparation, ensuring that all contributors and 
senior management are fully aware of the requirements and their 
responsibilities. This included the financial reporting responsibilities of 
the Directors under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to promote 
the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as well as 
considering the interests of other stakeholders which will have an impact 
on the Company’s long-term success.

The Committee reviewed an early draft of the Annual Report to 
enable input and comment. The review is performed in conjunction 
with the ESG Committee which also reviews the TCFD and ESG-related 
disclosures. The Committee also reviewed the results announcement, 
supported by the work of the Group’s Disclosure Committee, which 
reviews and assesses the appropriateness of investor communications.

This work enabled the Committee to provide positive assurance to the 
Board to assist it in making the statement required by the Code.

Significant financial reporting judgements
The areas considered and actions taken by the Committee in relation 
to the 2023 consolidated financial statements are outlined below and 
overleaf. For each area, the Committee was satisfied with the accounting 
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. 

Area of focus

Actions taken

Portfolio changes 
The Group concluded several transactions during the second half of the 
financial year of which the most notable was the disposal of a controlling 
stake in Vantage Towers into a joint venture, the disposals of Vodafone 
Hungary and Vodafone Ghana and the transfer of the Group’s 
shareholding in Vodafone Egypt to its subsidiary, Vodacom Group 
Limited. The most significant disclosure and accounting judgements 
considered include:

 – The recognition and measurement of gains on the business disposals, 
including a partial deferral of the gain recognised from the sale of 
Vantage Towers due to the leaseback of tower space by the Group 
from Vantage Towers. See note 12 ‘Investments in associates and 
joint arrangements’ and note 27 ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ in the 
consolidated financial statements.

India accounting matters
The disclosure and accounting judgements in relation to:

 – The Group’s conditional and capped obligations to make certain 
payments to Vodafone Idea Limited (‘VIL’) under a payment 
mechanism agreed at the time of the merger between Vodafone India 
and Idea Cellular in 2017;

 – The valuation of the security package provided by the Group to Indus 
Towers (‘Indus’) in respect of commitments of VIL to Indus and the 
Group’s obligation to the Total Return Swap (‘TRS’) lenders;

 – The valuation of a mark-to-market derivative asset in relation to the TRS;
 – The decision to cease reporting the Group’s investment in Indus as 

held for sale in the consolidated financial statements; and

 – The impairment of the Group’s investment in Indus.

See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ and note 
29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ in the consolidated 
financial statements. 

Impairments
Judgements in relation to impairment testing relate primarily to the 
assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use of the Group’s 
businesses, being the achievability of the long-term business plans and 
the macroeconomic and related valuation model assumptions.

See note 4 ‘Impairment losses’ in the consolidated financial statements. 

The Committee met with the Group Financial Controlling and Operations 
Director in March 2023 to review and challenge the accounting 
treatment and disclosures in the 2023 consolidated financial statements, 
including the sale and leaseback accounting resulting from the disposal 
of Vantage Towers.

The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting 
judgements in relation to potential liabilities under the payment 
mechanism agreed with VIL, considering VIL’s ability to make any further 
material payments.

The Committee also reviewed accounting judgements relating to Indus 
Towers, notably the terms of the remaining pledge contained in the 
security package, the reversal of the held for sale classification in the 
consolidated financial statements and the valuation of the TRS related 
derivative asset. 

These reviews occurred at the September 2022, November 2022, March 
2023 and May 2023 Committee meetings. 

The Committee met with the Group Head of Financial Planning & 
Analysis in November 2022 and May 2023 to discuss the impairment 
exercise undertaken and to challenge the appropriateness of 
assumptions made, including:

 – The consistent application of management’s valuation methodology;
 – The achievability of the Group’s five-year business plans;
 – The potential impacts of (i) rising energy costs, (ii) inflation and (iii) 

climate change on the Group’s businesses and valuation assumptions;
 – The long-term growth assumed for the Group’s businesses at the end 

of the plan period; and

 – The discount rates assumed in the valuation of the Group’s businesses.

During the year, the Group recorded no material impairments of asset 
carrying values.

Area of focus

Actions taken

Liability provisioning
The Group is subject to a range of claims and legal actions from a 
number of sources, including, but not limited to, competitors, regulators, 
customers, suppliers and, on occasion, fellow shareholders in 
Group subsidiaries.

See note 16 ‘Provisions’ and note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal 
proceedings’ in the consolidated financial statements. 

Taxation
The Group is subject to a range of tax claims and related legal actions  
in several jurisdictions where it operates. Furthermore, the Group has 
extensive accumulated tax losses, and a key management judgement  
is whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised in respect 
of those losses.

See note 6 ’Taxation’ and note 29 ’Contingent liabilities and legal 
proceedings’ in the consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue recognition
Revenue is a risk area given the inherent complexity of IFRS 15 
accounting requirements and the underlying billing and related 
IT systems.

See note 1 ’Basis of preparation’ in the consolidated financial statements. 

Hyperinflation accounting in Turkey
Turkey has met the requirements to be designated as a hyperinflationary 
economy under IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary 
Economies’. The Group has therefore applied the requirements of IAS 29 
for its Turkish operations with a Turkish lira functional currency.

See note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ in the consolidated financial statements.

Regulators and our financial reporting
The Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) publishes thematic reviews and 
other guidance to help companies improve the quality of corporate 
reporting through the provision of guidance and reviews of the quality 
of reporting across public companies. The Group routinely reviews FRC 
publications, the most relevant publications for the 2023 Annual 
Report being:

 – Key matters for 2022/23 reports and accounts;
 – Annual review of corporate reporting 2021/22;
 – Thematic review of existing disclosure requirements for (i) discount 

rates, (ii) judgements and estimates, (iii) earnings per share, (iv) deferred 
tax assets, (v) accounting and reporting for business combinations and 
(vi) TCFD and climate-related disclosures;

 – ‘What makes a good Annual Report and Accounts’ guidance;
 – Updated guidance on Strategic Reports; and
 – FRC Lab report on digital security risk disclosure.

The Group already complied with the majority of the recommendations 
and the 2023 Annual Report has been updated to adopt best practice 
where appropriate.

We also reviewed the draft standard for Audit Committees that was 
published by the FRC in the year. The final requirements will be reviewed 
once available although no significant impact is expected as we have 
assessed that the Committee follows the working practices outlined 
in the draft standard.

The Committee met with the Director of Litigation in November 2022 
and May 2023 in advance of the half-year and year-end reporting, 
respectively. The Committee reviewed and challenged management’s 
assessment of the status of the most significant claims, together with 
relevant legal advice received by the Group, to form a view on the level 
of provisioning and appropriateness of disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements. 

The Committee met with the Group Tax Director in November 2022  
and May 2023 in advance of the half-year and year-end financial 
reporting, respectively. The Committee challenged the judgements 
underpinning tax provisioning, deferred tax assets and related 
disclosures. 

The accounting policy for and related disclosure requirements of IFRS 15 
that have been presented in the Annual Report were reviewed in March 
and May 2023.

The Committee considered the scope of EY’s planned revenue audit 
procedures, and their related audit findings and observations at its 
meetings in November 2022 and May 2023. 

The Committee met with the Group Financial Controlling and Operations 
Director in November 2022, March 2023 and May 2023 to review and 
challenge the accounting treatment and disclosures in the half-year and 
year-end financial reporting, respectively. 

During the year, the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) finalised 
new mandatory disclosure requirements on diversity and inclusion. 
The Committee welcomes these new disclosure requirements which 
are included in this Annual Report. 

We continue to track developments for the proposals in the ‘Restoring 
Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance’ paper issued by the Department 
for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (‘BEIS’). This will ensure we are 
well placed to implement the changes, as required, in the years ahead.

During the year, the Group received a notification letter from the FRC that 
the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2022 had been included 
in their thematic review of company disclosures relating to deferred tax 
assets. In October 2022, we received confirmation that the FRC had no 
questions for the Group arising from the review.

In December 2021, Vantage Towers A.G. (‘Vantage Towers’) received 
an enquiry letter from BaFin, the German Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority, containing questions and requests for further information 
in relation to the Vantage Towers Annual Report for the year ended 
31 March 2022. To date, two written responses in January and March 
2023 have been submitted to BaFin as part of the ongoing enquiry.

of reporting across public companies. The Group routinely reviews FRC 

publications, the most relevant publications for the 2023 Annual 

Report being:

 – Key matters for 2022/23 reports and accounts;

 – Annual review of corporate reporting 2021/22;

 – Thematic review of existing disclosure requirements for (i) discount 

rates, (ii) judgements and estimates, (iii) earnings per share, (iv) deferred 

tax assets, (v) accounting and reporting for business combinations and 

(vi) TCFD and climate-related disclosures;

 – ‘What makes a good Annual Report and Accounts’ guidance;

 – Updated guidance on Strategic Reports; and

 – FRC Lab report on digital security risk disclosure.

The Group already complied with the majority of the recommendations 

and the 2023 Annual Report has been updated to adopt best practice 

where appropriate.

We also reviewed the draft standard for Audit Committees that was 

published by the FRC in the year. The final requirements will be reviewed 

once available although no significant impact is expected as we have 

assessed that the Committee follows the working practices outlined 

in the draft standard.

During the year, the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) finalised 

new mandatory disclosure requirements on diversity and inclusion. 

The Committee welcomes these new disclosure requirements which 

are included in this Annual Report. 

We continue to track developments for the proposals in the ‘Restoring 

Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance’ paper issued by the Department 

for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (‘BEIS’). This will ensure we are 

well placed to implement the changes, as required, in the years ahead.

During the year, the Group received a notification letter from the FRC that 

the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2022 had been included 

in their thematic review of company disclosures relating to deferred tax 

assets. In October 2022, we received confirmation that the FRC had no 

questions for the Group arising from the review.

In December 2021, Vantage Towers A.G. (‘Vantage Towers’) received 

an enquiry letter from BaFin, the German Federal Financial Supervisory 

Authority, containing questions and requests for further information 

in relation to the Vantage Towers Annual Report for the year ended 

31 March 2022. To date, two written responses in January and March 

2023 have been submitted to BaFin as part of the ongoing enquiry.

Internal control and risk management
The Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of the 
Group’s system of internal control, including the risk management 
framework, the compliance framework, and the work of the Internal 
Audit function.

Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function provides independent and objective 
assurance over the design and operating effectiveness of the system of 
internal control, through a risk-based approach. The function reports into 
the Committee and, administratively, to the Chief Financial Officer. The 
function is composed of teams across Group functions and local markets. 
This enables access to specialist skills through centres of excellence and 
ensures local knowledge and experience. Cooperation with professional 
bodies and an information technology research firm has ensured access 
to additional specialist skills and an advanced knowledge base.

Internal Audit activities are based on a robust methodology and the 
internal quality assurance improvement programme ensures conformity 
with the International Professional Practices framework, which includes 
the IIA standards and code of ethics, and the continuous development 
of the audit methodology applied. The conformity is reviewed and verified 
through an external quality assessment by an independent consultancy 
firm every three years.

The Committee has a standing agenda item to cover Internal Audit 
related topics. Prior to the start of each financial year, the Committee 
reviews and approves the annual audit plan, assesses the adequacy of 
the budget and resources, and reviews the operational initiatives for the 
continuous improvement of the function’s effectiveness. The audit plan 
is determined by taking into account Internal Audit’s rolling review 
framework and the outputs of a data-driven risk assessment. 

The Committee reviews progress against the approved audit plan and the 
results of Internal Audit activities, with a stronger focus on unsatisfactory 
audit results and cross-entity audits, which are audits that are performed 
across multiple markets with the same scope. Audit results are analysed 
by process and entity to highlight both changes in the control 
environment and areas that require attention.

During the year, Internal Audit coverage focused on principal risks, 
including cyber threat and strategic transformation. Relevant audit results 
are reported before the Committee’s in-depth review with the risk owner, 
which allows the Committee to have an integrated view on the way 
the risk is managed.

Assurance was also provided across a broad range of areas, including: 
product development, customer base management, Vodafone Business 
sales opportunity governance, billing of Internet of Things services, 
compliance with the EU Electronic Communications Code, data 
management, data protection at third parties, asset verification and 
reconciliation, revenue and cost assurance controls, revenue accrual 
processes, lease accounting, active directory infrastructure security, 
Application Programming Interface security and M-Pesa operations. 
The activities performed by the shared service organisation also received 
ongoing focus due to their significance across many processes.

Management is responsible for ensuring that issues raised by Internal 
Audit are addressed within an agreed timetable, and the Committee 
reviews their timely completion.

The last independent review of the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal 
Audit function was performed by Deloitte LLP in January 2022 and the 
results have been presented to the Committee. The review concluded 
that the Internal Audit function operated in accordance with the Global 
Institute of Internal Auditors’ International Professional Practices 
Framework, is at the top of its peer group range and demonstrates areas 
of innovative practice.

The Internal Audit function continues to invest in several initiatives to 
improve its effectiveness, particularly in the adoption of new technologies. 
The innovative use of data analytics has provided broader and deeper 
audit testing and driven increased insights.

Assessment of the Group’s system of internal control, 
including the risk management framework
The Group’s risk assessment process and the way in which significant 
business risks are managed is an area of focus for the Committee. 
The Committee’s activity here was led primarily, but not solely, by the 
Group’s assessment of its principal and emerging risks and uncertainties. 
Cyber threats remain a major focus for the Committee given the 
continual threats in this area.

The Group has an internal control environment designed to protect the 
business from the material risks which have been identified. Management 
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls 
and the Committee has responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness 
of those controls.

The Committee reviewed the process by which Group management 
assessed the control environment, in accordance with the requirements 
of the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting published by the FRC. This activity 
was supported by reports from the Group Audit Director and the Group 
Head of Risk and a range of functional specialists.

As part of the Committee’s recurring agenda items, the Group Security 
Director provided a fraud update, the scope of which would include 
incidents of fraud involving management or employees with a significant 
role in internal controls.

The Group operates a ‘Speak Up’ channel that enables employees to 
anonymously raise concerns about possible irregularities. The Committee 
received an update on the operation of the channel together with the 
output of any resulting investigations.

The Committee has completed its review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control, including risk management, during 
the year and up to the date of this Annual Report. The review covered 
all material controls including financial, operating and compliance 
controls. The Committee confirms that the system of internal control 
operated effectively for the 2023 financial year. Where specific areas 
for improvement were identified, mitigating alternative controls and 
processes were in place. This allows us to provide positive assurance 
to the Board to help fulfil its obligations under the Code.

Compliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Oversight of the Group’s compliance activities in relation to section 404 
of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and policy compliance reviews also fall 
within the Committee’s remit.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal controls over financial reporting and we have responsibility for 
ensuring the effectiveness of these controls. The Committee received 
updates on the Group’s work in relation to section 404 compliance and 
the Group’s broader financial control environment during the year. We 
continue to challenge management on ensuring the nature and scope 
of control activities evolve to ensure key risks continue to be adequately 
mitigated. For example, robust controls over our IT systems are critical 
and were discussed with the Chief Technology Officer and IT Director 
at the November 2022 meeting.

The Committee also took an active role in monitoring the Group’s 
compliance activities, including receiving reports from management in 
the year covering programme-level strategy, the scope of compliance 
work performed and the results of controls testing. The external auditor 
also reports the status of its work in relation to controls in its reports to 
the Committee.

Independence and objectivity
In its assessment of the independence of the auditor, and in accordance 
with the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s (‘PCAOB’) 
standard on independence, the Committee received details of all 
relationships between the Company and EY that may have a bearing 
on its independence and received confirmation from EY that it is 
independent of the Company in accordance with US federal securities 
law and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) and the PCAOB.

Effectiveness of the external audit process
The Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit process 
throughout the year and considered the performance of EY. 
This comprised the Committee’s own assessment and the results of a 
detailed feedback survey of senior personnel across the Group. Based on 
these reviews, the Committee concluded that there had been appropriate 
focus and challenge by EY on the primary areas of the audit and that 
EY had applied robust challenge and scepticism throughout the audit.

EY audit and non-audit fees
Total fees payable to EY for audit and non-audit services in the year 
ended 31 March 2023 amounted to €30 million (FY22: €25 million).

Audit fees
The Committee reviewed and discussed the fee proposal, was engaged 
in agreeing audit scope changes and, following the receipt of formal 
assurance that its fees were appropriate for the scope of the work 
required, agreed an audit fee of €27 million for statutory audit services 
in the year (FY22: €23 million).

Non-audit fees
To protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, 
the Committee has a policy for the engagement of the external auditor 
to provide non-audit services. The policy prohibits EY from playing any 
part in management or decision-making, providing certain services such 
as valuation work and the provision of accounting services. The Group’s 
non-audit services policy incorporates the requirements of the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard, including a ‘whitelist’ of permitted non-audit services 
which mirrors the FRC’s Ethical Standard.

The Committee has pre-approved that EY can be engaged by 
management, subject to the policies set out above, and subject to:

 – A €60,000 fee limit for individual engagements;
 – A €500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no legal 

alternative; and

 – A €500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no practical 

alternative supplier.

For those permitted services that exceed these specified fee limits, 
the Committee Chair pre-approves the service.

Non-audit fees were €3 million (FY22: €2 million). See note 3 ‘Operating 
profit’ in the consolidated financial statements.

Long-term viability statement and  
going concern assessment
The Committee provides advice to the Board on the form and basis of 
conclusion underlying the long-term viability statement and the going 
concern assessment.

Read more about the long-term viability statement  
on page 57

Read more about the going concern assessment  
on page 112

At our meeting in May 2023, the Committee challenged management 
on its financial risk assessment as part of its consideration of the 
long-term viability statement. This included scrutiny of forecast liquidity, 
balance sheet stress tests, the availability of cash and cash equivalents 
through new or existing financing facilities and a review of counter-party 
risk to assess the likelihood of third parties not being able to meet 
contractual obligations. This comprehensive assessment of the Group’s 
prospects made by management included consideration of:

 – The review period and alignment with the Group’s internal 

long-term forecasts;

 – The assessment of the capacity of the Group to remain viable after 

consideration of future cash flows, expected debt service requirements, 
undrawn facilities, and access to capital markets;

 – The modelling of the financial impact of severe but plausible risk 

scenarios materialising, including the impact of energy price inflation;
 – The inclusion of clear and enhanced disclosures in the Annual Report 

as to why the assessment period selected was appropriate to 
the Group, what qualifications and assumptions were made and 
how the underlying analysis was performed, consistent with 
FRC pronouncements; and

 – Comprehensive disclosure in relation to the Group’s liquidity provided 
in the consolidated financial statements. See note 22 ‘Capital and 
financial risk management’ in the consolidated financial statements.

External audit
The Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship 
with the external auditor, EY. This includes making the recommendation 
on the appointment, reappointment, and removal of the external auditor, 
assessing its independence on an ongoing basis, and approving the 
statutory audit fee, the scope of the statutory audit and the appointment 
of the lead audit engagement partner. Alison Duncan has held this role 
for four years since the appointment of EY as external auditor for the year 
ended 31 March 2020.

EY presented to the Committee its detailed audit plan for the 2023 
financial year, which outlined its audit scope, planning materiality and its 
assessment of key audit risks. The identification of key audit risks is critical 
in the overall effectiveness of the external audit process and these are 
outlined in the Auditor’s report.

The Committee also received reports from EY on its assessment 
of the accounting and disclosures in the financial statements and 
financial controls.

The Committee will continue to review the auditor appointment and 
anticipates that the audit will be put out to tender at least every 10 years. 
The Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 
for the financial year under review. The last external audit tender took 
place in 2019 which resulted in the appointment of EY.

ESG Committee
The role of the ESG Committee is to provide 
oversight of Vodafone’s Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’) programme, of sustainability and 
responsible business practices, as well as Vodafone’s 
contribution to the societies that we operate in 
under the social contract.

and responsible business practices, as well as the contribution to the 
societies they operate in under their the social contract;

Letter from Committee Chair
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Vodafone’s ESG 
Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2023.

The Committee was established in 2021 with the founding members 
selected to ensure a range of experience across the range of topics that 
fall within ESG. In November 2022, we welcomed our fourth Committee 
member, Simon Segars. Simon brings significant experience and insights 
to the ESG Committee, including how technology and connectivity are 
reshaping our digital societies. 

On 10 May 2023, it was announced that Valerie Gooding and Dame Clara 
Furse would be retiring following the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. 
I would like to thank them both for their contribution since this Committee 
was established two years ago. Jean-François van Boxmeer and Christine 
Ramon will be joining this Committee on the same date and their insights 
will be an excellent addition to the Committee. 

This year, the Committee met twice, in November 2022 and March 2023. 
Each meeting agenda included a range of topics across the Committee’s 
areas of responsibility. During FY23, the Committee undertook deep dives 
on each of Vodafone’s three purpose pillars, as well as Vodafone’s 
approach to responsible business. These deep dives were supplemented 
by committee training on key Planet-related topics by the Group 
Sustainability team, and other experts across the business.

Now that the Committee has explored each of the key purpose themes 
in detail, we will move into receiving regular updates on progress against 
our key ESG strategy.

In addition to these thematic deep dives, a key focus of the ESG 
Committee this year was oversight of Vodafone’s ESG data transformation 
and disclosure programme. High quality and timely data is a core 

component of a successful ESG strategy, both to ensure that we can 
track progress against targets, and to enable decision-making by 
investors, consumers, suppliers, governments and other stakeholders. 

Recognising this, the Board was pleased to see that management updated 
their approach to ESG reporting this year, by giving joint responsibility 
for ESG reporting to the Group Financial Reporting team and the Group 
Sustainable Business team. This allowed the teams to apply financial 
reporting principles to non-financial ESG data, including establishing a 
control framework and securing external assurance on key data points. 

These changes have already yielded positive changes and set a firm basis 
from which to grow. However we acknowledge that there is a long road 
ahead before ESG disclosures will match similar levels of data quality to 
financial disclosures, not only for Vodafone, but for other corporates too. 
The absence of a clear framework for the calculation and reporting of 
ESG data exacerbates the challenge for all reporters. For example, we 
expect these challenges will come into sharper focus as Scope 3 emission 
reductions become a priority for corporates. 

In November 2022 the Committee reviewed its terms of reference and 
agreed to introduce new joint oversight of selected ESG matters between 
the ESG Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee. This will be 
executed through increased sharing of papers between the committees, 
and a new joint meeting each May to review ESG disclosures.

On behalf of the Committee, I have reported this year’s work to the Board 
and I am looking forward to the next year chairing the Committee, starting 
with the joint ESG Committee and Audit and Risk Committee meeting 
in May 2023.

The Committee will continue oversight and scrutiny of Vodafone’s ESG 
agenda, including further presentations from senior management and 
experts across the Group. We will review against Vodafone’s strategy  
and the pathways in place to achieve Vodafone’s targets across its three 
purpose pillars. Consideration of the following stakeholder interests will 
remain part of the Committee’s responsibility. We set out below some 
of our key stakeholders and examples of their ESG-related interests:

 – Investors: Board-level oversight of Vodafone’s ESG strategy and 

performance is a key part of an effective ESG programme;

 – Governments and regulators: Local and international legal and 

regulatory obligations on ESG topics to increase;

 – Local communities and NGOs: ESG topics affect the day-to-day lives 

of the people in the communities that we serve;

 – Suppliers and customers: Upholding high ethical standards 

throughout our value chain is critical for stakeholders when deciding 
whether they should do business with Vodafone; and

 – Employees: Employees take pride in working for a purpose-driven 

organisation that is enabling an inclusive and sustainable digital society.

We believe the ESG Committee will continue to add value to the 
long-term success of Vodafone, for the benefit of our customers, key 
stakeholders, and the societies in which we operate. I will be available to 
engage with shareholders who have questions or comments about the 
work of the Committee at our 2023 AGM.

Remuneration Committee

Letter from the Remuneration  
Committee Chair
On behalf of the Board, I present our 2023  
Directors’ Remuneration Report.

This report includes both our proposed Policy Report (which will be 
submitted for shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM), and our 2023 
Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out how our current policy 
was implemented during the year under review, and how, subject to its 
approval, our revised policy will be applied for the year ahead.

Remuneration Policy review
Our current Policy Report was approved at the July 2020 AGM, with a 
vote in favour of over 96%. Following the policy entering its third year of 
operation without amendment, the Committee has been reviewing our 
remuneration structures ahead of the regulatory requirement for a new 
policy to be submitted to shareholders at the 2023 AGM.

The Committee is clear that consistency and flexibility should be 
maintained within the new policy and in the event material revisions are 
required before the end of its three-year regulatory lifecycle then the 
Committee will re-engage with shareholders.

Following its review of the current arrangements, which the Committee is 
satisfied remain appropriate and operating as intended, and having made 
a significant number of best practice changes when the policy was last 
renewed, the Committee is not proposing to make any material changes 
at this time.

Instead, some refinements to our framework and the implementation 
of our structures are proposed. These include the review of our 
short-term incentive to more fully support our priorities of Growth and 
Customers (further details of which are provided later in this letter under 
‘Arrangements for 2024’). The Committee is also strengthening our 
clawback policy with the current list of trigger events expanded to 
include a breach of an executive’s restrictive or confidentiality covenants, 
reflecting the importance in our industry of retaining and protecting key 
talent and intellectual property. Clawback time frames are also being 
revised to ensure compliance with the recently announced SEC 
requirements, the vast majority of which our current arrangements 
already complied with.

The implementation of our long-term incentive plan is subject to the 
Global Incentive Plan Rules which were last approved by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM. In line with UK regulations, the Rules need to be approved 
by shareholders at least every 10 years and will be submitted for approval 
at the 2023 AGM. The Committee, with its external legal advisers, has 
reviewed the Rules to ensure they reflect latest market practice.

Engagement during the year
Shareholder feedback has always played a vital role in the development 
of our executive remuneration policy and this is reflected in this year’s 
shareholder consultation. As part of this engagement the Committee 
contacted shareholders with a combined holding of c.50% in Vodafone 
Group Plc. We also actively engaged with a variety of investor bodies and 
proxy agencies before finalising the Policy Report which will be submitted 
for approval at the 2023 AGM. I would like to thank all stakeholders that 
engaged in this year’s review.

In terms of engaging the employee voice, as Workforce Engagement 
Lead, I attended meetings with both our European and African forums, 
with feedback and comments from the meetings subsequently 
presented back directly to the Board. The key topics raised by employee 
representatives this year focused on the cost of living support being 
provided, progress against our Race, Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage 
targets, internal talent development, and our wider business performance. 
I would like to thank the representatives from both forums for inviting 
me and for contributing to the discussions.

and Chair of the Remuneration Committee explain her 
role: investors.vodafone.com/videos

When looking at the feedback from these forums and our other 
channels of engagement it is evident that our colleagues value the 
open and regular updates the business has given throughout the year, 
and the Board will ensure these continue in the year ahead.

on pages 10 to 12 of this Annual Report

Fair pay 
It is recognised that rising inflation levels and the subsequent cost of 
living crisis have impacted colleagues across a number of our markets 
this year. To help alleviate the impact of these pressures, targeted support 
was provided in locations including the UK, Turkey and Egypt. Such 
measures included additional or accelerated salary reviews, the provision 
of extra cash allowances, and the careful consideration of wider market 
conditions when setting salary budgets for the 2023 review.

When making decisions on executive remuneration the Committee 
considers pay in the wider context including arrangements elsewhere 
in the business, our fair pay principles and stakeholder considerations.

Arrangements for 2024
Base salary and pension arrangements
Following her appointment to the position of Group Chief Executive, 
Margherita Della Valle’s salary was set at £1,250,000. The Committee 
decided the new salary was appropriate when compared against the 
external market, was fair from a gender pay perspective given its long 
standing work on fair pay, as referenced above, and reflected both the 
responsibilities and demands of the role.

During the year no additional salary payment or allowance has been 
made to Margherita Della Valle in respect of her carrying out the dual 
roles of Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer. This will 
remain the approach going forward, and it is intended that Margherita will 
continue with her dual responsibilities until the search for a new Group 
Chief Financial Officer is complete.

Pension arrangements for Executive Directors will continue to remain 
aligned with the wider UK workforce at 10% of base salary.

Annual bonus (‘GSTIP’)
In recent years the performance measures have normally been equally 
weighted across service revenue, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted EBIT, 
and customer appreciation. The Committee adjusted these weightings 
ahead of the start of the FY24 plan to ensure performance against the 
strategic priorities of Growth and Customers is fully incentivised.

For the 2024 plan, measures under the annual bonus will be:

 – Growth (70%): service revenue (20%), adjusted EBIT (20%), adjusted 

free cash flow (20%) and revenue market share (10%).

 – Customers (30%): Net Promoter Score (20%), and churn (10%).

Global long-term incentive (‘GLTI’)
Following a comprehensive review of the GLTI structure the Committee 
determined that this will remain unchanged for 2024. The measures 
under the long-term incentive will continue to be weighted at 60% 
adjusted free cash flow, 30% relative TSR and 10% ESG.

Remuneration Committee (continued)

Performance outcomes during 2023
GSTIP performance (1 April 2022 – 31 March 2023)
Annual bonus performance during the year was measured against 
both financial and strategic measures. The four measures were equally 
weighted at 25% each, with financial metrics constituting service revenue, 
adjusted EBIT and adjusted free cash flow whilst the strategic measure 
was linked to customer appreciation KPIs. These KPIs covered metrics 
including churn, revenue market share, and Net Promoter Score.

Performance under the service revenue, free cash flow and customer 
appreciation measures was above the mid-point of the target range whilst 
performance against EBIT was below the mid-point. The combined 
performance resulted in an overall bonus payout of 55.8% of maximum.

Read more  
on pages 94 and 95

GLTI performance (1 April 2020 – 31 March 2023)
The 2021 GLTI award (granted November 2020) was subject to adjusted 
free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award), 
and ESG (10% of total award) performance. All performance conditions 
were measured over the three-year period ending 31 March 2023.

Final adjusted FCF performance finished above the mid-point of the range 
resulting in 72.7% of the adjusted FCF element vesting. Relative TSR 
performance was below the median of the peer group resulting in no 
vesting under this measure. ESG performance was assessed against three 
metrics and vested at 95.3%. This resulted in an overall vesting percentage 
for the 2021 GLTI of 53.2% of maximum.

Consideration of discretion
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the outcomes of 
both the annual bonus and long-term incentive plan in light of both 
the relevant performance targets and wider internal and external 
considerations across the respective measurement periods. Outcomes 
were reviewed against the wider employee experience during the 
periods under review with the Committee noting the steps taken in 
markets to help employees with the cost of living. The Committee also 
acknowledged that no windfall gains had occurred under the long-term 
incentive plan. It was agreed that the outcomes were appropriate and that 
no adjustments were required.

Looking forward
Following the conclusion of the 2023 AGM I will be stepping down as Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee. Amparo Moraleda will be appointed 
as Chair of the Committee and Dame Clara Furse will be stepping down 
as a member of the Committee with effect from the same date. 

The rest of this report sets out both our proposed Policy Report, as will 
be submitted at the 2023 AGM, and our Annual Report on Remuneration, 
which sets out the decisions and outcomes summarised in this letter 
in further detail.

Remuneration Policy
In this forward-looking section we describe our Remuneration Policy for the Board. This includes our considerations when determining policy, 
a description of the elements of the reward package, including an indication of the potential future value of this package for the Executive Directors, 
and the policy applied to the Chair and Non-Executive Directors.

We will be seeking shareholder approval for our Remuneration Policy at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) and we intend to implement it at that 
point. A summary and explanation of the proposed changes to the current Remuneration Policy is provided on page 85. The proposed Remuneration 
Policy submitted for shareholders’ approval at the 2023 AGM does not differ substantively from the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 
2020 except for changes made to align the terms of the Remuneration Policy with the drafting of the rules of the new Global Incentive Plan 2023, which 
is also being submitted for shareholders’ approval at the 2023 AGM. Subject to approval, we will review our Remuneration Policy each year to ensure that 
it continues to support our Company strategy and, if it is necessary to make a change to our Remuneration Policy within the next three years, we will seek 
prior shareholder approval for the change.

Considerations when determining our Remuneration Policy
To avoid conflicts of interest, the Remuneration Committee is entirely comprised of Non-Executive Directors (who are not eligible to participate in the 
Company’s annual bonus or long-term incentive arrangements) and the Remuneration Committee ensures that individuals are not present when the 
Remuneration Committee discusses their own remuneration. A critical consideration for the Remuneration Committee when determining our 
Remuneration Policy is to ensure that it supports our Company purpose, strategy, and business objectives.

A variety of stakeholder views are taken into account when determining executive pay, including those of our shareholders, colleagues, and external 
bodies. Further details of how we engage with, and consider the views of, each of these stakeholders are set out on page 100.

In advance of submitting our Remuneration Policy for shareholder approval we ran a thorough consultation exercise with our major shareholders. 
We invited our top 25 shareholders (constituting a combined holding of c.50% of our issued share capital at the time of engagement) and a number of 
key governance stakeholders to comment on remuneration at Vodafone and to provide feedback on the proposed changes to the current Remuneration 
Policy which was approved at the 2020 AGM. A number of meetings between shareholders and the Remuneration Committee Chair took place during 
this consultation period. 

Listening to and consulting with our employees is very important and the Remuneration Committee is supportive of the activities undertaken to engage 
the employee voice. Our engagement with employees can take different forms in different markets but includes a variety of channels and approaches 
including our annual people survey which attracts very high levels of participation and engagement, regular business leader Q&A sessions, and a number 
of internal digital communication platforms.

Our Workforce Engagement Lead also undertakes an annual attendance at our European employee forum, and a similar body which covers our African 
markets, with any questions or concerns raised by the employee representatives presented directly to the Board for consideration and discussion. 
Any actions taken by the Board are then fed back to these forums to ensure a two-way dialogue.

Whilst we do not formally consult directly with employees on the Remuneration Policy nor is any fixed remuneration comparison measurement used 
when determining the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee is briefed on pay and employment conditions of 
employees in the Vodafone Group, with particular reference to the market in which the executive is based. The Company operates Sharesave, a UK 
all-employee share plan, as well as other discretionary share-based incentive arrangements, which means that the wider workforce have the opportunity 
to become shareholders in the Company and be able to vote on the Remuneration Policy in the same way as other shareholders. Further information 
on our approach to remuneration for other employees is given on page 90.

Performance measures and targets
Our Company strategy and business objectives are the primary consideration when we are selecting performance measures for our incentive plans. 
The targets within our incentive plans that are related to internal financial measures (such as revenue, profit and cash flow) are typically determined based 
on our budgets. Targets for strategic and external measures (such as customer-focused metrics, ESG measures, and total shareholder return (‘TSR’)) are 
set based on Company objectives and in light of the competitive marketplace. The threshold and maximum levels of performance are set to reflect 
minimum acceptable levels at threshold and very stretching levels at maximum.

As in previous Remuneration Reports, we will disclose the details of our performance metrics for our short- and long-term incentive plans. However, 
our annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and therefore we will only disclose our targets in the Remuneration Report following the completion 
of the financial year. We will normally disclose the targets for each long-term award in the Remuneration Report for the financial year preceding the start 
of the performance period.

At the end of each performance period we review performance against the targets, using judgement to account for items such as (but not limited to) 
mergers, acquisitions, disposals, foreign exchange rate movements, changes in accounting treatment, material one-off tax settlements etc. 
The application of judgement is important to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.

Remuneration Policy (continued)

Malus and clawback
The Remuneration Committee reviews the incentive plan results before any payments are made to executives or any shares vest and has full discretion 
to adjust the final payment or vesting if they believe circumstances warrant it. In particular, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to use either 
malus or clawback as it sees appropriate. In the case of malus, the award may lapse wholly or in part, may vest to a lesser extent than it would otherwise 
have vested or vesting may be delayed.

In the case of clawback, the Remuneration Committee may recover bonus amounts that have been paid up to three years after the relevant payment 
date, or recover share awards that have vested up to five years after the relevant grant date. In line with best practice guidance, the key trigger events 
for the use of the clawback arrangements include material misstatement of results, material miscalculation of performance condition outcomes, the 
Executive Director’s gross misconduct, or breach of their restrictive covenants, the Executive Director causing a material financial loss to the Group as 
a result of reckless or negligent conduct or inappropriate values or behaviour, corporate failure or serious reputational damage.

Subject to approval of this Remuneration Policy, these arrangements will be applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, following the 
2023 AGM. The current clawback arrangements, which are set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM, have been 
applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, since the 2020 AGM.

The Remuneration Policy table

The table below summarises the main components of the reward package for Executive Directors.

Fixed pay: Base salary

Purpose and link 
to strategy

To attract and retain the best talent

Operation

Salaries are usually reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months commencing 1 July. Decisions are influenced by:

 – the level of skill, experience and scope of responsibilities;
 – business performance, scarcity of talent, economic climate and market conditions;
 – increases elsewhere within the Group; and
 – external comparator groups (which are used for reference purposes only) made up of companies of similar size 

and complexity to Vodafone.

Opportunity

Average salary increases for existing Executive Committee members (including Executive Directors) will not normally exceed 
average increases for employees in other appropriate parts of the Group. Increases above this level may be made in specific 
situations. These situations could include (but are not limited to) internal promotions, changes to role, material changes to the 
business and exceptional Company performance.

Performance metrics

None.

Fixed pay: Pension

Purpose and link 
to strategy

To remain competitive within the marketplace

Operation

 – Executive Directors may choose to participate in the defined contribution pension scheme or to receive a cash allowance 

in lieu of pension.

Opportunity

 – The pension contribution or cash payment is equal to the maximum employer contribution available to our UK employees 

under our Defined Contribution scheme (currently 10% of annual gross salary).

Performance metrics

None.

Fixed pay: Benefits

Purpose and link  
to strategy

To aid retention and remain competitive within the marketplace

Operation

 – Travel-related benefits. These may include (but are not limited to) a company car or cash allowance, fuel and access to 

a driver where appropriate.

 – Private medical, death and disability insurance and annual health checks for the Executive Directors and their families.
 – In the event that we ask an individual to relocate we would offer them support in line with Vodafone’s relocation and 
international assignment policies. This may cover (but is not limited to) relocation, cost of living allowance, housing, 
home leave, education support, and tax equalisation and advice.

 – Legal and tax support fees if appropriate.
 – Other benefits are also offered in line with the benefits offered to other employees, for example, our all-employee share 

plan, mobile phone discounts, maternity/paternity benefits, sick leave, paid holiday etc.

Opportunity

 – Benefits will be provided in line with appropriate levels indicated by local market practice in the country of employment, 

though no monetary maximum has been set.

 – We expect to maintain benefits at the current level but the value of any benefit may fluctuate depending on, amongst other 

things, personal situation, insurance premiums and other external factors.

Performance metrics

None.

Subject to approval of this Remuneration Policy, these arrangements will be applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, following the 

2023 AGM. The current clawback arrangements, which are set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM, have been 

applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, since the 2020 AGM.

The Remuneration Policy table

The table below summarises the main components of the reward package for Executive Directors.

Purpose and link 

To attract and retain the best talent

Fixed pay: Base salary

to strategy

Operation

Salaries are usually reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months commencing 1 July. Decisions are influenced by:

 – the level of skill, experience and scope of responsibilities;

 – business performance, scarcity of talent, economic climate and market conditions;

 – increases elsewhere within the Group; and

 – external comparator groups (which are used for reference purposes only) made up of companies of similar size 

and complexity to Vodafone.

Opportunity

Average salary increases for existing Executive Committee members (including Executive Directors) will not normally exceed 

average increases for employees in other appropriate parts of the Group. Increases above this level may be made in specific 

situations. These situations could include (but are not limited to) internal promotions, changes to role, material changes to the 

business and exceptional Company performance.

Performance metrics

None.

Fixed pay: Pension

Purpose and link 

To remain competitive within the marketplace

 – Executive Directors may choose to participate in the defined contribution pension scheme or to receive a cash allowance 

in lieu of pension.

Opportunity

 – The pension contribution or cash payment is equal to the maximum employer contribution available to our UK employees 

under our Defined Contribution scheme (currently 10% of annual gross salary).

Purpose and link  

To aid retention and remain competitive within the marketplace

 – Travel-related benefits. These may include (but are not limited to) a company car or cash allowance, fuel and access to 

a driver where appropriate.

 – Private medical, death and disability insurance and annual health checks for the Executive Directors and their families.

 – In the event that we ask an individual to relocate we would offer them support in line with Vodafone’s relocation and 

international assignment policies. This may cover (but is not limited to) relocation, cost of living allowance, housing, 

home leave, education support, and tax equalisation and advice.

 – Legal and tax support fees if appropriate.

 – Other benefits are also offered in line with the benefits offered to other employees, for example, our all-employee share 

plan, mobile phone discounts, maternity/paternity benefits, sick leave, paid holiday etc.

Opportunity

 – Benefits will be provided in line with appropriate levels indicated by local market practice in the country of employment, 

though no monetary maximum has been set.

 – We expect to maintain benefits at the current level but the value of any benefit may fluctuate depending on, amongst other 

things, personal situation, insurance premiums and other external factors.

Fixed pay: Benefits

Annual bonus – Global Short-Term Incentive Plan (‘GSTIP’)

Purpose and link 
to strategy

To drive behaviour and communicate the key priorities for the year.

To motivate employees and incentivise delivery of performance over the one-year operating cycle.

The financial metrics drive our growth strategies whilst also focusing on improving operating efficiencies.

The strategic measures aim to ensure a great customer experience remains at the heart of what we do. 

Operation

 – Bonus levels and the appropriateness of measures and weightings are reviewed annually to ensure they continue 

to support our strategy.

 – Performance over the financial year is measured against stretching financial and non-financial performance targets set 

at the start of the financial year.

 – The annual bonus is usually paid in cash in June each year for performance over the previous year. A mandatory deferral 
of 25% of post-tax bonus earned into shares for two years will normally apply except where an Executive Director has met 
or exceeded their share ownership requirement. The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the size of 
the bonus based on the achievement of the relevant performance conditions to reflect the Company’s and the Executive 
Director’s underlying performance and any other factors the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate.

Opportunity

 – Bonuses can range from 0 to 200% of base salary, with 100% paid for on-target performance.

Performance metrics

 – Performance over each financial year is measured against stretching targets set at the beginning of the year.
 – The performance measures normally comprise a mix of financial and strategic measures. Financial measures may include 
(but are not limited to) profit, revenue and cash flow with a weighting of no less than 50%. Strategic measures may include 
(but are not limited to) customer appreciation KPIs such as churn, revenue market share, and NPS.

Long-term incentive – Global Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘GLTI’)

Purpose and link  
to strategy

To motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained performance over the long term.

To support and encourage greater shareholder alignment through a high level of personal share ownership.

The use of free cash flow as the principal performance measure ensures we apply prudent cash management and 
rigorous capital discipline to our investment decisions.

The use of TSR along with a performance period of not less than three years means that we are focused on the 
long-term interests of our shareholders.

The use of ESG metrics reflects the importance of our performance and progress against our long-term ambitions 
in this area.

Operation

 – Award levels and the framework for determining vesting are reviewed annually.
 – Long-term incentive awards consist of awards of shares subject to performance conditions which are granted in respect 

of any financial year.

 – Awards will vest based on Group performance against the performance metrics set out below, measured over a period of 

normally not less than three years. In exceptional circumstances, such as but not limited to where a delay to the grant date 
is required, the Remuneration Committee may set a vesting period of less than three years, although awards will continue 
to be subject to a performance period of at least three years.

 – Awards may be subject to a mandatory two-year post-vesting holding period before the underlying shares can be sold.
 – Dividend equivalents are paid in cash and/or shares by reference to the vesting period (and holding period, if applicable) in 

respect of shares that vest. 

Opportunity

 – Maximum long-term incentive face value at award of 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% for other 

Performance metrics

Executive Directors in respect of any financial year.

 – Threshold long-term incentive face value at award is 20% of maximum opportunity. Minimum vesting is 0% of maximum 

opportunity. Awards vest on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum.

 – The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the extent to which an award vests based on the 

achievement of the relevant performance conditions and to reflect the Company’s and Executive Director’s underlying 
performance and any other factors the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate. In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee has the discretion to reduce long-term incentive grant levels for Executive Directors who have neither met their 
shareholding guideline nor increased their shareholding by 100% of salary during the year.

 – Performance is measured against stretching targets set at the time of grant.
 – Vesting is determined based on the following measures: adjusted free cash flow as our operational performance measure, 

relative TSR against a peer group of companies as our external performance measure, and ESG as a measure of our external 
impact and commitment to our purpose.

 – Weightings will be determined each year and will normally constitute 60% on adjusted free cash flow, 30% on relative total 
shareholder return, and 10% on ESG. The Remuneration Committee will determine the actual weighting of an award prior 
to grant, taking into account all relevant information.

Remuneration Policy (continued)

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table
Existing arrangements
We will honour existing awards, incentives, benefits and contractual arrangements made to individuals prior to their promotion to the Board and/or prior 
to the approval and implementation of this Remuneration Policy. For the avoidance of doubt this includes payments in respect of any award granted under 
any previous Remuneration Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest (or lapse) or the benefits or contractual arrangements no longer apply.

Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’)
When referring to our long-term incentive awards we use the financial year end in which the award was made. For example, the “2023 award” was made 
in the financial year ending 31 March 2023. The awards are usually made in the first half of the financial year.

The extent to which awards vest depends on three performance conditions:

 – underlying operational performance as measured by adjusted free cash flow;
 – relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) against a peer group median; and
 – performance against our Environmental, Social, and Governance (‘ESG’) targets.

Further details of these performance conditions are set out below. The Remuneration Committee reserves the right during the lifetime of the 
Remuneration Policy to change the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards to other financial, shareholder return and strategic metrics, if the 
Remuneration Committee determines that to do so would be in the best interests of the Company. However, in such circumstances, the majority of the 
GLTI awards would continue to remain subject to financial performance targets. The Remuneration Committee would engage with major shareholders 
prior to changing the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards in this way.

Adjusted free cash flow
The free cash flow performance is based on the cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure over the performance period. The detailed targets and 
the definition of adjusted free cash flow are determined each year as appropriate. The target adjusted free cash flow level is set by reference to our 
long-range plan and market expectations. The Remuneration Committee sets these targets to be sufficiently demanding and with significant stretch.

The cumulative adjusted free cash flow vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below 
(with linear interpolation between points):

Performance

Below threshold
Threshold
Maximum

Vesting percentage 
(% of FCF element) 

0%
20%
100%

Relative TSR
We have a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile. As such, the outperformance of the 
median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure. The peer group and outperformance range for the performance condition are 
reviewed each year and amended as appropriate.

The TSR vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear interpolation between 
points):

Performance

Below threshold

Maximum (outperformance of median as determined per award)

Vesting percentage 
(% of TSR element)

0%

100%

In order to determine the percentages for the equivalent outperformance levels above median, the Remuneration Committee seeks independent 
external advice.

ESG performance
Our ESG targets are set on an annual basis (in accordance with our approach for our other performance measures) and are aligned to our externally 
communicated ambitions in this area. Where performance is below the agreed ambition, the Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to assess 
vesting based on performance against the stated ambition and any other relevant information.

Remuneration policy for other employees
While our remuneration policy follows the same fundamental principles across the Group, packages offered to employees reflect differences in 
market practice in the different countries, role and seniority.

For example, the remuneration package elements for our Executive Committee are essentially the same as for the Executive Directors with some minor 
differences, for example smaller levels of share awards and local variances where appropriate. The remuneration for the next level of management, our 
Senior Leadership Team, again follows the same principles with local and/or individual performance aspects in the annual bonus targets and GLTI awards. 
They also receive lower levels of share awards which are partly delivered in conditional share awards without performance conditions.

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table

Existing arrangements

We will honour existing awards, incentives, benefits and contractual arrangements made to individuals prior to their promotion to the Board and/or prior 

to the approval and implementation of this Remuneration Policy. For the avoidance of doubt this includes payments in respect of any award granted under 

any previous Remuneration Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest (or lapse) or the benefits or contractual arrangements no longer apply.

Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’)

When referring to our long-term incentive awards we use the financial year end in which the award was made. For example, the “2023 award” was made 

in the financial year ending 31 March 2023. The awards are usually made in the first half of the financial year.

The extent to which awards vest depends on three performance conditions:

 – underlying operational performance as measured by adjusted free cash flow;

 – relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) against a peer group median; and

 – performance against our Environmental, Social, and Governance (‘ESG’) targets.

Further details of these performance conditions are set out below. The Remuneration Committee reserves the right during the lifetime of the 

Remuneration Policy to change the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards to other financial, shareholder return and strategic metrics, if the 

Remuneration Committee determines that to do so would be in the best interests of the Company. However, in such circumstances, the majority of the 

GLTI awards would continue to remain subject to financial performance targets. The Remuneration Committee would engage with major shareholders 

prior to changing the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards in this way.

Adjusted free cash flow

The free cash flow performance is based on the cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure over the performance period. The detailed targets and 

the definition of adjusted free cash flow are determined each year as appropriate. The target adjusted free cash flow level is set by reference to our 

long-range plan and market expectations. The Remuneration Committee sets these targets to be sufficiently demanding and with significant stretch.

For example, the remuneration package elements for our Executive Committee are essentially the same as for the Executive Directors with some minor 

differences, for example smaller levels of share awards and local variances where appropriate. The remuneration for the next level of management, our 

Senior Leadership Team, again follows the same principles with local and/or individual performance aspects in the annual bonus targets and GLTI awards. 

They also receive lower levels of share awards which are partly delivered in conditional share awards without performance conditions.

Estimates of total future potential remuneration from 2024 pay packages
The tables below provide estimates of the potential future remuneration for Executive Directors based on the remuneration opportunity to be granted in 
the 2024 financial year. Potential outcomes based on different performance scenarios are provided in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements.

The assumptions underlying each scenario are described below.

Fixed

Consists of base salary, benefits and pension.

Base salary is at 1 July 2023.

Benefits are valued using the figures in the total remuneration for the 2023 financial year table on page 94 (of the 2023 annual report).

Pensions are valued by applying cash allowance rate of 10% of base salary at 1 July 2023.

Mid-point

Based on what a Director would receive if performance was in line with the Company’s business plan.

The opportunity for the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) is 100% of base salary under this scenario.

The opportunity for the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) reflects assumed achievement mid-way between threshold and 
maximum performance.

Maximum

The maximum award opportunity for the GSTIP is 200% of base salary.

Maximum 
+50%

All scenarios

The maximum GLTI opportunity reflects full vesting based on the maximum award levels set out in this Remuneration Policy  
(i.e. 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer). 

The same assumptions apply as for ‘Maximum’ but with a 50% uplift in the value of the GLTI award.

Long-term incentives consist of share awards only which are measured at face value, i.e. no assumption is made for dividend 
equivalents which may be payable.

Recruitment remuneration
Our approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary and appropriate to attract the right talent to the role.

The Remuneration Policy table (pages 88 and 89) sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package 
for the appointment of an Executive Director. Any new Director’s remuneration package will take into account the elements and constraints of those of 
the existing Directors performing similar roles and the individual circumstances of the new Director. This means a potential maximum bonus opportunity 
of 200% of base salary and long-term incentive maximum face value of opportunity at award of 500% of base salary.

When considering the remuneration arrangements of individuals recruited from external roles to the Board, we will take into account the remuneration 
package of that individual in their prior role. We only provide additional compensation to individuals for awards forgone. If necessary we will seek to 
replicate, as far as practicable, the level and timing of such remuneration, taking into account also any remaining performance requirements applying to it. 
This will be achieved by granting awards of cash or shares that vest over a timeframe similar to those forfeited and, if appropriate, based on performance 
conditions. A commensurate reduction in quantum will be applied where it is determined that the new awards are either not subject to performance 
conditions or subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those of the awards forfeited. Where it is not practicable to grant these 
‘buy-out’ awards using the GLTI rules submitted to shareholders at the 2023 AGM, the Company may grant these awards using bespoke arrangements.

Service contracts of Executive Directors
Executive Directors’ contracts have rolling terms and can be terminated with no more than 12 months’ notice.

The key elements of the service contract for Executive Directors relate to remuneration, payments on loss of office (see next page), and restrictions during 
active employment (and for 12 months thereafter). These restrictions include non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and employees.

Remuneration Policy (continued)

Treatment of corporate events
All of the Company’s share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control of the Company. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest 
and become exercisable on a change of control taking into account, in respect of GLTI awards, the extent to which, in the Remuneration Committee’s 
opinion, any relevant performance conditions are satisfied, the Company’s and the Executive Director’s performance, any other relevant factors and, 
unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed.

In the event of a demerger, distribution (other than an ordinary dividend) or other transaction which would affect the current or future value of any award, 
the Remuneration Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a change of control described above. Alternatively, an adjustment may 
be made to the number of shares if considered appropriate.

Payments for departing Executive Directors
In the table below we summarise the key elements of our Remuneration Policy on payments for loss of office. We will always comply both with the relevant plan 
rules and local employment legislation. The Remuneration Committee may make any statutory payment that is required in any relevant jurisdiction.

 – 12 months’ notice from the Company to the Executive Director.
 – Up to 12 months’ base salary and contractual benefits (in line with the notice period). Notice period payments will either be made 
as normal (if the Executive Director continues to work during the notice period or is on gardening leave) or they will be made as 
monthly payments in lieu of notice (subject to mitigation if alternative employment is obtained).

 – The annual bonus may be pro-rated for the period of service during the financial year and will reflect the extent to which Company 

performance has been achieved. The annual bonus may be paid in such proportions of cash and shares, and subject to such 
deferral arrangements, as the Remuneration Committee may determine.

 – The Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust the entitlement to an annual bonus to reflect the individual’s performance 

and the circumstances of the termination.

 – Normally, unvested GLTI awards will lapse when an Executive Director leaves the Group. However, an Executive Director’s award will 

vest in accordance with the terms of the plan to the extent determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account 
applicable performance conditions, the underlying performance of the Company and of the Executive Director and any other relevant 
factors, if the Executive Director dies in service or leaves because of their ill health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or the 
sale of their employing company or business out of the Group or for any other reason determined by the Remuneration Committee, 
more than five months after the month in which the award is granted. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine 
whether the award will vest at the normal vesting date or earlier. The Remuneration Committee will determine the satisfaction of 
performance conditions applicable to the award. Awards will, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, be pro-rated 
for the proportion of the vesting period that had elapsed at the date the Executive Director leaves the Group.

 – The Remuneration Committee has discretion to vary the level of vesting as deemed appropriate, and in particular to determine that 

awards should not vest for reasons which may include, at their absolute discretion, departure in case of poor performance, 
departure without the agreement of the Board, or detrimental competitive activity.

Pension and 
benefits

 – Generally pension and benefit provisions will continue to apply until the termination date.
 – Where appropriate other benefits may be receivable, such as (but not limited to) payments in lieu of accrued holiday, legal fees, 

tax advice costs in relation to the termination and outplacement support.

 – Benefits of relatively small value may continue after termination where appropriate, such as (but not limited to) mobile phone provision.

In exceptional circumstances, an arrangement may be established specifically to facilitate the exit of a particular individual albeit that any such 
arrangement would be made within the context of minimising the cost to the Group. We will only take such a course of action in exceptional 
circumstances and where it is considered to be in the best interests of shareholders.

Chair and Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
Our policy is for the Chair to review the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors annually following consultation with the Remuneration Committee 
Chair. Fees for the Chair are set by the Remuneration Committee.

Element

Policy

Fees

 – We aim to pay competitively for the role including consideration of the time commitment required. We benchmark the fees against an 

appropriate external comparator group. We pay a fee to our Chair which includes fees for chair of any committees. We pay a fee to each of our 
other Non-Executive Directors and they may receive an additional fee if they chair or are a member of a committee and/or hold the position of 
Senior Independent Director (although the Remuneration Committee does not currently intend to award additional fees for serving on a Board 
committee, other than for chairing that committee). Non-Executive Directors’ fee levels are set within the maximum level as approved by 
shareholders as part of our Articles of Association. We review the structure of fees from time to time and may, as appropriate, make changes to 
the manner in which total fees are structured, including but not limited to any additional chair or membership fees.

Allowances

 – Under a legacy arrangement, an allowance is payable each time certain non-Europe-based Non-Executive Directors are required to travel 

to attend Board and committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved. 

Incentives
Benefits

 – Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive plans. 
 – Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any benefit plans. The Company does not provide any contribution to their 

pension arrangements. The Chair is entitled to the use of a car and a driver whenever and wherever they are providing their services to or 
representing the Company. We have been advised that for Non-Executive Directors, certain travel and accommodation expenses in relation 
to attending Board meetings should be treated as a taxable benefit, therefore we also cover the tax liability for these expenses. 

Non-Executive Director letters of appointment
Non-Executive Directors are engaged on letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. The appointment of Non-Executive Directors 
may be terminated without compensation. Non-Executive Directors are generally not expected to serve for a period exceeding nine years. For further 
information refer to the Nominations and Governance Committee section of the Annual Report.

Annual Report on Remuneration

Remuneration Committee
In this section we give details of the composition of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) and activities undertaken during the 2023 financial 
year. The Committee’s function is to exercise independent judgement and consists only of the following independent Non-Executive Directors:

Chair: Valerie Gooding  
Committee members: Delphine Ernotte Cunci (appointed 8 November 2022), Michel Demaré and Dame Clara Furse

Following the announcement on 10 May 2023, Valerie Gooding and Dame Clara Furse will be stepping down from the Committee with effect from the 
conclusion of the 2023 AGM. Amparo Moraleda will join as Committee Chair with effect from the same date.

The Committee regularly consults with Margherita Della Valle, who was appointed as the Group Chief Executive effective 27 April 2023 (and also held 
the position on an interim basis effective 1 January 2023) and Leanne Wood, the Chief Human Resources Officer, on various matters relating to the 
appropriateness of awards for Executive Directors and senior executives, though they are not present when their own compensation is discussed. 
In addition, James Ludlow, the Group Reward and Policy Director, provides a perspective on information provided to the Committee, and requests 
information and analysis from external advisers as required. Maaike de Bie, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, advises the Committee 
on corporate governance guidelines and is Secretary to the Committee.

External advisers
The Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. The appointed advisers, WTW, were appointed 
by the Committee in 2007. The Chair of the Committee has direct access to these advisers as and when required, and the Committee determines the 
protocols by which these advisers interact with management in support of the Committee. The advice and recommendations of the external advisers are 
used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Committee member. Advisers attend Committee 
meetings occasionally, as and when required by the Committee.

WTW is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of 
Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. This is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due 
care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. WTW has confirmed that it adheres to that Code of Conduct throughout the year for all 
remuneration services provided to Vodafone and therefore the Committee is satisfied that it is independent and objective. The Remuneration Consultants’ 
Group Code of Conduct is available at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.

Treatment of corporate events

All of the Company’s share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control of the Company. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest 

and become exercisable on a change of control taking into account, in respect of GLTI awards, the extent to which, in the Remuneration Committee’s 

opinion, any relevant performance conditions are satisfied, the Company’s and the Executive Director’s performance, any other relevant factors and, 

unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed.

In the event of a demerger, distribution (other than an ordinary dividend) or other transaction which would affect the current or future value of any award, 

the Remuneration Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a change of control described above. Alternatively, an adjustment may 

be made to the number of shares if considered appropriate.

Payments for departing Executive Directors

In the table below we summarise the key elements of our Remuneration Policy on payments for loss of office. We will always comply both with the relevant plan 

rules and local employment legislation. The Remuneration Committee may make any statutory payment that is required in any relevant jurisdiction.

(‘GLTI’) on 

termination  

 – Up to 12 months’ base salary and contractual benefits (in line with the notice period). Notice period payments will either be made 

as normal (if the Executive Director continues to work during the notice period or is on gardening leave) or they will be made as 

monthly payments in lieu of notice (subject to mitigation if alternative employment is obtained).

 – The annual bonus may be pro-rated for the period of service during the financial year and will reflect the extent to which Company 

performance has been achieved. The annual bonus may be paid in such proportions of cash and shares, and subject to such 

deferral arrangements, as the Remuneration Committee may determine.

 – The Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust the entitlement to an annual bonus to reflect the individual’s performance 

and the circumstances of the termination.

Treatment of 

 – Normally, unvested GLTI awards will lapse when an Executive Director leaves the Group. However, an Executive Director’s award will 

vest in accordance with the terms of the plan to the extent determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account 

applicable performance conditions, the underlying performance of the Company and of the Executive Director and any other relevant 

incentive awards 

factors, if the Executive Director dies in service or leaves because of their ill health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or the 

sale of their employing company or business out of the Group or for any other reason determined by the Remuneration Committee, 

more than five months after the month in which the award is granted. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine 

under plan rules

whether the award will vest at the normal vesting date or earlier. The Remuneration Committee will determine the satisfaction of 

performance conditions applicable to the award. Awards will, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, be pro-rated 

for the proportion of the vesting period that had elapsed at the date the Executive Director leaves the Group.

 – The Remuneration Committee has discretion to vary the level of vesting as deemed appropriate, and in particular to determine that 

awards should not vest for reasons which may include, at their absolute discretion, departure in case of poor performance, 

Pension and 

 – Generally pension and benefit provisions will continue to apply until the termination date.

departure without the agreement of the Board, or detrimental competitive activity.

benefits

 – Where appropriate other benefits may be receivable, such as (but not limited to) payments in lieu of accrued holiday, legal fees, 

tax advice costs in relation to the termination and outplacement support.

 – Benefits of relatively small value may continue after termination where appropriate, such as (but not limited to) mobile phone provision.

In exceptional circumstances, an arrangement may be established specifically to facilitate the exit of a particular individual albeit that any such 

arrangement would be made within the context of minimising the cost to the Group. We will only take such a course of action in exceptional 

circumstances and where it is considered to be in the best interests of shareholders.

Chair and Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration

Chair. Fees for the Chair are set by the Remuneration Committee.

Element

Policy

Our policy is for the Chair to review the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors annually following consultation with the Remuneration Committee 

Fees

 – We aim to pay competitively for the role including consideration of the time commitment required. We benchmark the fees against an 

appropriate external comparator group. We pay a fee to our Chair which includes fees for chair of any committees. We pay a fee to each of our 

other Non-Executive Directors and they may receive an additional fee if they chair or are a member of a committee and/or hold the position of 

Senior Independent Director (although the Remuneration Committee does not currently intend to award additional fees for serving on a Board 

committee, other than for chairing that committee). Non-Executive Directors’ fee levels are set within the maximum level as approved by 

shareholders as part of our Articles of Association. We review the structure of fees from time to time and may, as appropriate, make changes to 

the manner in which total fees are structured, including but not limited to any additional chair or membership fees.

Allowances

 – Under a legacy arrangement, an allowance is payable each time certain non-Europe-based Non-Executive Directors are required to travel 

to attend Board and committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved. 

Incentives

 – Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive plans. 

Benefits

 – Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any benefit plans. The Company does not provide any contribution to their 

pension arrangements. The Chair is entitled to the use of a car and a driver whenever and wherever they are providing their services to or 

representing the Company. We have been advised that for Non-Executive Directors, certain travel and accommodation expenses in relation 

to attending Board meetings should be treated as a taxable benefit, therefore we also cover the tax liability for these expenses. 

Non-Executive Director letters of appointment

Non-Executive Directors are engaged on letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. The appointment of Non-Executive Directors 

may be terminated without compensation. Non-Executive Directors are generally not expected to serve for a period exceeding nine years. For further 

information refer to the Nominations and Governance Committee section of the Annual Report.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)

2023 remuneration
In this section we summarise the pay packages awarded to our Executive Directors for performance in the 2023 financial year versus 2022. Specifically, 
we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total remuneration 
figure for the year. The value of the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) reflects what was earned in respect of the year but will be paid out in cash in the following year. 
Similarly the value of the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) reflects the share awards which will vest in August 2023 as a result of the performance through the 
three-year period ended at the completion of our financial year on 31 March 2023.

Consideration of the use of discretion
The Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments of performance are 
fair and appropriate. If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting.

The Committee reviewed incentive outcomes at the May 2023 meeting and considered the appropriateness of outcomes in light of wider financial and 
business performance and the wider employee experience across the relevant measurement periods for both the short-term and long-term incentive 
plans. The Committee agreed the outcomes were appropriate and that no adjustments were required to either the short-term or long-term incentive 
outcomes this year,

Board changes
Throughout the year under review Margherita Della Valle held the position of Chief Financial Officer and, prior to her permanent appointment as Group 
Chief Executive on 27 April 2023, was also appointed Group Chief Executive on an interim basis effective 1 January 2023. Margherita’s 2023 single figure 
therefore reflects remuneration received in respect of her time in both of these executive positions, whereas her 2022 single figure reflects remuneration 
received solely in respect of her role as Chief Financial Officer.

In line with the reporting regulations, the single figure for Nick Read reflects remuneration received in respect of services rendered as a Board Director 
(i.e. from 1 April 2022 to 31 December 2022). The single figure table and supporting notes do not include values in respect of Nick’s employment 
between 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2023 nor contractual loss of office payments which can instead be found on page 99.

Financial metrics
As set out in the table above, service revenue and free cash flow finished above the mid-points of the respective target ranges whilst EBIT finished below 
the mid-point of the respective target range.

Customer appreciation KPIs
An assessment of performance under the customer appreciation KPIs measure was conducted on a market-by-market basis. Each market was assessed 
against a number of different metrics which included:

 – Churn – defined as total gross customer disconnections in the period divided by the average total customers in the period.
 – Revenue market share – based on our total service revenue and that of our competitors in the markets we operate in.
 – Net Promoter Score (‘NPS’) for both Consumer and Vodafone Business – defined as the extent to which our customers would recommend us.

All measures utilise data from our local markets which is collected and validated for quality and consistency by independent third-party agencies where 
possible. Further details on our performance against each key metric is set out below.

The business recorded positive churn results despite difficult and volatile market conditions linked to increasing price pressures. We experienced positive 
results across both mobile and fixed services in Portugal, and it was a particularly strong year for mobile churn in Italy, Turkey and South Africa. Network 
challenges in markets including Albania meant fixed service performance was more mixed although customer loyalty remained strong in a number of 
markets including the UK. 

 We continued to perform against revenue market share despite fierce competition across our markets. Strong performance was recorded in the UK, 
Egypt, Romania, and Ireland all of which demonstrated competitive resilience against this backdrop. Intense competition and increasing price pressures, 
particularly in some of our larger European markets, was also reflected in our overall position against this metric. 

Consumer NPS performance during the year saw us retain market leader or co-leader positions in several markets including Italy and Egypt, with Portugal, 
Albania and Tanzania all retaining a significant lead. We also improved or defended our position to ‘next-best’ competitor in the UK, Spain and South Africa, 
although faced challenges in Greece and Turkey.

Stable Business NPS performance was recorded in the year, reflected in leading positions retained or strengthened in several markets, including South 
Africa, Portugal and Albania. While there remains some market difficulties in Egypt and Spain, we have seen advancements in markets like Italy where we 
have attained a market leader position.

It is within this context that overall performance against our customer appreciation KPI metrics during the year was judged to be above the mid-point of 
the target range. The aggregated performance for the Group is calculated on a revenue-weighted average to give an overall achievement. The overall 
Group achievement for the year was 55.0% of maximum.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)

The adjusted free cash flow for the three-year period ended on 31 March 
2023 was €16.0 billion and equates to vesting under the FCF element 
of 72.7% of maximum.

The chart to the right shows that our TSR performance over the 
three-year period ended on 31 March 2023 was below the median 
of the peer group resulting in no vesting under this measure.

ESG performance across our three metrics was as follows:

 – GHG reduction – GHG reduction of 65% as at 31 March 2023 

from the FY17 baseline.

 – Women In Management – 34% representation of women 

in management at 31 March 2023.

 – M-Pesa – 53.2m connections at 31 March 2023.

The Committee reviewed the above performance and determined vesting 
under the ESG element of 95.3% of maximum. This reflected full 
achievement under the GHG reduction metric where the ambition was 
exceeded and the Women in Management metric where the ambition 
was achieved, and partial vesting under the M-Pesa metric where strong 
progress against the stretching ambition was made.

The adjusted free cash flow for the three-year period ended on 31 March 

2023 was €16.0 billion and equates to vesting under the FCF element 

2021 GLTI award: TSR performance

Growth in the value of a hypothetical US$100 holding 

over the performance period, six month averaging

of 72.7% of maximum.

The chart to the right shows that our TSR performance over the 

three-year period ended on 31 March 2023 was below the median 

of the peer group resulting in no vesting under this measure.

ESG performance across our three metrics was as follows:

 – GHG reduction – GHG reduction of 65% as at 31 March 2023 

from the FY17 baseline.

 – Women In Management – 34% representation of women 

in management at 31 March 2023.

 – M-Pesa – 53.2m connections at 31 March 2023.

The Committee reviewed the above performance and determined vesting 

under the ESG element of 95.3% of maximum. This reflected full 

achievement under the GHG reduction metric where the ambition was 

exceeded and the Women in Management metric where the ambition 

was achieved, and partial vesting under the M-Pesa metric where strong 

progress against the stretching ambition was made.

Notes:
1.  GLTI awards were granted as conditional share awards over shares with a value equal to the percentages of salary referred to on page 86. Margherita’s maximum vesting reflects the 2023 GLTI award made 
in July 2022 and the subsequent top-up GLTI award made in February 2023 following her change in role. Nick’s maximum vesting reflects the number of shares granted at maximum in July 2022 and 
which will be pro-rated for time worked (see page 99 for further details). Dividend equivalents on the shares that vest are paid in cash after the vesting date.

2.  Face value calculated based on the closing share price on 26 July 2022 (day immediately preceding the date of the July grant) of 122.4 pence. This share price was also used when calculating Margherita’s 

February 2023 grant.

Outstanding awards
The structure for awards made in August 2021 (vesting August 2024) and July 2022 (vesting July 2025) is set out on the previous page. Further details of 
the structure of these awards, and relevant targets, can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration of the relevant year.

All-employee share plans
During the year the Executive Directors were eligible to participate in the Vodafone Group Sharesave Plan which is a HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) 
approved scheme. Options under the plan are granted at up to a 20% discount to market value and Executive Directors’ participation is included in the 
option table on page 99.

Pensions (audited)
During the 2023 financial year, Margherita Della Valle accrued benefits under the defined contribution pension plan of £3,999.96, with the remainder of 
her 10% of base salary pension benefit for the year delivered as a cash allowance. Nick Read received a pro-rated cash allowance of 10% of base salary.

Margherita Della Valle has not participated in a Vodafone sponsored defined benefit scheme during her employment. Nick Read is a deferred member of 
the Vodafone Group Pension Scheme which closed to future accrual in 2010 before he was an Executive Director.

The Executive Directors are provided benefits in the event of death in service. In the event of ill health, an entitlement to benefit of two-thirds of base 
salary, up to a maximum benefit determined by the insurer, may be provided up until state pension age. In respect of the Executive Committee members, 
the Group has made aggregate contributions of £147,507 (2022: £143,175) into defined contribution pension schemes.

Alignment to shareholder interests (audited) 
Share ownership levels and requirements for individuals who held the position of Executive Director are set out in the table below. The values in respect of 
Margherita Della Valle reflect her ownership requirement as at 31 March 2023. Following her permanent appointment as Group Chief Executive on 27 
April 2023, Margherita’s ownership requirement was increased to 500% of salary.

As shown in the chart below, Margherita increased her shareholding level during the year but due to share price movement (93.85 pence for the 31 
March 2023 measurement compared to 126.61 pence used for the 2022 measurement), saw her ownership, as a percentage of salary and as calculated 
for these reporting purposes, decrease.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)

The shareholding requirements include a post-employment condition whereby the Executive Directors will need to continue to hold shares equivalent 
to the value of their requirement at the date of departure (or actual holding on departure if the requirement has not been reached during employment) 
for a further two years post-employment. The Committee has a number of processes in place to ensure this condition is met, including executives 
agreeing to these terms prior to receiving an award, executives holding the majority of their shares (and at least up to the value of their requirement) 
in a Company accessible account, and the Committee having the ability to lapse any unvested GLTI awards if the condition is not met.

Collectively the Executive Committee, including the Executive Director, owned 23,565,656 Vodafone shares at 31 March 2023, with a value of over 
£22.1 million. None of the Executive Committee members’ shareholdings amounts to more than 1% of the issued shares in that class of share, excluding 
treasury shares.

At 16 May 2023, and during the period from 1 April 2023 to 16 May 2023, no Director had any interest in the shares of any subsidiary company. Other than 
those individuals included in the tables above who were Board members at 31 March 2023, members of the Group’s Executive Committee at 31 March 2023 
had an aggregate beneficial interest in 21,324,393 ordinary shares of the Company. At 16 May 2023, the Directors had an aggregate beneficial interest 
in 3,325,930 ordinary shares of the Company and the Executive Committee members had an aggregate beneficial interest in 18,116,851 ordinary shares 
of the Company. The change in the number of shares held by the Executive Committee reflects a change in membership following the year-end, None 
of the Directors or the Executive Committee members had an individual beneficial interest amounting to greater than 1% of the Company’s ordinary shares.

At 16 May 2023, and during the period from 1 April 2023 to 16 May 2023, no Director had any interest in the shares of any subsidiary company. Other than 

those individuals included in the tables above who were Board members at 31 March 2023, members of the Group’s Executive Committee at 31 March 2023 

had an aggregate beneficial interest in 21,324,393 ordinary shares of the Company. At 16 May 2023, the Directors had an aggregate beneficial interest 

in 3,325,930 ordinary shares of the Company and the Executive Committee members had an aggregate beneficial interest in 18,116,851 ordinary shares 

of the Company. The change in the number of shares held by the Executive Committee reflects a change in membership following the year-end, None 

of the Directors or the Executive Committee members had an individual beneficial interest amounting to greater than 1% of the Company’s ordinary shares.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)

Pay in the wider context
Fair pay at Vodafone
As part of its review of executive remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes account of the pay policies in place across the wider business. 
This includes considering the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business to ensure there is a strong rationale for how packages 
evolve across the different levels of the organisation.

During the year the Committee reviewed the remuneration structure across the business, which included how our arrangements aligned with our 
strategy, supported our purpose, and celebrated the Spirit of Vodafone. The update also set out the results of the latest annual fair pay review, including 
where the key focus areas were and what actions had been agreed locally to implement any required adjustments.

In addition to being a core principle of the Committee, there is a clear culture in our business of ensuring we offer competitive and fair pay to all our 
people. Our approach across our business is guided by the six principles set out below. Our commitment to these principles is reflected in how the 
UK-based Living Wage Foundation has certified us as an Accredited Living Wage employer.

1. Market competitive
The pay of our people is reflective of their skills, role and function and the external market.

We annually review the pay of each person and actively manage any who fall below the market competitive range.

2. Free from discrimination
Our pay should not be affected by gender, age, disability, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, cultural heritage or belief.

We annually compare the average position of our men and women against their market benchmark, grade and function to identify and understand any 
differences and take action if necessary.

3. Ensure a good standard of living
We work with an independent organisation, the Fair Wage Network, to assess how our pay compares to the ‘living wage’ in each of our markets because 
we are committed to providing a good standard of living for our people and their families.

4. Share in our successes
All our people should have the opportunity to share in our success by being eligible to receive some form of performance-related pay, e.g. a bonus, shares 
or sales incentive.

5. Provide benefits for all
Our global standard is to offer all our people life insurance, parental leave and access to either Company or state provided healthcare and pension 
provision.

6. Open and transparent
We ensure that our people understand their pay. We do this through a series of user-friendly guides, webpages and an annual reward statement, which 
help explain our people’s pay and outline the value of their core reward package.

In addition, our people also receive monthly or weekly payslips and a payment schedule.

Cost of living actions
It is recognised that rising inflation levels and the subsequent cost of living crisis have impacted employees across a number of our markets this year. 
We have provided targeted support in a number of these locations, including the UK, Turkey and Egypt, to help alleviate the impact of these pressures 
and continue to monitor the market conditions across all of our locations’ entities. Such measures included additional or accelerated salary reviews, the 
provision of extra cash allowances, and the careful consideration of wider market conditions when setting salary budgets for the 2023 review. In the UK 
specifically, additional support has been provided to lower-paid employees who have been particularly impacted by increases to the consumer price 
index. This included a 10% base salary increase to employees with salaries of less than £25,000, whilst employees with a base salary of between £25,000 
and £35,000 received a £1,000 cash payment.

Stakeholder engagement
The Committee considers all stakeholder groups when setting executive pay including:

Employees
The Committee is fully briefed on pay arrangements across the business to ensure any decisions on executive pay are made within our wider business 
context and take into account wider employee pay conditions. We engage with our employees through a variety of means including employee forums, 
interactive webinars (including with our executives), global Spirit Beat surveys and digital platforms, all of which give our people the chance to voice their 
opinion on any area of interest, including all-employee and executive pay.

Shareholders
The Committee values the active participation of our shareholders during our consultations and fully considers all feedback as part of the review process.

Government
The Committee actively engages with external professional bodies and government departments when they issue consultations on proposed changes to 
legislation or reporting guidelines.

Wider society
The Committee is fully aware that society remains concerned about the risk of excessive executive pay practices in the wider market. The Committee 
believes that transparent reporting and active engagement in explaining both the operation of, and rationale for, executive pay decisions is key for 
businesses to retain trust in this area.

UK gender pay gap reporting
Each year we publish our UK gender pay gap in line with the statutory UK methodology. The nature of the statutory calculation means the gap will 
fluctuate year on year, influenced by changes in our business structure, Company performance and the percentage of men and women at all levels and 
positions. The existence of a UK gender pay gap in our business is primarily a consequence of more men than women holding senior or specialist, and 
therefore higher-paid, roles.

With our commitment to embed an inclusive culture, we continue our work to reduce the gap and have made good progress since the publication of 
our first report in 2017. Our global programmes aim to support women across different roles, areas, and geographies of our business and will, over time, 
reduce our specific UK gender pay gap which this year was calculated as 10.4% – a slight increase from our 2021 figure of 9.6%.

We have been recognised by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index as a leader in creating equity for women. We are proud of the policies that we have 
put in place to support our employees and we remain committed to addressing female representation at senior levels and the gender pay gap.

The calculation methodology used reflects Option B as defined under the relevant regulations. In line with the relevant regulations this utilises the most 
recently collected and disclosed data analysed within our Gender Pay Gap report, with employees at the three quartiles identified from this analysis and 
their respective single figure values calculated.

To ensure this data accurately reflects individuals at such quartiles, the single figure values for individuals immediately above and below the identified 
employee at each quartile within the gender pay gap analysis were also reviewed.

In recent years our ratios have remained relatively consistent, reflecting how the single figures for both the Chief Executive and employees at the quartile 
positions have remained stable when viewed over the period set out in the table above. In general we expect the ratios to be primarily driven by the 
valuation of the long-term incentive that is included in the Chief Executive’s single figure for the year.

Change in remuneration for Directors and all employees
In line with regulatory requirements, the table below calculates the percentage change in Directors’ remuneration (salary, taxable benefits and annual 
bonus payment) compared to the average remuneration for other Vodafone Group employees who are measured on comparable business objectives 
and who have been employed in the UK since 2021 (2021 to 2022) and 2022 (2022 to 2023) (per capita). Vodafone has employees based all around the 
world and some of these individuals work in countries with very high salary inflation; therefore Vodafone’s UK-based Group employees are deemed the 
most appropriate employee group for this comparison.

The year-on-year increase in Margherita Della Valle’s pay reflects Margherita’s appointment as Group Chief Executive on an interim basis, in addition to her 
existing role as Chief Financial Officer, effective 1 January 2023. This change in role during the year under review is therefore reflected in Margherita’s 
2023 figures compared to the 2022 figures which reflect Margherita’s role as Chief Financial Officer. The percentage increase in the table above does not 
reflect the actual increase during the year under review in respect of the salary payable for the role of Chief Executive which was increased by 3% effective 
1 July 2022.

The significant year-on-year increase in Deborah Kerr’s fees and taxable benefits reflect how the 2022 values reflect one month of service which covers 
the period between Deborah joining on 1 March 2022 and the year-end on 31 March 2022. By comparison, the 2023 figures reflect a full 12 months 
of time worked therefore resulting in a high year-on-year percentage increase despite there being no actual increase in the fees payable to the 
Non-Executive Directors during this period.

Whilst some of the percentages within the ‘Taxable benefits’ column look significant, these actually reflect relatively small increases in value when viewed 
on an absolute basis. Where an individual had no taxable benefit values in 2022 it has not been possible to calculate a percentage for the table above.

Assessing pay and performance
In the table below we summarise the Chief Executive’s single figure remuneration over the past 10 years and how our variable pay plans have paid 
out in relation to the maximum opportunity. This can be compared with the historic TSR performance over the same period. The chart below shows 
the performance of the Company relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Index over a 10-year period. The STOXX Europe 600 Index was selected as this 
is a broad-based index that includes many of our closest competitors. It should be noted that the TSR element of the 2021 GLTI is based on the TSR 
performance shown in the chart on page 96 and not this chart.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)

2024 remuneration
Details of how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for the 2024 financial year are set out below.

Prior to reviewing executive remuneration arrangements, including those of the Executive Committee, the Committee was fully briefed on remuneration 
arrangements elsewhere in the business. This included a detailed discussion of the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business, how 
pay at these levels is determined, and the findings of the latest annual fair pay review. The Committee also considered the external context and decisions 
made in relation to our wider employee population.

The cumulative effect of these discussions was that the Committee was able to make decisions in respect of executive remuneration in the context of the 
wider employee pay landscape within the business.1

2024 base salaries

Following her appointment to the position of Group Chief Executive, Margherita Della Valle’s salary was set at £1,250,000. The Committee decided the 
new salary was appropriate when compared against the external market using the Committee’s normal comparator groups of the EuroTop 25-75 and 
FTSE 30 (both excluding financial services companies), was fair from a gender pay perspective given its long standing work on fair pay and reflected both 
the responsibilities and demands of the role.

During the year no additional salary payment or allowance has been made to Margherita in respect of her carrying out the dual roles of Group Chief 
Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer. This will remain the approach going forward, and it is intended that Margherita will continue with her dual 
responsibilities until a new Group Chief Financial Officer is appointed.

Pension

Pension arrangements for Executive Directors will remain unchanged at 10% of salary, in line with the maximum employer contribution level for the wider 
UK population.

2024 annual bonus (‘GSTIP’)

Following its annual review of the GSTIP structure, the Committee agreed that the 2024 plan should support the strategic priorities of Growth and 
Customers. The constituent performance measures remain unchanged with the key change from the 2023 plan being separation of Net Promoter Score, 
revenue market share, and churn into standalone measures. The performance measures and weightings for 2024 are outlined below:

Growth (70% of total)
Service revenue (20%); adjusted EBIT (20%); adjusted free cash flow (20%); and revenue market share (10%)

Customers (30% of total)
Net Promoter Score1 (20%); and churn (10%).
Note:
1.  The assessment of NPS utilises data collected in our local markets which is validated for quality and consistency by independent third-party agencies.

Due to the potential impact on our commercial interests, annual bonus targets are considered commercially sensitive and therefore will be disclosed 
in the 2024 Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year.

Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) awards for 2024

Awards for 2024 will be made in line with the arrangements described in our policy on pages 89 and 90. Vesting of the 2024 award will be subject to 
adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award), and ESG (10% of total award) performance. Performance will be measured 
over the three financial years ending 31 March 2026, and any net vested shares will be subject to an additional two-year holding period. It is anticipated 
that the final awards will be reviewed by the Committee at the July 2023 meeting and, subject to the Committee’s approval, will be granted shortly 
afterwards.

Further details of the 2024 award targets are provided are on the following page.

Details of the final three-year adjusted free cash flow target range will be disclosed in the relevant market announcement at the time of grant and

Relative TSR (30% of total award)
Following the annual review of the performance measures which included a review of analysis provided by the Committee’s external advisers, 
the Committee determined that the TSR outperformance range for the 2024 award should be set at 7.0% p.a. at maximum.

The Committee further determined that the TSR peer group should remain unchanged for the 2024. Further details are set out in the tables below.

Each ambition for the 2024 award has been set by considering both our externally communicated targets and our internal progress as at 31 March 2023.

At the end of the performance period the Committee will assess achievement across the three metrics against the stated ambitions and determine 
vesting under this element. Full disclosure of the rationale for the final vesting decision will be provided in the relevant Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Our US listing requirements

2024 remuneration for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors

Fees for our Chair and Non-Executive Directors have been benchmarked against the FTSE 30 (excluding financial services companies). Following this 

year’s review it was agreed that the current fee levels, which are set out in the table below, would remain unchanged.

As Vodafone’s American Depositary Shares are listed on NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (‘NASDAQ’), we are required to disclose a summary of any material 
differences between the corporate governance practices we follow and those of US companies listed on NASDAQ. Vodafone’s corporate governance 
practices are primarily based on UK requirements but substantially conform to those required of US companies listed on NASDAQ.

The material differences are set out in the following table:

Board member independence

Committees

Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct

Quorum

Related party transactions

Shareholder approval

Different tests of independence for Board members are applied under the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and the NASDAQ listing rules. The Board is not required to take 
into consideration NASDAQ’s detailed definitions of independence as set out in the NASDAQ listing 
rules. The Board has carried out an assessment based on the independence requirements of the Code 
and has determined that, in its judgement, each of Vodafone’s Non-Executive Directors is independent 
within the meaning of those requirements.

The NASDAQ listing rules require US companies to have a nominations committee, an audit 
committee and a compensation committee, each composed entirely of independent directors, with 
the nominations committee and the audit committee each required to have a written charter which 
addresses the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, and the compensation committee having sole 
authority and adequate funding to engage compensation consultants, independent legal counsel and 
other compensation advisers.

 – Our Nominations and Governance Committee is chaired by the Chair of the Board and its other 

members are independent Non-Executive Directors.

 – Our Remuneration Committee is composed entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors.

 – Our Audit and Risk Committee is composed entirely of Non-Executive Directors, each of whom 

(i) the Board has determined to be independent based on the independence requirements of the 
Code; and (ii) meets the independence requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 – We have terms of reference for our Nominations and Governance Committee, Audit and Risk 

Committee and Remuneration Committee, all of which comply with the requirements of the Code 
and are available for inspection on our website at vodafone.com/governance.

 – These terms of reference are generally responsive to the relevant NASDAQ listing rules, but may not 

address all aspects of these rules.

Under the NASDAQ listing rules, US companies must adopt a Code of Conduct applicable to all 
directors, officers and employees that complies with the definition of a ‘Code of Ethics’ set out in 
section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 – We have adopted a Code of Ethics that complies with section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which 

is applicable only to the senior financial and principal executive officers.

Click to read our Code of Ethics: 
vodafone.com/governance

 – We have also adopted a separate Code of Conduct which applies to all employees. 

The quorum required for shareholder meetings, in accordance with our Articles of Association, is two 
shareholders, regardless of the level of their aggregate share ownership, while US companies listed 
on NASDAQ are required by the NASDAQ listing rules to have a minimum quorum of 33.33% of the 
holders of ordinary shares for shareholder meetings.

In lieu of obtaining an independent review of related party transactions for conflicts of interests 
in accordance with the NASDAQ listing rules, we seek shareholder approval for related party 
transactions that (i) meet certain financial thresholds, or (ii) have unusual features in accordance with 
the Listing Rules issued by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK (the ‘Listing Rules’), 
the Companies Act 2006 and our Articles of Association.

Further, we use the definition of a transaction with a related party as set out in the Listing Rules, which 
differs in certain respects from the definition of related party transaction in the NASDAQ listing rules.

When determining whether shareholder approval is required for a proposed transaction, we comply 
with both the NASDAQ listing rules and the Listing Rules. Under the NASDAQ listing rules, whether 
shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, among other things, the percentage 
of shares to be issued or sold in connection with the transaction. Under the Listing Rules, whether 
shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, among other things, whether the size 
of a transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the size of the listed company undertaking 
the transaction.

Directors’ statement of responsibility

The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations and keeping proper accounting 
records. Detailed below are statements made by 
the Directors in relation to their responsibilities, 
disclosure of information to the Company’s auditor, 
going concern and management’s report on 
internal control over financial reporting.

Financial statements and accounting records
Company law of England and Wales requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group at the end 
of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing those financial statements the Directors are required to:

 – Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
 – Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – Present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;

 – State whether the consolidated financial statements have been 

prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting 
Standards (‘IAS’), with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(‘IASB’) and with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 
2006 (the ‘Act’);

 – State for the Company’s financial statements whether applicable 

UK accounting standards have been followed; and

 – Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will 
continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with UK-adopted IAS, with IFRS as issued by the IASB and with the 
requirements of the Act. They are also responsible for the system 
of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group, and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ responsibility statement
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 
65 to 67, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:

 – The consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance 

with UK-adopted IAS, with IFRS as issued by the IASB and with the 
requirements of the Act, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group;

 – The parent company financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Company; and

 – The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 

performance of the business and the position of the Group, together 
with a description and robust assessment of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

The Directors are also responsible under section 172 of the Companies 
Act 2006 to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of 
its members as a whole and in doing so have regard for the needs of 
wider society and stakeholders, including customers, consistent with 
the Group’s core and sustainable business objectives.

Having taken advice from the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board 
considers the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and that it provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

Neither the Company nor the Directors accepts any liability to any person 
in relation to the Annual Report except to the extent that such liability 
could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person 
who has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading statement 
or omission shall be determined in accordance with section 90A and 
schedule 10A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

Disclosure of information to the auditors
Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of 
the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and 
the Directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.

Directors’ statement of responsibility (continued)

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, performance, position, principal risks and 
uncertainties and the Directors’ assessment of its long-term viability are 
set out on page 57.

In addition, the funding position of the Group is included in ‘Borrowings’ 
and ‘Capital and financial risk management’ in notes 21 and 22, 
respectively, to the consolidated financial statements. Notes 21 and 
22 include disclosure in relation to the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing as well as details regarding its capital, its financial 
risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
As noted on pages 177 to 178, the Group has access to substantial cash 
and financing facilities.

The Group also believes it adequately manages or mitigates its solvency 
and liquidity risks through two primary processes, described below.

Business planning process and performance management
The Group’s forecasting and planning cycle consists of in-year forecasts, 
a budget and a long-range plan. These generate income statement, cash 
flow and net debt projections for assessment by Group management 
and the Board. Each forecast is compared with prior forecasts and actual 
results to identify variances and understand the drivers of the changes 
and their future impact so management can take action where 
appropriate. Additional analysis is undertaken to review and sense check 
the key assumptions underpinning the forecasts.

Cash flow and liquidity reviews
The business planning process provides outputs for detailed cash 
flow and liquidity reviews, to ensure that the Group maintains adequate 
liquidity throughout the forecast periods. The prime output is a liquidity 
forecast which is prepared and updated at least on a monthly basis, which 
highlights the extent of the Group’s liquidity based on controlled cash 
flows and the headroom under the Group’s undrawn revolving credit 
facility. The key inputs into this forecast are:

 – Free cash flow forecasts with information taken from the business 

planning process;

 – Bond and other debt maturities; and
 – Expectations for shareholder returns, spectrum auctions and 

M&A activity.

The liquidity forecast is reviewed by the Group Chief Financial Officer 
and included in each of the reports to the Board. In addition, the Group 
continues to manage its foreign exchange and interest rate risks within 
the framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by 
the Board, with oversight provided by the Treasury Risk Committee.

The Directors have also considered sensitivities in respect of potential 
downside scenarios in concluding that the Group is able to continue 
in operation for the period to 30 June 2024 from the date of approving 
the consolidated financial statements. Those sensitivities include the 
non-refinancing, with the exception of hybrid bonds, of debt maturities 
in the assessment period. A reverse stress test was also reviewed to 
understand how severe conditions would have to be to breach liquidity 
including the required reduction in Adjusted EBITDAaL. The Directors also 
considered the availability of the Group’s €7.7 billion undrawn revolving 
credit facilities as at 31 March 2023.

In reaching their conclusion on the going concern assessment, 
the Directors also considered the findings of the work performed 
to support the statement on the long-term viability of the Group. 
As noted on page 57, this included key changes to relevant principal 
risks in light of global economic and political uncertainty, sensitivity 
analysis, scenario assessments, and combinations of these, over the 
viability assessment period.

Conclusion
Based on the review, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report and Accounts.

Controls over financial reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting for the Group.

The Group’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies 
and procedures that:

 – Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 

accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets;

 – Are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with UK-adopted IAS, with IFRS as issued 
by the IASB and with the requirements of the Act, and that receipts and 
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorisation 
of management and the Directors of the Company; and

 – Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Group’s assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

During the year covered by this report, there were no changes in the 
Group’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially 
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the effectiveness 
of the internal controls over financial reporting. 

Any internal control framework, no matter how well designed, has 
inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the 
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures, and may not 
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
