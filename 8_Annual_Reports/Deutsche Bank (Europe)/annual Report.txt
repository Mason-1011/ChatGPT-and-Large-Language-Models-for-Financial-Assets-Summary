Letter from the Chief Executive Officer 

Dear Shareholders, 

For the fourth year in a row, we look back on another year spent in a very challenging environment. In addition to the war in 
Ukraine, which is being waged with undiminished ferocity, a new war broke out between Israel and Hamas, which threatens 
to destabilize the entire Middle East and is also causing new economic disruptions. 

The resulting complex economic situation is one that confronts our clients with difficult choices. In a world where the balance 
of power is shifting and protectionism is on the rise, they need to position themselves correctly. They need to make urgent 
investments in the future at a time when interest rates and, consequently, financing costs have risen significantly. And they 
need to hedge against heightening risks. 

As a Global Hausbank, it is our task to support our clients at this time, shoulder to shoulder. Together, we want to find the 
right solutions and set the course for their successful future. With our strategic reorganisation in 2019 and the subsequent 
transformation, we are ideally positioned to deliver on this in the best possible way.  

The results for the past year are further proof that this strategy is working. As our clients are doing more business with us, our 
revenues  have  increased  by  6%  to  almost  € 29 billion.  At  the  same  time,  we  remained  disciplined  in  our  spending,  with 
adjusted costs growing at 3%, which was slower than inflation. Thanks to this operational strength, we were able to increase 
our pre-tax profit once again. At € 5.7 billion, it was 2% higher than the previous year's figure, the highest level in 16 years.  

The rating agency S&P Global recognised our renewed progress in December with a further rating upgrade. This should also 
have a positive impact on our future earnings. 

We want you to benefit from this success as well. We will propose a dividend of € 0.45 per share for the financial year 2023 
to the Annual General Meeting in May 2024. As in the previous year, this corresponds to an increase of 50%. In addition, we 
will buy back treasury shares worth  € 675 million in the first half of the year, after having already invested  € 450 million in 
share buybacks in 2023. 

Demonstrating resilience in an uncertain environment 

2023 was also a very successful year for us because we underpinned Deutsche Bank's stability and resilience when they 
were put to the test. In March, following bankruptcies at a number of regional banks in the United States and the takeover of 
Credit Suisse, our bank also came under pressure for a short time. But we withstood this pressure and quickly made it clear 
that there can be no doubt about our solidity.  

The full figures for the year are proof that these tumultuous days left no lasting marks. At the end of 2023, our deposits at 
€ 622 billion were back above the level at the end of 2022, after having fallen slightly during the market turbulences. 

We experienced equally little disruption to our business as a result of the difficult economic environment of the past year. Our 
risk managers have once again lived up to their first-class reputation. Building on our high-quality and well-diversified loan 
book, we were able to limit loan losses and loan loss provisions. The latter was  € 1.5 billion, or 31 basis points of average 
loans. This was only slightly above the forecast announced at the beginning of the year.

Our capital base is also extremely robust: the common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 13.7% at the end of the year, 
compared to 13.4% at the end of 2022. This was significantly higher than our target of around 13% for the period up to 2025. 
We owe this on the one hand to our continued capital discipline, which is reflected in the renewed reduction of risk-weighted 
assets; on the other, we are now operating so profitably that we are creating additional capital despite rising dividends.

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer 

Stable earnings mix shows strength of business model 

We owe this operational strength to all of our business divisions. As part of our strategic reorganization, we set ourselves the 
goal of aligning our bank around four strong pillars that complement each other and give us stability in different market phases. 

Our revenue mix last year shows how far we have come in this area, with almost four-fifths of our revenues coming from 
businesses that provide reliable returns. And these were very well distributed across all four divisions. Of course, our Corporate 
Bank and Private Bank in particular benefited from higher global interest rates. However, the bank's strong full-year figures 
would not have been possible if the Investment Bank and our Asset Management had not also made a lot out of a difficult 
market environment.  

Specifically, our divisions have developed as follows: 

The Corporate Bank increased its revenues by 22%, up to € 7.7 billion. All businesses achieved double-digit growth. In addition 
to  net interest  income,  we  also  owe  this  to  product innovations  and  investments  in  customer  service  in  core  markets  and 
growth areas. 

At € 9.2 billion, revenues in the Investment Bank were 9% lower than in the very strong previous year. Significant revenue 
growth in the Origination & Advisory business did not offset the declines in the Fixed Income & Currency business. By the end 
of the year, however, there were already clear signs of recovery, with the Investment Bank's revenues increasing by 10% year 
on year in the final quarter. 

The Private Bank generated revenues of € 9.6 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the previous year. This growth would 
have been twice as strong if adjusted for one-off effects such as the sale of Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors in Italy. The 
largest increases were recorded in the deposits business, particularly in the Private Bank Germany, which also accounted for 
a significant part of the high net inflows of € 29 billion. However, the positive result here was clouded by what were, in part, 
considerable  delays  and  restrictions  for  some  clients  following  the  migration  of  Postbank's  IT  environment  to  a  common 
platform. Here, we failed to meet our clients’ expectations. In recent months, we have significantly reduced the backlog, for 
instance with the help of additional staff. At the same time, we have revised and partially automated various processes to 
prevent something similar from happening in the future. 

In our Asset Management business, revenues declined by 9% to € 2.4 billion. This was mainly due to reduced management 
fees as a result of market value losses and slightly lower margins. At the same time, assets under management grew by 
€ 75 billion, including € 28 billion in net inflows. This creates the basis for future fee income. 

Increased investments lay the foundation for future success 

As a result, we have established a strong market position in all four business divisions. And we see potential to expand it 
further. That is why we made more investments in 2023 to accelerate our growth trajectory and take advantage of market 
opportunities.  

To this end, we have driven product innovations and hired personnel in some key areas to improve our market coverage, 
especially in areas where we can score points with clients with our high-quality expertise and advice. This includes our Wealth 
Management business, Client Coverage in the Corporate Bank and Origination & Advisory in the Investment Bank. We have 
decisively strengthened the latter with the acquisition of the leading British corporate broker Numis.  

At the same time, we have continued to invest in technology, stringent processes and platforms, and our controls. In recent 
years, we have focused our investments here in order to meet the regulatory requirements and to effectively protect the bank. 
After investing more than € 1 billion again in improvements to our controls in 2023, we now assume that the remediation work 
on our most important regulatory programmes is now nearing completion. 

In terms of costs, we are also at a turning point. In 2023, we deliberately put some major cost items behind us. In addition to 
investments in business, technology and controls, this included restructuring and severance costs related to the transformation 
strategy and extraordinary items such as amortization of goodwill at Numis. A large part of these costs will not repeat from 
2024, which is why noninterest expenses should have reached their peak last year at € 21.7 billion.

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer 

Outlook: on track to hit return target, with greater ambition for revenues 

For the coming years, we expect a clear decline in costs. On the one hand, investments in technology, processes and controls 
will increasingly translate into savings; on the other, savings from efficiency measures will reduce our cost base. In 2023, we 
further optimized our branch network. In addition, we launched a program to cut around 3,500 jobs by means of automation 
and the elimination of duplicate functions, especially for non-client-facing roles. 

Our goal is to arrive at a cost level that means the bank is protected against external influences in an uncertain environment. 
We see this level at around € 20 billion per year, and we want to reach it in 2025. Cost discipline is a top priority, and it is a 
prerequisite for us to achieve our goals. By the end of 2025, we aim to achieve a cost/income ratio of below 62.5% and a post-
tax return on tangible equity at above 10%. And we have a clear path towards these goals. 

Another important factor in this is our improved revenues outlook. Our original target was to achieve compound annual revenue 
growth of 3.5 to 4.5% for the years 2021 to 2025. In recent years, averaging around 7%, we have far exceeded this target and 
we are confident that we will continue to grow at a stronger pace. We have therefore raised our target for 2021 to 2025 to 
compound  annual  revenue  growth  of  5.5  to  6.5%.  By  the  end  of  2025, this  would  translate  to  annual  revenues  of  around 
€ 32 billion. 

In  line  with  our  ambitious  financial  targets,  we  expect  to  be  able  to  further  increase  capital  distributions  to  you,  our 
shareholders, in the coming years. We have set ourselves a capital distribution goal of 8 billion euros in respect of the financial 
years 2021 to 2025, paid in 2022 to 2026, and we believe we are in a good position to exceed this objective based on the 
achievement of our financial targets. For the 2025 financial year, we are aiming for a dividend of € 1.00 per share, subject to 
it being consistent with a 50% payout ratio.  

That said, we are aware that the economic environment will remain difficult for the time being. With our diversified business 
model, however, we believe we are well positioned for further growth, even in a challenging environment. At the core of our 
strategy as a Global Hausbank is our ambition to accompany our clients at all stages, as a strong partner, who gives them 
financial  security  and  works  with  them  to  achieve  their  long-term  success.  Our  clients’  response  to  this  and  the  growing 
demand for our products and services reinforce our belief that we are on the right track with this strategy. This gives us the 
strength and confidence to focus our plans on Deutsche Bank’s future. We have a clear ambition: to continue our growth 
trajectory and be a leading European bank.  

Knowing that you are at our side is both a pleasure and an incentive for us. 

Thank you for placing your trust in Deutsche Bank. 

Kind regards,

Annual Report 2023 

Letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board 

Letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board 

Dear Shareholders, 

Last year, Deutsche Bank proved its resilience in a volatile environment, further increasing revenues and delivering its best 
pre-tax profit in 16 years. Thanks to its prudent risk management, the bank has a strong and stable balance sheet and has 
further strengthened its capital base. As a result, we are this year once again in a position to substantially increase capital 
distributions to shareholders and we are pleased that the Supervisory Board and Management Board will propose to you a 
50% increase in the dividend to € 0.45 per share at this year's Annual General Meeting. 

In this economic environment, the resilience and sustainable profitability of our bank were also focus topics for the Supervisory 
Board.  It  was  the  Risk  Committee’s  task  to  keep  an  eye  on  our  capital  adequacy  as  well  as  to  oversee  the  bank's  risk 
management  and  the  development  of  non-financial  risks.  Another  priority  was  to  set  the  course  for  future  growth.  The 
Supervisory Board closely monitored the strategic development of the bank’s culture and business model together with its 
financial targets and capital objectives up to 2025. The Supervisory Board expressly supports the bank’s even sharper focus 
on its role as a Global Hausbank. Part of this is supporting clients in their sustainable and digital transformation. This strategy 
not only enables the bank to play its role within the German and European economy but also – of this the Supervisory Board 
is  convinced  –  it  is  the  right  way  to  generate  sustainable  profits  and  returns  for  you  as  shareholders.  In  this  context,  the 
Supervisory Board welcomes and supports the Management Board’s work on clearly defining the bank’s purpose, its vision 
and aspirational culture, guided by the conviction that our top priority must be an even stronger focus on placing our clients at 
the center of everything we do.  

Effective controls protect both our bank and our clients. Further improving these controls was another important topic last 
year. The Supervisory Board regularly discussed significant regulatory issues as well as progress in the processing of material 
litigation  cases.  We  are  aware that  there  is  still  more  to  do.  The  Management  Board  and  Supervisory  Board  are  in  close 
dialogue with regulators and are focused on delivering the necessary improvements. To achieve this, the bank spent about 
€ 1.2 billion on controls in 2023 and hired around 1,000 dedicated professionals across all regions. More details on these 
important issues can be found in Deutsche Bank’s Non-Financial Report, which is published in parallel with this Annual Report. 

One of the issues that the Supervisory Board addressed intensively last year was the restrictions for our clients following the 
migration of Postbank’s IT to a common platform. The Management Board regularly reported to the Supervisory Board on the 
progress made in resolving the backlogs that had arisen, which were able to be reduced substantially over the past months. 
Nevertheless, it is clear that we have not lived up to our service and quality standards here and have disappointed our clients. 
On behalf of the Supervisory Board I would like to express my sincere apologies for the delays and problems caused to our 
clients. The Supervisory Board has taken action as a result and reduced the variable compensation of several current and 
departed Management Board members. Details can be found in our Compensation Report.  

There you will also find information on how we intend to develop the Management Board compensation system for 2024 and 
beyond. In  our  review,  we  incorporated  feedback  from  investors  and  are addressing  two  main  concerns:  first,  we  want to 
simplify the system, making it more transparent for our external stakeholders, by significantly reducing the number of targets 
and  indicators  on  which  variable  compensation  depends.  Second,  we  aim  to  align  how  we  evaluate  Management  Board 
members’  performance  even  more  closely  with  the  interests  of  our  shareholders.  This  applies  above  all  to  the  long-term 
component of variable compensation, which in future will no longer be measured against past years’ results. In the new system, 
both financial and ESG targets will be forward-looking over a period of three years. In addition, we aim to be more ambitious 
when it comes to setting targets for certain key performance indicators. We will submit the revised compensation system to 
you for voting at the Annual General Meeting in May; it is to be applied as early as this year. 

In  2023,  the  Supervisory  Board  also  addressed  personnel  decisions  in  the  Management  Board.  At  the  Annual  General 
Meeting, we bid farewell to Christiana Riley, Americas CEO, and Karl von Rohr, President and Head of Private Bank, who left 
the  bank  at  the  end  of  October after 25  years of  service.  Claudio  de  Sanctis subsequently  assumed responsibility  for the 
Private Bank and joined the Management Board in July. He has been with Deutsche Bank since 2018 and has successfully 
transformed the International Private Bank in recent years and focused it on its strengths in the advisory business. Stefan 
Simon assumed responsibility for the Americas region – in addition to his global responsibility for Legal, Regulatory Affairs 
and  Anti-Financial  Crime.  Besides  client  coverage,  the  structure  of  the  US  market  requires  significant  coordination  and 
dialogue  with  regulators.  Responsible  for  maintaining  closer  connections  between  the  regions  and  our  home  market  is 
Alexander von zur Mühlen. He assumed responsibility for Germany and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in July. He 
also continues to oversee the Asia-Pacific region. Rebecca Short was given an extended mandate on the Management Board 
with a view to making the bank more efficient. In addition to her responsibility for Human Resources, she was appointed Chief 
Operating Officer with overall responsibility for the Group's costs.  

VI 

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board 

As part of personnel reorganization measures, the Management Board was reduced from ten to nine members to make it 
more efficient. With this new composition, we do, however, fall short of our own commitment regarding the share of women 
on the Management Board. The Supervisory Board is focused on raising the proportion of women in leadership roles, both at 
Management Board level and below. As part of the bank’s new compensation system, we seek to integrate the latter more 
firmly into the performance goals of our Management Board members.  

On the Supervisory Board, there was a routine change as a result of last year’s elections, with Susanne Bleidt, Claudia Fieber, 
Brigit  Laumen,  Gerlinde  Siebert,  Frank  Schulze,  Stephan  Szukalski  and  Jürgen  Tögel  being  newly  elected  as  employee 
representatives, while Jan Duscheck, Manja Eifert and Timo Heider were re-elected for a further term of office. In January 
2024, Birgit Laumen resigned from her mandate and the court subsequently appointed Florian Haggenmiller as her successor. 
I would like to once again welcome all those who joined the Supervisory Board. My special thanks go to Frank Schulze, one 
of my deputies, for the close cooperation and partnership since the very beginning. 

On the shareholder side, continuity was the order of the day. Four shareholder representatives, whose term of office expired 
in  2023,  were  each  re-elected  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  for  another  four  years.  We  look  forward  to  continuing  our 
valuable collaboration with Mayree Clark, John Thain, Michele Trogni and Norbert Winkeljohann.  

In 2024, our Annual General Meeting will again be held virtually. The experience of the past few years has convinced us to 
take this step; this inclusive format offers numerous benefits. We have received recognition for the transparent implementation 
and quality of the answers to shareholder questions, which will again be submitted in advance this year. At the same time, we 
aim to enable an enhanced dialogue with shareholders on the day of the Annual General Meeting.  

Dear shareholders, the Supervisory Board is confident that your Deutsche Bank is on the right track. The bank has the right 
set-up and a strong management team. We will do everything we can to support them in the next phase of their growth strategy 
and to put our clients at the heart of everything we do. I am convinced that if we focus on our clients and our strengths, we will 
continue to create sustainable value for you, our shareholders.  

Sincerely, 

Alex Wynaendts 

Chairman of the Supervisory Board

Report of the Supervisory Board 

In the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board performed all the tasks assigned to it by law and regulatory requirements as 
well as those pursuant to the Articles of Association and Terms of Reference.  

The Management Board informed us regularly, without delay and comprehensively of all matters with relevance for our bank, 
and in particular on business policies and strategy, in addition to fundamental issues relating to the company’s management 
and  culture,  corporate  planning  and  control,  compliance  and  compensation  systems.  It  reported  to  us  on  the  financial 
development, earnings and risk situation, the bank’s liquidity, capital and risk management, the technical and organizational 
resources as well as business transactions and events that were of significant importance to the bank. We were involved in 
decisions of fundamental importance to the bank. As in previous years, the Management Board provided us, in accordance 
with our requests, with enhanced reporting on several topic areas, for example: The combating of financial crime and the 
ongoing  development  of  the  related  controls,  the  progress  in  remediating  regulatory  enforcement  actions  and  the  related 
critical findings, as well as important interactions with various regulators.  

In  addition  to  regulatory  issues,  the  Supervisory  Board  extensively  addressed  the  situation  in  the  Private  Bank  and  the 
limitations for our clients following the migration of Postbank’s IT to one shared platform. The Management Board regularly 
reported to the Supervisory Board on the progress made in resolving the resulting backlogs, and these have been substantially 
reduced over the past months. 

Promoting diversity on the Management Board of Deutsche Bank is very important to the Supervisory Board, and it will be 
intensively  addressing  the  topic  in  the  future,  too.  The  Supervisory  Board  plenum  and  Nomination  Committee  deliberated 
several times on the status and measures in this context and discussed them together with the Management Board. For the 
selection of suitable members for the Management Board, the Nomination Committee takes into account the balance and 
diversity  of  the  knowledge,  skills  and  experience  of  all  the  Management  Board  members.  It  also  actively  seeks  to  foster 
diversity on the Management Board, for example, with regard to gender, nationality and age, as well as different backgrounds 
and mindsets. A special focus has been placed in this context on raising the proportion of women in leadership roles, both on 
the Management Board and at the levels below. 

In several meetings, we discussed together with the Management Board the actual and aspired state of the corporate culture, 
the  progress  made  as  well  as  the  actions  to  achieve  the  related  objectives.  The  discussion  focused  on  the  values  and 
behaviors  we  would  like  to  promote  together  in  the  bank  overall.  The  Management  Board  established  a  program  clearly 
defining  the  bank’s  purpose,  its  vision  and  aspirational  culture  to  further  develop  the  bank’s  corporate  culture  that  will  be 
launched in 2024. 

The Supervisory Board Chairman and the committee chairs regularly had discussions with the Management Board between 
the meetings. They also consulted each other on the meeting agendas for the respective committees they chair and discussed 
topics  of  overarching  importance  for  the  Supervisory  Board.  Furthermore,  upcoming  decisions  were  deliberated  on  and 
prepared in discussions conducted regularly between the Management Board and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board as 
well  as  the  chairs  of  the  Supervisory  Board  committees.  In  addition,  the  Management  Board  invited  us  to  a  total  of  four 
information events on various current topics. Characteristic for our cooperation with the Management Board was our focus on 
working together responsibly in a spirit of mutual trust for the successful further development of the company. 

There were a total of 55 meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees. These were conducted as meetings with 
physical attendance, video conferences or as hybrid meetings (with both on-site and virtual participation). When meetings 
were  convened  as  video  conferences,  a  room  was  also  available  for  all  members  to  participate  on  the  bank’s  premises. 
Between the meetings, resolutions were adopted, when necessary, through circulation voting procedure.

Meetings of the Supervisory Board 

We held a total of eight meetings; seven were as regularly scheduled and one was an extraordinary meeting. Two meetings 
were conducted with physical attendance and six as hybrid meetings.  

Again over the past year, we focused in particular on geopolitical and economic developments and their effects on the bank. 
We  discussed developments in  the  banking  sector both in  Europe  and  in  the  USA. At several  meetings,  we  had  in-depth 
discussions with the Management Board about the status of processing in the Private Bank. We focused in several meetings 
on  the  effective  implementation  and  further  development  of  the  bank’s  strategy  and  corporate  culture.  Together  with  the 
Management Board, we deliberated on these reports and on the regular progress reports on the individual business divisions, 
infrastructure areas and regions. Also, we regularly discussed regulatory issues and proceedings that affect our bank around 
the world, significant litigation cases and the progress made in the remediation of findings. Furthermore, we addressed the 
appointments  of  members  to  the  committees  as  well  as  the  corresponding  committee  tasks,  and  adopted  the  relevant 
resolutions in this context. 

At our first meeting on February 1, we addressed the actual financial results and the planned key figures for the year 2022 as 
well as analysts’ estimates. Deviations were discussed in detail. We confirmed the Management Board’s preliminary proposal 
for the dividend, while also taking into account the regulatory requirements for capital funding, and we addressed the planning 
for 2023-2025, the investment portfolio 2023, as well as the development of business and management measures with regard 
to the ongoing investigations at DWS. The Management Board reported to us on the status  of the consolidation of the IT 
platforms of Postbank and Deutsche Bank and the related challenges in this. We noted the draft of the Corporate Governance 
Statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Com¬mercial Code (HGB) with approval. While taking into 
account recommendations of the Compensation Control Committee and following consultations with the bank’s Compensation 
Officer and independent external compensation consultants, we determined the level of the variable compensation for the 
Management Board members for the 2022 financial year. In this context, we also discussed the respective Management Board 
members’  achievement  levels  for  2022  and  the  plan  rules  for  the  year  2023,  and  we  set  long-term  objectives  for  the 
Management Board along with the relevant measurement criteria for the 2023 performance period. Furthermore, we discussed 
the annual assessment of the structure, size, composition and performance of the Management Board and the Supervisory 
Board in accordance with Section 25d (11) of the German Banking Act (KWG). 

At our second meeting on March 16, after the Management Board’s reporting and a discussion with the auditor, and based on 
the  Audit  Committee’s  recommendation,  we  approved  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  Annual  Financial 
Statements  for  2022  and  agreed  to  the  Management  Board’s  proposal  for  the  appropriation  of  distributable  profit.  We 
addressed the financial accounting system, the system of internal controls and the risk management system and discussed 
the  assessments  of  the  Management  Board  and  auditor  of  their  appropriateness  and  effectiveness.  Based  on  the  Audit 
Committee’s recommendation, we determined that there are no objections to be raised regarding the Group’s separate Non-
Financial Report in accordance with Section 315c of the German Commercial Code (HGB) in conjunction with Sections 289c 
to 289e HGB as well as the European Union’s (EU) Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted in this context, 
also based on the final results of our own inspections. The Management Board reported to us on market developments and 
developments in the banking sector both in Europe and in the USA, the ongoing investigations at DWS, as well as the status 
of remediation of regulatory enforcement actions and the related critical findings. The Management Board presented a report 
to  us  on  the  structure  of  the  compensation  systems  and  the  Human Resources  Report  for  2022.  We  also  discussed  and 
approved the Report of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, we addressed the topics for the General Meeting and approved 
the proposals for the agenda. At the proposal of the Compensation Control Committee, we discussed the proposal to adjust 
the  structure  of  Supervisory  Board  compensation  and  a  corresponding  resolution  proposal  for  the  General  Meeting. 
Furthermore, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board adopted the resolutions necessary to exercise the 
shareholder rights in subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft in accordance with Section 32 of the Co-Determination 
Act (MitbestG). We noted the report of the Management Board on changes in the regional advisory councils in Germany in 
accordance with Section 8 of the Articles of Association. 

At our extraordinary meeting on April 26, we addressed Ms. Riley’s departure from the bank as of May 31, 2023, and Mr. von 
Rohr’s  as  of  October  31,  2023.  We  deliberated  on  the  joint  proposal  of  the  Nomination  Committee  and  the  Chairman’s 
Committee that Mr. Claudio de Sanctis be appointed to the Management Board as the successor to Mr. von Rohr and resolved 
to approve this. We addressed the size of the Management Board, which was reduced from ten to nine members once the 
changes at the Management Board level became effective. Furthermore, we approved the proposals for adjustments to the 
Management Board members’ areas of functional responsibility. The Management Board gave us an overview of the results 
for the first quarter of 2023 and an update on strategy.

Report of the Supervisory Board 

On May 16 representatives of the Joint Supervisory Team presented the results of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation 
Process (SREP 2022) along with key observations and the supervisory priorities for the years 2023-2025 as well as the Joint 
Supervisory Team’s book of work for Deutsche Bank for the year 2023. Subsequently, we discussed these topics with the 
Joint Supervisory Team and the timeframe for their implementation, and the corporate culture. We also addressed the pending 
General Meeting and adopted the resolution on the Chair of the General Meeting. The Management Board reported to us on, 
among other things, market developments and volatility in the market following the developments in connection with Silicon 
Valley Bank and the effects on the bank, the ongoing investigations at DWS as well as the development and status of the 
remediation of regulatory enforcement actions and the related critical findings. 

At our constitutive meeting on May 17 directly after the General Meeting, we elected Mr. Alexander Wynaendts as Chairman 
of the Supervisory Board until the expiry of his mandate, Mr. Frank Schulze as first Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
and Professor Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann as second Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, we resolved to 
approve appointments of members to our committees following the personnel changes on the Supervisory Board and the 
publication of our updated Matrix of Skills. We resolved to issue the audit mandate to EY, who had been elected by the General 
Meeting as the auditor of the annual and consolidated financial statements.  

At our meeting on July 27, we addressed Management Board compensation and carried out the necessary adjustments of the 
objectives based on a recommendation of the Compensation Control Committee in light of the changed areas of responsibility 
at the Management Board level. The Management Board reported to us on the reactions of the market and our stakeholders 
to the publication of the Interim Report and on the measures launched by the Management Board to accelerate the growth 
trajectory with regard to the targets by the year 2025. The Management Board reported to us on the current developments at 
DWS, the development of its business, its governance and the measures taken by its management relating to the ongoing 
investigations. We discussed together with the Management Board the business and IT activities in Russia and the timeline 
for the orderly downsizing of the business. Furthermore, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board adopted 
the resolutions necessary to exercise the shareholder rights in subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft in accordance 
with Section 32 of the Co-Determination Act (MitbestG). Together with the Management Board, we discussed the corporate 
culture, regulators’ expectations and the program sponsored by the Management Board for the further development of the 
corporate culture. 

Within the framework of our meeting on October 25 and 26, we resolved to approve the Declaration of Conformity pursuant 
to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Together with the Management Board, we extensively deliberated 
on Group strategy and the business strategies of the business divisions as well as the corporate culture and the definition of 
the bank’s purpose and its vision. The Management Board reported to  us on the operating  business model, including the 
impacts on costs, and the bank’s technology strategy aligned to the business strategy. We also addressed the status of the 
consolidation of the IT platforms of Postbank and Deutsche Bank and the process of working through the resulting delays and 
limitations for clients. 

At  our  meeting  on  December  14,  representatives  of  the  Joint  Supervisory  Team  presented  the  results  of  the  Supervisory 
Review  and  Evaluation  Process  (SREP  2023)  along  with  related  regulatory  proposals  and  recommendations,  which  we 
subsequently discussed together. The Management Board reported to us on the development of business and the strategic 
priorities for the year 2024 as well as on the progress in remediating the portfolio of open regulatory enforcement measures 
and critical external findings in 2023. Together with the Management Board, we discussed the corporate culture against the 
backdrop of the bank’s purpose and vision as well as the implementation measures planned in this context for the year 2024. 
The Management Board reported to us on the preliminary strategy and capital plan for 2024 to 2026 as well as the situation 
in Postbank and on the progress made in working through the backlogs.

Report of the Supervisory Board 

Committees of the Supervisory Board 

The members of the individual committees and the changes during the financial year are specified the Corporate Governance 
Statement in the Annual Report. 

The Chairman’s Committee held nine meetings in the reporting period – six meetings were with physical attendance and three 
were video conferences. Seven ordinary meetings took place and two extraordinary meetings (including one together with the 
Nomination Committee). The Chairman’s Committee addressed Management Board and Supervisory Board matters in depth, 
in  addition  to  corporate  governance  and  ongoing  topics  between  the  meetings  of  the  Supervisory  Board  as  well  as  the 
preparations for them. This included addressing the preparations for changes on the Management Board in consultation with 
the Nomination Committee, the preparation of the revised versions of our terms of reference and Supervisory Board-internal 
documents as well as topics in preparation for the General Meeting. The Committee also addressed the topic of the business-
related use and monitoring of electronic communications, the state of services within the Private Bank and a series of special 
topics.  Furthermore,  the  Committee  addressed  the  mandates  of  the  Management  Board  members and  the  assumption  of 
costs for (former) members of the Management Board. 

In 2023, the Risk Committee met six times – two meetings with physical attendance and four as video conferences. As in 
previous years, the Risk Committee focused on periodically recurring topics such as the annual appetite statement of  the 
company, the internal process to ensure capital adequacy and the internal process to ensure an appropriate liquidity position. 
A key focus of the Committee at several meetings last year was on the topic of Non-Financial Risk in general, but also in 
particular with regard to specific risk types. As a regular item, the business division-specific risk appetites were assessed, in 
particular those of the Private Bank and DWS. In addition, the Committee obtained reports on significant political and economic 
developments  such  as  the  Israel-Gaza  conflict,  tensions  between  China  and  Taiwan  as  well  as  developments  in  the 
commercial real estate sector. Furthermore, the Committee addressed the bank’s core transformation initiatives relating to the 
Risk  function.  With  regard  to  the  regulators’  priorities,  the  Committee  focused,  for  example,  on  the  bank-internal  risk 
management in general, the framework for recognizing provisions, non-financial risks and the topic of sustainability. Finally, 
the  Committee  addressed  the  general  framework  with  regard  to  product  structure,  the  capital  planning  for  the  individual 
business divisions and changes in the credit models and the respective effects on the bank’s capital. 

The Audit Committee met five times in 2023. Five meetings were conducted with attendance on-site and four were held as 
video conferences. The areas of focus included addressing the impacts of the developments in the banking sector both in 
Europe  and  in  the  USA  for  the  bank’s  accounting  statements  and  the  new  requirements  for  Environmental,  Social  and 
Governance  (ESG)  reporting.  Furthermore,  the  Committee  regularly  addressed  the  monitoring  of  the  effectiveness  of  the 
control functions (in particular, Compliance, Anti-Money Laundering function, Group Audit). The monitoring the Management 
Board  in  the  remediation  of  findings  related  to  the  Know-Your-Customer  (KYC)  processes  was  another  focal  point  of  the 
Committee’s  work,  in  addition  to  the  Findings  Management  program  for  the  accelerated  reduction  of  critical  findings.  In 
addition, the Committee addressed, against the backdrop of Wirecard’s insolvency, the potential implications for the auditor 
of our annual and consolidated financial statements, in particular with regard to the auditor’s independence. 

The Nomination Committee met a total of six times during the reporting period, including one extraordinary meeting together 
with the Chairman’s Committee. Four meetings were conducted on-site, and two meetings were held as video conferences. 
The Nomination Committee extensively addressed succession planning for the Management Board and Supervisory Board in 
consideration of the statutory and regulatory requirements and diversity principles. In this context, the Nomination Committee 
addressed in consultation with the Chairman’s Committee the changes on the Management Board resulting from the departure 
from the Management Board of Ms. Riley and Mr. von Rohr. Furthermore, the Committee resolved to recommend that the 
Supervisory Board nominate Ms. Mayree Clark, Mr. John Thain, Ms. Michele Trogni and Professor Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann 
for re-election to the Supervisory Board at the General Meeting. In addition, the Committee addressed the composition of the 
Supervisory Board committees, the induction of new members of the Supervisory Board and of the Management Board, the 
Management Board’s training measures, the regular review of our internal policies and procedures, as well as topics related 
to the (“fit and proper”) suitability of members of the Supervisory Board and Management Board. Other topics included the 
annual assessment of the Supervisory Board and Management Board in accordance with Section 25d (11) of the German 
Banking Act (KWG) and the advancement of diversity.

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Report of the Supervisory Board 

The Compensation Control Committee met seven times in 2023. Two meetings were conducted on-site, four meetings were 
video conferences, and one was held as a hybrid meeting. At its meetings, the Committee focused in particular on monitoring 
the structure of the compensation systems for the Management Board and for employees. The Committee submitted proposals 
for the objectives for the year 2023 and for determining the variable compensation of the Management Board for the year 
2022. The Committee also addressed personnel-related changes on the Management Board with a corresponding adjustment 
of the individual objectives. Furthermore, it dealt with the regulatory developments and regulatory findings on compensation 
topics and addressed, also with the support of external advisors, the examination of the existence of the preconditions for the 
suspension, forfeiture or claw-back of elements of variable compensation of (former) members of the Management Board. To 
the extent required, it adopted resolutions and developed recommendations on resolution proposals for the Supervisory Board 
plenum. Another focal point was addressing the Compensation Report on the compensation of the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board, which, pursuant to Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), was to be submitted for 
approval by the General Meeting and subsequently published along with the auditor’s opinion. Furthermore, the Committee 
monitored the identification of Material Risk Takers and the determination of the total amount of variable compensation for the 
2022 financial year as well as the decisions on the compensation for the heads of the Compliance and Risk functions. The 
Compensation Control Committee also addressed the revision of the compensation system for the Management Board, which 
is to be submitted for approval to the General Meeting 2024. The new system is intended to align the basis for the Management 
Board  members’  performance  assessment  more  closely  to  shareholders’  interests.  Starting  2024,  the  long-term  variable 
compensation component will therefore no longer be measured on the basis of the business performance in preceding years, 
but on how financial and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals develop in each following three-year period. 

The Regulatory Oversight Committee met six times in 2023. One meeting was conducted on-site, two meetings were video 
conferences, and three meetings were held as hybrid meetings. The Regulatory Oversight Committee was informed by the 
Management Board on an ongoing basis about contacts with regulators with a significant relevance for the business activity 
and especially about special audits, substantial complaints and other exceptional measures on the part of German and foreign 
bank  regulatory  authorities,  to  the  extent  they  do  not  relate  to  financial  reports  or  audit  matters.  The  Management  Board 
reported in every meeting on the status of the remediation of regulatory enforcement actions and the related critical findings. 
In addition, reports were given to the Committee at its meetings on significant internal investigations and their progress. In 
parallel, the Regulatory Oversight Committee continues to deal with preventive compliance controls and litigation cases with 
the highest risks from the bank’s perspective. 

The  Strategy  and  Sustainability  Committee  met  four  times.  Two  meetings  were  conducted  on-site  and  two  as  video 
conferences. At its meetings, the Committee intensively addressed the bank’s strategic transformation and regularly obtained 
reports  on  this  from  the  Management  Board.  A  special  focus  was  therefore  placed  on  the  bank’s  strategic  and  financial 
planning up to 2025 with the aim of its positioning as “Global Hausbank”. In this context, the Committee addressed the progress 
made in the bank’s key deliverables to achieve operational efficiency increases as well as the portfolio of key business units. 
Another focal point of the Committee’s work was on addressing the bank’s implementation of its sustainability strategy and 
the progress made in achieving its sustainability objectives. Other topics of reporting and discussion were the bank’s digital 
strategy and the range of offers to digitally affine client segments, the strategy of the Technology, Data and Innovation area, 
the  Corporate  Bank  and  Investment  Bank  client  strategies,  regional  strategies,  the  bank’s  operating  model  and 
macroeconomic developments. 

The Technology, Data and Innovation Committee met four times. Two meetings were conducted on-site and two meetings 
were held as video conferences. Focus areas in 2023 were the Group-wide technology strategy, the topic of data management, 
the implementation of key bank-wide technology programs, cyber and information security as well as innovations in the area 
of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Furthermore, in 2023 the Committee extensively addressed the migration of the 
retail banking platform and received updates on the bank’s corresponding program, including details on incident management 
and decommissioning measures. In addition, the Committee received detailed reporting on the IT strategies and roadmaps of 
the  business  divisions  as  well  as  reports  on  the  migration  to  the  cloud,  the  remediation  of  regulatory  findings  and  the 
implementation of the bank’s front-to-back programs. With regard to cyber and information security, the Committee discussed 
the current security situation and the metrics for its assessment, as well as the risks and actions resulting from the geopolitical 
situation in China and Russia. In order to support the Risk Committee with regard to the overall risk strategy, the Technology, 
Data and Innovation Committee addressed risk and control management within the Technology, Data and Innovation area as 
well as the related key deliverables. 

Meetings of the Mediation Committee, established pursuant to the provisions of Germany’s Co-Determination Act (MitbestG), 
were not necessary.

Report of the Supervisory Board 

Corporate Governance 

The  composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board  and  its  committees  is  in  accordance  with  the  legal  requirements  as  well  as 
regulatory governance standards. The European Central Bank reviewed and confirmed the professional qualifications and the 
personal reliability of our members within the framework of its suitability assessment. The suitability assessment covers the 
expertise,  reliability  and  time  available  of  each  individual  member.  In  addition,  there  was  an  assessment  of  the  entire 
Supervisory Board’s knowledge, skills and experience that are necessary for the performance of its tasks (collective suitability). 
The European Central Bank’s Joint Supervisory Team and the Nomination Committee continually monitor the suitability of the 
Supervisory Board members. 

The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the chairpersons of all the committees coordinated their work continually and 
consulted each other regularly and – as required – on an ad hoc basis between the meetings in order to ensure the exchange 
of information necessary to capture and assess all relevant matters and risks in the performance of their tasks. The cooperation 
in the committees was marked by an open and trustful atmosphere. 

The  committee  chairpersons  reported  regularly  at  the  meetings  of  the  Supervisory  Board  on  the  work  of  the  individual 
committees.  Regularly  before  the  meetings  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  the  representatives  of  the  employees  and  the 
representatives of the shareholders conducted preliminary discussions separately. At the beginning or end of the meetings of 
the Supervisory Board and its committees, discussions were regularly held in “Executive Sessions” without the participation 
of the Management Board.  

The  Chairman  of  the  Supervisory  Board  and  the  chairpersons  of  the  committees  engaged  regularly  in  discussions  with 
representatives of various regulators and informed them about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees and 
about the cooperation with the Management Board. 

Together  with  the  bank’s  Investor  Relations  Department,  the  Supervisory  Board  Chairman  conducted  discussions  with 
investors,  proxy  advisors  and  shareholders’  associations.  The  subjects  of  the  discussions  were  governance  and  strategy 
topics from the Supervisory Board’s perspective, questions related to appointments of personnel and succession planning, 
the  bank’s  control  processes,  Management  Board  compensation,  and  the  Supervisory  Board’s  view  of  the  bank’s 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy.  

At several meetings of the Nomination Committee and of the Supervisory Board in plenum, we addressed the assessment 
prescribed by law of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board for the 2023 financial year, which also comprises the 
self-assessment according to the German Corporate Governance Code. The final discussion of the results took place at a 
meeting of the Supervisory Board plenum on January 31, 2024, and the results were set out in a final report.  

For  further  information,  for  example,  on  the  Audit  Committee  financial  experts,  the  compensation  experts  and  the 
independence of the individual members, we refer to the “Supervisory Board” section in the Corporate Governance Statement. 

The Declaration of Conformity pursuant to Section 161 of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which we had last issued with the 
Management Board in October 2022, was reissued in October 2023. The text of the Declaration of Conformity, along with a 
comprehensive presentation of the bank’s corporate governance, can be found in the Annual Report and on the bank’s website 
at https://www.db.com/ir/en/ documents.htm. Our Declarations of Conformity and Corporate Governance Statements from the 
past  five  years  are also  available  there,  in  addition  to  the  currently  applicable  versions  of  the  Terms of  Reference for the 
Supervisory Board and its committees as well as for the Management Board. 

Training and further education measures 

We held several training sessions in 2023, as in prior years. They were conducted in most cases by external subject matter 
experts, but also by internal experts. The training focused on topics such as artificial intelligence, climate and environmental 
risks as well as macroeconomic developments and their effects on the bank. Furthermore, we received an outlook for the 
global and regulatory environment in the financial services sector for the year 2023 (including topic areas such as geopolitics 
and regulatory fragmentation, economic conditions and impacts on clients, digital assets, the digitalization of financial services, 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues, combating financial crime, strategic agility and operational resilience, 
and regulatory requirements). 

For  the  new  members  that  joined  the  Supervisory  Board,  extensive  induction  courses  tailored  to  them  individually  were 
developed and carried out to facilitate their induction into office.

Conflicts of interest and their handling 

We continually strive to identify and prevent potential conflicts of interest on the part of our members as early as possible and 
arrange for their mitigation.  

Following  the  election  of  the  employee  representatives  to  the  Supervisory  Board  on  April  5,  2023,  Ms.  Gerlinde  Siebert 
informed  us  that her  role  as  Global  Head  of  Governance  may  overlap  with  tasks  of  the  Regulatory Oversight  Committee. 
Through in-depth discussions, the Supervisory Board was able to ensure itself that any resulting conflict of interest does not 
stand in the way of an unrestricted participation on the Supervisory Board. Ms. Gerlinde Siebert did not become a member of 
the Regulatory Oversight Committee, so no potential conflict of interest exists. 

Also, the performance of external mandates by our Supervisory Board members at other companies and management bodies 
is regularly reviewed for potential conflicts of interest. 

Annual Financial Statements, Consolidated Financial Statements, and the combined separate 
Non-Financial Report and Compensation Report 

EY GmbH & Co. KG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (EY) audited the Annual Financial Statements, including the accounting 
and the Combined Management Report for the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 
2023 financial year and issued  in each case an unqualified audit opinion on March 11, 2024. The Auditor’s Reports were 
signed jointly by the Auditors Mr. Mai and Mr. Lösken.  

Furthermore, EY performed a limited assurance review in the context of the combined separate Non-Financial Report as well 
as  the  Non-Financial  Statement  (Non-Financial  Reporting)  and  in  each  case  issued  an  unqualified  opinion.  EY  issued  a 
separate unqualified opinion for the Compensation Report. 

The Audit Committee examined the documents for the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements 
2023 as well as the Non-Financial Reporting 2023 at its meeting on March 12, 2024. Representatives of EY provided the final 
report on the audit results. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported to us on this at the meeting of the Supervisory 
Board.  Based  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Audit  Committee,  and  after  inspecting  the  Annual  Financial  Statements  and 
Consolidated Financial Statements documents as well as the documents for the Non-Financial Reporting and following an 
extensive discussion on the Supervisory Board as well as with the representatives of the auditor, we noted the results of the 
audits with approval. We determined that, also based on the final results of our inspections, there are no objections to be 
raised. 

Today, we approved the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements prepared by the Management 
Board. The Annual Financial Statements are thus established. We agree to the proposal for the appropriation of distributable 
profit. 

Personnel issues 

The term of office of Ms. Mayree Clark, Mr. John Thain, Ms. Michele Trogni and Professor Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann ended 
as scheduled with the conclusion of the General Meeting on May 17, 2023. In accordance with our proposal, the General 
Meeting re-elected all four of these shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board, in each case for a term of office of 
around four years. 

With  the  conclusion  of  the  General  Meeting  on  May  17,  2023,  the  term  of  office  of  the  employee  representatives  on  the 
Supervisory  Board  came  to  an  end.  Mr.  Jan  Duscheck,  Ms.  Manja  Eifert  and  Mr.  Timo  Heider  were  re-elected  to  the 
Supervisory  Board.  Newly  elected  as  employee  representatives  to  the  Supervisory  Board  were  Ms.  Susanne  Bleidt,  Ms. 
Claudia Fieber, Ms. Birgit Laumen, Ms. Gerlinde Siebert, Mr. Frank Schulze, Mr. Stephan Szukalski (elected for the third time 
to the Supervisory Board) and Mr. Jürgen Tögel. 

Ms. Birgit Laumen stepped down from her office with effect from January 12, 2024. Mr. Florian Haggenmiller was appointed 
by the court as her successor with effect from January 16, 2024.

Report of the Supervisory Board 

Mr. Karl von Rohr’s term of office as Management Board member ended on October 31, 2023. Mr. Karl von Rohr had informed 
us that he would not be seeking to renew his Management Board Service Contract beyond the intended expiry on October 
31, 2023. Ms. Christiana Riley decided to take up a challenge outside of the bank and stepped down from her Management 
Board mandate with effect from May 17, 2023, and left the bank with effect from May 31, 2023. We appointed Mr. Claudio de 
Sanctis  with  effect  from  July  1,  2023,  to  the  Management  Board  as  Mr.  Karl  von  Rohr’s  successor,  to  ensure  an  orderly 
transition in the position. On October 25, 2023, we resolved to extend Ms. Rebecca Short’s Management Board appointment 
by three years to April 30, 2027. 

All resolutions were based on the recommendations of the Nomination Committee and the Chairman’s Committee. 

We sincerely thank the members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board as well as the members who left last 
year for their dedicated work and their constructive assistance to the company during the past years. 

Furthermore, we would also like to express our deep appreciation and thanks to the bank’s employees for their great personal 
dedication.

Strategy 

Strategy 

Global Hausbank 

Deutsche Bank’s strategic and financial roadmap through 2025 aims to position Deutsche Bank as a Global Hausbank, and 
to achieve the bank’s 2025 financial targets and capital objectives. The Global Hausbank strategy is underpinned by three key 
themes: risk management, sustainability and technology, which have become even more important considering the ongoing 
geopolitical and macro-economic challenges. In this environment, Deutsche Bank aims to leverage a more favorable interest 
rate environment, deploy risk management expertise to support clients, and allocate capital to high-return growth opportunities. 
As sustainability becomes ever more important, the bank aims to deepen its dialogue with and support for clients and broaden 
the agenda in respect of the bank’s own operations. As technology continues to evolve, Deutsche Bank aims to achieve further 
cost savings, accelerate the transition to a digital bank and expand upon strategic partnerships, which are already creating 
substantial value. At the same time, Deutsche Bank continues to work towards a long-term set-up that will enable a future of 
sustainable growth. This includes a clear definition of its purpose, vision and culture. 

Deutsche Bank’s key performance indicators 2025 

Financial targets and capital objectives for 2025 

Financial targets: 

– Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity of above 10% for the Group
– Compound annual growth rate of revenues between 2021 and 2025 of 5.5 to 6.5% (raised from 3.5 to 4.5%)
– Cost/income ratio of less than 62.5%

Capital objectives: 

– Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of approximately 13%
– 50% Total payout ratio from 2025

Deutsche Bank reaffirms its financial targets, including the compound annual growth rate of revenues target which it has raised 
from 3.5–4.5% to 5.5–6.5% at the beginning of 2024, as well as its capital objectives for 2025. 

Post-tax  Return  on  Average  Tangible  Equity  and  adjusted  costs  are  non-GAAP  financial  measures.  Please  refer  to 
“Supplementary  financial  information  (Unaudited):  Non-GAAP  financial  measures”  of  this  report  for  the  definitions  of  such 
measures and reconciliations to the IFRS numbers on which they are based. 

Progress on strategy implementation 

In 2023, Deutsche Bank made further progress in accelerating the execution of its Global Hausbank strategy on all dimensions: 
revenue growth, operational and capital efficiency. 

Revenues grew to around € 29 billion, and the revenue growth rate was close to 7% per year since 2021 as benefits of the 
sharpened  business  model  came  through.  The  bank  made  conscious  investment  decisions  in  2023  to  further  develop  its 
franchise, mainly to drive business growth, strengthen controls and improve operational efficiency. Deutsche Bank believes 
that the bank has reached an inflection point on costs with these investments approaching completion. Furthermore, the bank 
demonstrated resilience, with high-quality risk management and a strong capital and balance sheet, resulting in both dividends 
and share buybacks increased by 50% compared to 2022.  

XXI 

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Strategy 

Revenue growth 

On revenue growth, Deutsche Bank believes that the bank delivered sustained growth from a well-balanced business mix. For 
example, the bank took advantage of rising interest rates, notably in the Corporate Bank and Private Bank, but also focused 
on increasing the bank’s fee income across all fee-generating businesses. Corporate Bank developed innovative products, 
hired relationship managers in strategic areas, and deepened relationships with key clients. Investment Bank continued to 
execute against its strategic priorities, including completing the acquisition of Numis to enhance its ability to deliver its service 
offering  to  its  clients.  Furthermore,  Investment  Bank  and  International  Private  Bank  added  senior  bankers  in  client-facing 
areas. The bank also attracted net inflows of € 57 billion across the Private Bank and Asset Management, which has helped 
grow Assets under Management by € 115 billion to € 1.5 trillion across these businesses. 

Given the progress achieved, Deutsche Bank raised its compound annual growth target for the period between 2021 and 2025 
from 3.5 - 4.5% to 5.5 - 6.5% at the beginning of 2024, after outperforming the bank’s original target in both 2022 and 2023. 
The bank’s expectation is that the achievement of the revised target will be supported by growth of noninterest income from a 
growing market share in Corporate Bank, reaping the benefits of investments in Origination & Advisory, building on the bank’s 
recent strong relative performance in the Fixed Income and Currencies (FIC) business, growing fees from investment products 
in Private Bank and expanding certain lending businesses. In Asset Management, the bank plans to take full advantage of the 
market recovery that started at the end of 2023 to grow further in Passive and Alternatives. Additionally, Private Bank and 
Asset Management aim to convert 2023’s net inflows and growth in assets under management into revenues. 

Operational efficiency 

Deutsche  Bank  made further  progress  on  its  € 2.5 billion  operational  efficiency  program during  2023  and  already  realized 
savings  from  completed  efficiency  measures.  The  bank  expects  the  remaining  savings  to  result  from  the  execution  of 
measures relating to infrastructure and technology efficiencies, including application decommissioning and operating model 
improvements,  optimization  of  the  bank’s  platform  in  Germany  and  front-to-back  process  redesign,  including  simplified 
workflows and automation. These measures are also expected to lead to a reduction of approximately 3,500 roles, mainly in 
non-client-facing areas, of which some have already left the platform. The bank aims for a quarterly run-rate of adjusted costs 
of € 5 billion in 2024 and aims to operate with total noninterest expenses of around € 20 billion in 2025. 

Deutsche Bank’s 2023 cost base was impacted by inflation, business growth and investments to accelerate execution of the 
bank’s Global Hausbank strategy. Some of the investments to accelerate strategy execution are non-recurring and mainly 
related  to  improvements  of  the  bank’s  operational  efficiency  as  outlined  above  and  real  estate  one-offs.  The  bank  also 
recognized  an  impairment  of  goodwill  related  to  Numis  in  2023.  In  addition,  Deutsche  Bank  made  investments  that  are 
expected to continue to impact the bank’s cost base. On business growth, the bank has invested in businesses which are less 
capital intensive and on controls, it further strengthened key functions. 

Investment  in  innovation  and  digitalization  remains  a  key  focus  area  of  Deutsche  Bank’s  operational  efficiency  targets.  In 
2023, the bank has broadened its technological reach with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) including with the testing  of 
Google Cloud's AI tools. Opportunities from AI are expected in operations and process automation to enable investments in 
client solutions and fuel revenue growth.

Strategy 

Capital efficiency 

With respect to capital efficiency, Deutsche Bank reduced risk-weighted assets (RWA) in 2023, already putting the bank on 
track regarding its ambition for RWA reductions of € 25 to 30 billion by 2025. These measures, together with strong organic 
capital generation, enabled Deutsche Bank to increase its CET1 ratio to 13.7% as of year end 2023, up from 13.4% at year 
end 2022. Deutsche Bank aims to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of around 13%, i.e., to operate with a buffer 
of 200 basis points above the bank’s expected maximum distributable amount (MDA) threshold, also after the impacts from 
the adoption of CRR 3, which is expected to become effective on January 1, 2025. 

Deutsche  Bank  plans  to  sustainably  grow  cash  dividends  and,  over  time,  return  to  shareholders  through  share  buybacks 
excess  capital  over  and  above  the  requirements  to  support  profitable  growth  and  upcoming  regulatory  changes.  For  the 
financial year 2023, the Management Board intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of € 0.45 per share, 
after having  paid  a  dividend  of  € 0.30  per share for 2022  and  € 0.20  per share for 2021.  For  the  financial  year 2024  and 
subsequent years, the bank targets a payout ratio of 50% of net income attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders, delivered 
through a combination of cash dividends and share buybacks. These distributions to shareholders are subject to shareholder 
authorization and German corporate law requirements, and in the case of share buybacks additionally require prior regulatory 
approval. Deutsche Bank plans to increase both share repurchases and dividends by at least 50% year on year in 2024. The 
bank has received supervisory approval for a share repurchase of € 675 million, which it aims materially to complete in the 
first  half  of  2024,  having  completed  € 450 million  in  share  repurchases  in  2023;  and  Deutsche  Bank  plans  to  propose  a 
dividend in respect of the 2023 financial year of € 0.45 per share, or approximately € 900 million, up from € 0.30 per share for 
2022, at the bank’s Annual General Meeting in May 2024. For the financial years 2024 and 2025, Deutsche Bank aims for 
cash dividends of € 0.68 and € 1.00 per share, respectively, subject to a 50% payout ratio limitation relative to net income 
attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders. The bank has set a capital distribution goal of € 8 billion in respect of the financial 
years 2021-2025, paid in 2022-2026, and believes that it is positioned to exceed this objective based on the achievement of 
the bank’s financial targets.  

The  rating  agencies  recognized  the  continued  progress  the  bank  has  made  over  the  course  of  2023,  specifically  further 
improvements in profitability. This was reflected in upgrades by S&P, Fitch and Morningstar DBRS during the year. In May, 
S&P raised its outlook on the bank to positive. DBRS Morningstar upgraded all Deutsche Bank’s long-term ratings by one

Bank’s credit ratings, the fourth successive upgrade of Deutsche Bank’s credit ratings by a leading rating agency during 2023. 
S&P  highlighted  the  bank’s  progress  in  growing  the  franchise,  strengthening  earnings,  and  maintaining  solid  capital  and

Strategy 

Sustainability 

Deutsche  Bank  has  the  strong  intention  to  support  and  accelerate  the  historic  transformation  towards a  more  sustainable 
society  and  economy.  Consequently,  Deutsche  Bank’s  Management  Board  made  sustainability  a  management  priority  in 
2019. 

To  underpin  this,  the  bank  hosted  its  2nd  Sustainability  Deep  Dive  in  March  2023,  where  senior  leaders  reported  on  the 
progress in implementing the bank’s sustainability strategy in the specific business and infrastructure areas. The focus was 
on how the bank plans to embed environmental, social and governance aspects into products, policies, and processes. The 
sustainability strategy focuses on the following four pillars:  

–  Sustainable finance: navigating the bank’s clients on their sustainability journey by being deeply embedded in their decision 

making and processes, supported by an innovative and data-driven offering 

–  Policies and  commitments:  maintaining  and  developing  dedicated  control  frameworks and  processes  to  turn regulatory 

challenges into business opportunities and steer decision-making based on impact measurement 

–  People  and  own  operations:  building  a  sustainability-led  organization  driven  by  value-based  leadership,  empowered 

employees – embedding environmental and social aspects deeply in the bank’s processes 

–  Thought leadership and stakeholder engagement: playing a pivotal role for government agencies, academia and interest 

groups to accelerate standard setting locally and internationally  

By  implementing  this  strategy, the  bank  aims to  maximize  its contribution  to  the  Paris Climate  Agreement  and  the  United 
Nations’  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  Deutsche  Bank  has  endorsed  multiple  universal  sustainability  frameworks  and 
initiatives,  such  as  the  UN’s  Environment  Programme  Finance  Initiative,  the  UN  Global  Compact,  and  the  Principles  for 
Responsible Banking. 

To measure and report transparently about the progress, Deutsche Bank has set the following targets and goals: 

–  The bank wants to achieve cumulative sustainable financing and ESG investment volumes of € 500 billion in the period 
from January 2020 to end of 2025 (excluding DWS); which transactions can be classified as sustainable is documented in 
Deutsche Bank’s Sustainable Finance Framework and published on Deutsche Bank’s website 

–  It  wants  to  achieve  the  bank’s  net-zero  commitment  by  2050  and  has,  therefore,  published  net-zero  targets  for  seven 

carbon-intensive sectors in the bank’s corporate loan book by end of 2030 (interim) and end of 2050 (final) 

–  The bank plans to ensure that at least 35% of Managing Director, Director and Vice President roles are held by women by 

2025 

–  It wants to reduce emissions in the bank’s own operations and supply chain (Scope 1, Scope 2 and disclosed Scope 3: 

Category 1 to 14) by 46% by the end of 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline 

In 2023, Deutsche Bank continued to deliver on the targets, goals and pillars of the bank’s sustainability strategy. For example, 
the bank:  

–  Published its initial Transition Plan summarizing the bank’s decarbonization strategy and actions along three dimensions: 
own operations (Scope 1 and 2), supply chain (disclosed Scope 3: Category 1 to 14); and the financing the bank provides 
to its clients (Scope 3: Category 15) 

–  Announced three additional sectoral emission reduction targets in the corporate loan portfolio for Shipping, Cement and 
Coal Mining after having published pathway targets for four sectors in the previous year (i.e., Oil & Gas, Automotive, Power 
Generation and Steel) 

–  Updated the bank’s thermal coal guideline by tightening the criteria on when a company is deemed a thermal coal company 
and  in  scope  of  the  guideline,  as  well  as  specifying  the  requirements  to  be  applied  to  clients  in  scope  of  the  updated 
guideline 

–  Rolled out a “Sustainable Finance” training for client facing staff, and funded community conservation projects in several 

Asia-Pacific countries by partnering with The Nature Conservancy 

–  Further enhanced the bank’s risk management and related processes to prevent human rights violations in the supply chain 

in accordance with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act 

To  reinforce  Deutsche  Bank’s  sustainability  strategy,  the  transformation  of  the  bank  with  regards  to  sustainability-related 
targets and goals is a component for the bank's top executives' performance-based compensation.

Deutsche Bank Business segments 

Corporate Bank 

Corporate banking is an integral part of Deutsche Bank’s business. Corporate Bank’s capabilities in Cash Management, Trade 
Finance and Lending in close collaboration with Foreign Exchange in the Investment Bank enable the division to serve the 
core needs of corporate clients. As a leading bank serving multinational and German corporates domestically and abroad, the 
Corporate Bank helps clients in optimizing their working capital and liquidity, securing global supply chains and distribution 
channels and managing their risks (source: EUROMONEY). Furthermore, Corporate Bank acts as a specialized provider of 
services to financial institutions, offering Correspondent Banking, Trust and Agency Services as well as Securities Services. 
Finally, the division provides Business Banking services to small corporate and entrepreneur clients in Germany through a 
standardized product suite. 

Corporate Bank has defined a number of specific initiatives to capitalize on its core competencies across these different areas 
to grow revenues to achieve its targets. In particular, the division’s investments in new initiatives and experience in managing 
complex situations for clients, such as uncertainties associated with increasing geopolitical tensions, lower economic growth 
in  the  major  operating  countries  from  ongoing  supply  chain  disruptions,  higher  energy  and  commodity  prices  as  well  as 
uncertainty around central bank policies, allow Corporate Bank to prove its advisory and solution capabilities. 

In 2023, Corporate Bank continued to make progress on the business segment’s strategic objectives, benefiting from rising 
interest rates and a strong pricing discipline. In July 2023, Deutsche Bank was selected as the new issuing partner for the 
Lufthansa Miles & More Credit Card, Europe’s leading loyalty program, from mid-2025. In addition, the segment intends to 
further expand its digital offerings, for example Corporate Bank applied to the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority 
(BaFin) in the second quarter of 2023 to obtain a license for the custody of digital assets. 

Looking  ahead,  Corporate  Bank  is  expected  to  continue  to  act  as  an  integral  part  of  the  Global  Hausbank  strategy  and 
contribute  to  Deutsche  Bank’s  2025  objectives.  The  segment  sees  growth  opportunities  across  all  core  client  groups 
Corporate,  Institutional,  Business  Banking,  both  from  existing  Corporate  Bank  strengths  and  from  new  products.  The 
segment's global network across 140 countries combined with profound local knowledge, a comprehensive product suite and 
tailored client offering, should continue to offer competitive advantages versus the division’s peers. Corporate Bank continues 
working towards its strategic ambitions, leveraging its strong brand and deep client relationships and aiming to offer a full 
range of advisory and financing solutions for corporate treasurers. The segment wants to remain the trusted partner for the 
German economy and build on its standing as the leading Corporate Bank in its home market. The segment is also committed 
to  connect  financial  institutions  worldwide,  a  business  where  it  is  one  of  the  market  leaders  (source:  SWIFT  Euro  peer 
benchmarking). 

Corporate  Bank’s  initiatives  will  target  revenue  growth  with  corporate  clients  across  cash  management  and  payments, 
including growing its fee-based business with institutional clients and expanding lending. 

As the segment seeks to grow its business with clients globally, Corporate Bank commits to apply sound risk management 
principles to maintain its high-quality loan portfolio and strict lending standards. Equally, the segment sees further potential to 
reduce its cost base from technology and front-to-back process optimization as well as automation and location strategy. 

Moreover, as a transition partner, Corporate Bank helps its clients across sector value chains to achieve their strategic goals 
by offering a broad suite of sustainable finance solutions and sector aligned ESG industry expertise. Also, Corporate Bank 
aims to enable the accelerated renewables and infrastructure build-out through asset and project finance capabilities including 
new technologies like storage solutions, hydrogen and carbon management.

Annual Report 2023 

Strategy 

Investment Bank 

The Investment Bank is a key pillar of Deutsche Bank’s business. Across FIC and Origination and Advisory, corporate and 
institutional clients access a comprehensive range of services, encompassing, financing, market making/liquidity provision, 
risk management solutions, advisory, and debt and equity issuance. The segment regionally encompasses EMEA, Americas 
and APAC across both Investment Bank businesses and client footprint. 

In  2023,  underlying  markets  were  less  conducive  to  client  flows  versus  a  very  strong  2022  and  the  resulting  uncertainty 
continued to depress levels of capital market and advisory activity. Despite this, the Investment Bank continued to execute 
against its strategic priorities, delivering an enhanced service offering to its clients and building on the progress made since 
the formation of the business in 2019. 

The development of the Investment Bank’s FIC business has been pronounced, with the long-term growth in revenue and 
market share reflecting the successful delivery against strategic objectives across multiple areas of the business. This success 
has been driven by a wide range of factors. A strong and stable management team is in place, with the segment demonstrating 
its ability to attract leading talent via a number of specific and targeted senior hires into sub-business leadership positions 
through 2023. A defined technology strategy is delivering simplified and sustainable capability – with over 175 applications 
decommissioned in the past two years – and investment into areas across the business is enabling product enhancements 
and the development of new capability for the division’s clients. This has been demonstrated by workflow solutions, which 
provide clients access to Deutsche Bank’s product suite in a simplified and operationally efficient manner. The continued focus 
on the division’s clients has been enhanced via the creation of dedicated relationship management and client enablement 
functions within the Institutional Coverage Group. This ensures deeper strategic relationships with clients, whilst providing 
them with the most efficient ways of working with Deutsche Bank. This is further enhanced by the significant increase in client 
engagement  following  the  recent  rating  upgrades.  The  continued  success  has  also  been  recognized  externally.  As  an 
example, Euromoney recognized Deutsche Bank as the leading global FX provider for a second year in a row. 

In  an  environment  where  fee  pools  continued  to  be  restricted,  the  focus  of  Origination  &  Advisory  has  been  building  the 
platform to ensure the business is positioned to benefit when activity is expected to return in 2024. A significant number of 
targeted senior hires have been made, with a focus upon sectors and regions where Deutsche Bank is able to compete but is 
currently underweight. Alongside this organic growth, the acquisition of Numis will further enhance Origination & Advisory’s 
depth of offering in the UK, the largest EMEA fee pool, whilst also enabling the cross-sell of other segmental products into the 
client base. To ensure that strong relationships are maintained with clients, the business has established a Client Strategy 
and Analytics team which will drive the depth of relationships with its client base and ensure close monitoring of performance 
at the most granular level. 

In 2024, the strategy of the Investment Bank is focused on working towards its vision of being the leading non-U.S. global 
investment  bank  and  delivering  upon  the  segment’s  growth  and  return  targets.  This  is  aimed  to  be  achieved  via  targeted 
growth investments and the continued development of its client strategy, combined with a focus on technology, data enabled 
capability, capital efficiency and control. 

The investments made into the Origination & Advisory franchise are expected to increase the weighting of strategic advisory 
revenues as a percentage of total revenues over time. Within FIC, investment into existing businesses in areas where the 
division  has  a  competitive  advantage  will  continue.  This  will  be  complemented  by  the  expansion  into  a  small  number  of 
adjacent businesses where the existing platform and client base can be leveraged to enable growth at low marginal costs. 
The result of each of these will be a further diversification of revenue streams, whilst also ensuring an enhanced and relevant 
product offering for the client base. 

Finally, ESG remains a priority across the Investment Bank as the segment continues supporting its clients globally. Deutsche 
Bank held its second Sustainability Deep Dive in March 2023, providing insight into the different approaches that the bank has 
developed with clients across the globe. From a transaction perspective there were a number of key events in 2023 including 
completing a bespoke deal-contingent interest rate hedge and a tailored financing for Hai Long, Taiwan’s largest offshore wind 
project  to  date,  and  acting  as  global  coordinator  and  joint  active  bookrunner  on  Air  France-KLM’s  € 1 billion  inaugural 
sustainability-linked long 3-year and long 5-year bond offering.

Strategy 

Private Bank 

Private Bank is structured along two core businesses: Private Bank Germany and International Private Bank. Private Bank 
serves  personal  and  private  clients,  wealthy  individuals,  entrepreneurs  and  families.  Within  the  segment,  the  international 
businesses  also  focus  on  commercial  clients.  With  over  20 million  clients  and  a  broad  range  of  financial  services  in 
19 countries, Private Bank significantly contributes to Deutsche Bank’s global businesses. The segment continued to drive a 
disciplined  approach  towards  achieving  its  strategic  and  financial  objectives.  The  achievements  throughout  2023  enabled 
Private Bank to further close the gap towards its 2025 targets. Private Bank’s progress in evolving its businesses was also in 
line with the Group’s ambition across growth, operational and capital efficiency. 

Private Bank Germany is positioned as the market leading private bank in Germany and serves 19 million customers with its 
two  major  brands  Deutsche  Bank  and  Postbank.  While  Deutsche  Bank  continues  to  offer  private  customers  high-quality 
advisory services with outstanding individual product solutions, the customers of the Postbank brand benefit from non-complex 
and standardized product offerings alongside postal and parcel services in cooperation with Deutsche Post DHL. Across its 
omni-channel offerings, Private Bank customers not only have access to a nationwide branch network but also to diverse 
banking solutions via direct sales, mobile sales and distribution partners. 

In 2023, Private Bank Germany increased its revenues materially versus the prior year, supported by robust growth in deposits 
and successful campaigns for fixed rate products. While mortgage lending business remained at a stable level, Private Bank 
Germany’s assets under management in the investment business increased compared to the prior year, driven by high inflows 
as  a  result  of  the  positive  market  development.  Furthermore,  Private  Bank  Germany  continued  to  work  on  its  strategic 
transformation. This included the continued transformation of the sub-division’s go-to-market model including the reduction of 
Postbank branches to approximately 550 at year end 2023 and the implementation of new branch concepts. In the upcoming 
years, Private Bank Germany plans to further adjust its go-to-market model and strengthen its digital proposition. Additionally, 
Private  Bank  Germany  completed  one  of  the  largest  customer  migrations  in  the  European  banking  market  in  2023. 
Twelve million customers with 19 million contracts were migrated to a unified platform for all customers in Germany paving 
the way for decommissioning all former Postbank Group legacy applications and enabling the bank to further drive its digital 
transformation. The  migration  resulted  in  a  higher  number of  client  requests  leading  to  a  backlog  of  unresolved  requests. 
Private Bank Germany is prioritizing a remediation plan to improve capacities, address client concerns and to return to the 
target operational service levels. 

International  Private  Bank  has  a  well-diversified  revenue  mix  across  regions  with  client  segments  focused  on  Wealth 
Management, Bank for Entrepreneurs and Premium Banking. The business targets ultra-high net worth family entrepreneurs 
globally and affluent clients across Europe focused on a digitally led model, with a larger ambition to be the global house of 
choice for entrepreneurs. 

International Private Bank maintained its strong momentum in attracting client inflows with positive net inflows in assets under 
management in each quarter for four consecutive years despite difficult market conditions in 2023. International Private Bank’s 
flagship  strategic  asset  allocation  and  innovative  private  market/ultra-high  net  worth  focused  solutions  have  significantly 
contributed towards the International Private Bank’s net new assets growth. Furthermore, the business continued its progress 
on  several  targeted  initiatives  to  fulfil  its  strategic  agenda,  e.g.,  strengthening  wealth  management  coverage  and  product 
teams in key markets supported by entrepreneur-focused strategic hires. The business has also applied strict cost discipline, 
thereby successfully managing costs in an inflationary environment. The benefits of both OneBank and Bank for Entrepreneurs 
approaches  were  reflected  in  the  business  successfully  addressing  the  complex  needs  of  wealthy  entrepreneur  clients. 
Furthermore,  in  Premium  Banking,  the  business  continued  its  strategic  transformation  journey  toward  digital-first  remote 
advisory and client engagement services, while optimizing and innovating the branch footprint. 

In ESG, Private Bank announced its strategy for the upcoming years at Deutsche Bank’s Sustainability Deep Dive in March 
2023,  further  substantiating  its  overall  ESG  value  proposition  through  product  portfolio  enhancements,  strategic  thematic 
collaborations and focused inhouse ESG enablement efforts. This was aimed at supporting clients in their overall sustainable 
transition journeys. 

In July 2023, Private Bank announced a new organizational set-up to further enhance the segment’s capabilities and to achieve 
its 2025 targets. Commencing from the first quarter of 2024, the Private Bank will follow a customer-focused approach with 
two client sub-segments: ‘Wealth Management & Private Banking’ and ‘Personal Banking’. Wealth Management & Private 
Banking will combine Private Banking, high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients globally. ‘Personal Banking’ includes all 
retail and affluent customers as well as commercial banking clients across specific international regions. These commercial 
banking  clients  consist  of  small  business  clients  and  small-sized  corporate  clients  that  are  not  covered  by  the  Wealth 
Management & Private Banking sub-segment.

Strategy 

Asset Management 

Asset  Management  principally  consists  of  DWS  Group  GmbH  &  Co.,  a  global  asset  manager  with  diverse  investment 
capabilities that spans traditional active and passive strategies, as well as alternative bespoke solutions. 

DWS operates in an ever-changing market environment and faces a variety of economical, fiscal, political and environmental 
challenges.  DWS  strategy  consists  of  the  four strategic  clusters;  Growth,  Value,  Build  and Reduce, and  are aligned  to  its 
capabilities and the growth prospects of the market. The aim is to maintain market leadership in Germany, building on expertise 
and customer relationships, in addition to expanding existing partnerships and developing new distribution channels, to gain 
additional  market  share.  DWS  sees  additional  market  potential  especially  in  Alternatives  investments  and  Passive  funds, 
represented by the Xtrackers brand. The overall strategy also takes account of sustainability and in 2023, DWS updated its 
sustainability strategy to clearly define its priorities. 

The Growth strategy is built on the strength in Passive and Alternatives businesses. The Passive business, with the Xtrackers 
brand, in the division’s view offers sustained and profitable growth potential, which provides sufficient scalability. Building on 
the franchise and European business, DWS has decided to invest in a US growth plan including sustainability, thematic and 
Active ETFs. Further, DWS sees a strong demand for mandates in Asia Pacific, and therefore plans to expand its customized 
mandates business. In addition to regional growth potential, DWS continues to see opportunities for bespoke Passive solutions 
to outperform broad index replication. 

In Alternatives, investor interest in real estate slowed down in 2023, while demand in the infrastructure sector remained strong. 
However,  DWS  expects an  increase  in  demand  within  Alternatives,  and  aims  to  facilitate  closing  the  gap  between  capital 
demand  and  supply  with  private  capital  investment  solutions  in  Europe.  DWS  continues  to  focus  on  its  real  estate  and 
infrastructure investment platforms and positioning the division for growth in the private debt space. 

The Value strategy aims to maintain leadership in mature markets for Active investment strategies, specifically Equity, Fixed 
Income and Multi Asset. In Equity, DWS intends to further grow the platform for Thematic Equities and make progress on 
offerings towards sustainability. Given the changing market environment and higher interest rates, DWS will further focus on 
Fixed Income and institutional investors. In Multi-Asset, the aim is to further strengthen solutions capabilities and enhance the 
modular investment platform to achieve more scale. 

The Build strategy’s emphasis on digitization trends aims to focus on asset management as-a-service and digital assets. DWS 
plans  to  build  a  respective  modular  offering  which  is  scalable  and  integrated  via  application  programming  interfaces  into 
offerings  of  new  and  existing  distribution  partners.  DWS  expects  increasing  tokenization  of  the  economy,  with  resulting 
changes in market structure, and aims to utilize new blockchain infrastructure, develop new products and reach digital native 
clients. In December 2023, DWS agreed to establish a joint venture with Galaxy Digital and Flow Traders, to bring together 
traditional  asset  management  expertise  with  digital  asset  know-how,  with  the  aim  of  issuing  a  fully  collateralized  euro-
denominated stablecoin in a regulated environment. 

The Reduce strategy intends to reallocate financial resources to fund investments in the Build and Growth areas. DWS will 
continuously  analyze  measures  to  increase  efficiency,  including  divesting  from  sub-scale  businesses  and  reduction  of 
management layers, thereby ensuring these measures do not have a negative impact on the ongoing business. In 2023, DWS 
completed the sale of its Private Equity solutions business unit. Additionally, DWS reduced management levels within the 
business as part of a broader efficiency program. 

Based on its strategy, DWS remains committed to deliver on its medium-term financial targets until 2025 of; earnings per 
share  target  of  € 4.50  in  2025,  adjusted  cost/income  ratio  of  below  59%  by  2025  and  AuM  growth  in  Passive,  including 
Xtrackers, and Alternatives of 12% and 10% respectively (compound annual growth rate 2022-2025). 

In 2023, DWS updated its sustainability strategy and refined its sustainability priorities. The ambition is to enable clients to 
navigate the sustainable transformation of the real economy by providing them with investment expertise and solutions. The 
topic of climate change remains the core theme of the updated sustainability strategy, built around three priorities: focus on 
climate related investing, strengthen engagement with investees and other relevant stakeholders, and advance DWS’ own 
corporate transformation to achieve commitment to net zero.

contracted until spring and then flattened out, leading to a moderate shrinkage for 
the full year. It is only the second time this has happened since records began in

In 2023, Commercial Real Estate (CRE) markets continued to face headwinds due to the impacts of higher interest rates, 
decreasing market liquidity combined with tightened lending conditions, and structural changes in the office sector. The market 
stress has been more pronounced in the U.S., where property price indices point to a greater decline of CRE asset values 
from recent peaks compared to Europe and APAC. Especially within the office segment, the market weakness is most evident 
in the U.S., reflected in subdued leasing activity and higher vacancy rates compared to Europe.  

The global Origination & Advisory industry fee pool in 2023 fell a further 16%, following a 35% drop in 2022 from record highs 
in 2021, driven by a subdued Mergers & Acquisitions market, challenging primary credit markets, and largely inactive sponsors. 
Mergers & Acquisitions in 2023 fell 23% but was still higher than the pre-COVID-19 pandemic fee pool of € 26 billion, while 
the fourth quarter 2023 had strong volumes. Equity Capital Markets issuance increased in 2023 as equity markets bounced 
back and volatility was low. The high yield market was up over 60% from a decade-long low, while leveraged loan issuance 
fell  17%  with  sponsors  choosing  to  continue  their  pause  on  acquisitions.  The  investment  grade  bond  market  remained 
relatively robust with issuance down 3% in 2023 and has had a strong start to 2024. Within Fixed Income, revenue pools 
remained  at  elevated  levels  compared  to  historical  averages,  although  below  the  levels  seen  in  2022.  Foreign  exchange 
activity  decreased  across  the  ten  most  traded  currencies  globally,  with  Rates  and  Emerging  Markets  each  declining  from 
strong levels in the prior year. Conversely within Credit, an increase year on year was driven by a more favorable environment 
for secondary  trading with  the  general  trend of  tightening  spreads, while  in  Financing  client demand  remained  stable  and 
broadly aligned to prior year.

Executive summary 

Deutsche Bank performance 

Deutsche Bank reported a net profit of € 4.9 billion for the full year 2023, down 14% year on year, reflecting higher income tax 
expense  compared  to  2022.  In  2023,  income  tax  expense  included  positive  year  end  deferred  tax  asset  (DTA)  valuation 
adjustments of € 1.0 billion, largely reflecting continuously strong performance in the UK. This compared to a positive year 
end DTA valuation adjustment of € 1.4 billion in 2022 which related to the bank’s U.S. operations. Provision for credit losses 
was € 1.5 billion in 2023, up from € 1.2 billion in 2022, or 31 basis points of average loans, slightly above the bank’s guidance, 
reflecting the continued challenging impact of macroeconomic and interest rate conditions on parts of the credit portfolio during 
2023. Deutsche Bank published further details of its plans for distributions to shareholders, following raising its capital outlook 
by € 3 billion in October 2023. The bank plans to increase both share repurchases and dividends by 50% in 2024. The bank 
has received supervisory approvals for share repurchases of € 675 million in 2024, having completed its € 450 million 2023 
repurchase program, and plans to recommend a dividend of € 0.45 per share for 2023, up from € 0.30 per share for 2022, at 
the Annual General Meeting in May 2024.  

Profit before tax was € 5.7 billion for the full year 2023, up 2% over 2022. Revenues grew by 6% to € 28.9 billion, and by 8% 
excluding specific items. Noninterest expenses were € 21.7 billion, up 6%, with growth driven primarily by nonoperating costs 
of  € 1.1 billion,  up  from  € 474 million  in  2022.  Adjusted  costs,  which  exclude  these  nonoperating  items,  rose  3%  to 
€ 20.6 billion, as savings from efficiency measures partly offset costs relating to investments. The cost/income ratio was 75% 
in 2023, stable compared to 2022. Post-tax return on average shareholders’ equity (RoE) was 6.7% compared to 8.4% in the 
prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity (RoTE) was 7.4%, compared to 9.4% in 2022. The year-
on-year  development  in  both  ratios  partly  reflects  increased  total  equity  due  to  organic  capital  generation  and  the  higher 
income tax expense compared to 2022.

Net revenues were € 28.9 billion in 2023, up 6% year on year, and up 8% if adjusted for specific items. These items included 
a prior year gain on the sale of Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors in Italy of approximately € 310 million and € 125 million from 
workout  activities  related  to  Sal.  Oppenheim in  2022,  neither  of  which  recurred  in  2023.  Both  of  these  items  arose  in  the 
Private  Bank.  Additionally,  debt  valuation  adjustments  in  the  Investment  Bank  had  a  € 47 million  negative  impact  in  2023 
versus a € 49 million benefit in 2022. Compound annual revenue growth since 2021 for the Group was 6.6%, well above the 
bank’s original target of between 3.5% and 4.5% between 2021 and 2025. Given the progress achieved, the bank raised its 
target of a compound annual growth rate of revenues to 5.5 to 6.5% between 2021 and 2025 at the beginning of 2024.  

Provision for credit losses was € 1.5 billion in 2023, or 31 basis points of average loans, slightly above the bank’s previously 
announced guidance, reflecting the continued challenging impact of macro-economic and interest rate conditions on parts of 
the credit portfolio during the year. In 2022, provision for credit losses was € 1.2 billion, or 25 basis points of average loans.  

Noninterest  expenses  were  € 21.7 billion  in  2023,  up  6%  year  on  year.  This  development  largely  reflected  a  rise  in 
nonoperating  costs  to  € 1.1 billion,  up  from  € 474 million  in  2022,  largely  related  to  the  execution  of  the  bank’s  Global 
Hausbank strategy. 2023 nonoperating costs included restructuring and severance expenses of € 566 million, compared to a 
release of € 8 million in 2022, and impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets of € 233 million, up from € 68 million in 
2022, driven by the goodwill impairment charge related to Numis. Adjusted costs were € 20.6 billion, up 3%. Investments in 
business growth, controls and efficiency measures were partly offset by the aforementioned realized savings from the bank’s 
efficiency programs.

Annual Report 2023 

Operating and financial review 
Executive summary 

Income tax expense was € 787 million in 2023, compared to an income tax benefit of € 64 million in the prior year. The effective 
tax  rate  in  2023  of  14%  benefited  from  the  abovementioned  positive  year-end  DTA  valuation  adjustments  of  € 1.0 billion, 
largely reflecting continuously strong performance in the UK. 

Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.7% at the end of 2023, up from 13.4% at the end of 2022. Organic capital generation 
more than offset the combined impacts of dividends, share buybacks, regulatory risk weighted asset inflation and business 
growth during the year. Capital efficiency measures, which form part of Deutsche Bank’s accelerated execution of its Global 
Hausbank strategy, delivered RWA reductions of € 13 billion during 2023.  

Revenues excluding specific items, Adjusted costs, Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity and Net Assets 
(adjusted) are Non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to “Supplementary Information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP Financial

Deutsche Bank Group  

Deutsche Bank’s organization 

Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Deutsche Bank is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial 
institutions in the world, as measured by total assets of € 1,312 billion as of December 31, 2023. As of that date, the bank had 
90,130 full-time equivalent internal employees and operated in 57 countries with 1,432 branches, of which 66% were located 
in Germany. The bank offers a wide variety of investment, financial and related products and services to private individuals, 
corporate entities and institutional clients around the world. 

As of December 31, 2023, the bank was organized into the following segments: 

–  Corporate Bank 
–  Investment Bank 
–  Private Bank 
–  Asset Management 
–  Corporate & Other 

As announced in the Annual Report 2022, having fulfilled the Capital Release Unit’s de-risking and cost reduction mandate 
from 2019 through year end 2022, the Capital Release Unit ceased to be reported as a separate segment with effect from the 
first quarter of 2023. The remaining portfolio, resources and employees are reported within the Corporate & Other segment. 
In line with the change, the Core Bank, which previously represented the Group excluding the Capital Release Unit, ceased 
to be reported as of the first quarter of 2023. Prior years comparatives have been aligned to the presentation in the current 
year. 

In addition, Deutsche Bank has a country and regional organizational layer to facilitate a consistent implementation of global 
strategies.  

The bank has operations or dealings with existing and potential customers in most countries in the world. These operations 
and dealings include working through: 

–  Subsidiaries and branches 
–  Representative offices 
–  One or more representatives assigned to serve customers 

Capital expenditures or divestitures related to the divisions are included in the respective corporate division overview.

Management Structure 

The Management Board has structured the Group as a matrix organization, comprising corporate divisions and infrastructure 
functions operating in legal entities and branches across geographic locations.  

The  Management  Board  is  responsible  for  the  management  of  the  company  in  accordance  with  the  law,  the  Articles  of 
Association and the Terms of Reference for the Management Board with the objective of creating sustainable value in the 
interests of the company. It considers the interests of shareholders, employees and other company-related stakeholders. The 
Management Board manages Deutsche Bank Group in accordance with uniform guidelines; it exercises general control over 
all entities and branches. 

The Management Board decides on all matters prescribed by law and the Articles of Association and ensures compliance with 
the legal requirements and internal guidelines (compliance) and also takes the necessary measures to ensure that adequate 
internal guidelines are developed and implemented. The Management Board's responsibilities include the bank’s strategic 
management and direction, the allocation of resources, financial accounting and reporting, control and risk management, as 
well  as  corporate  control  and  a  properly  functioning  business  organization.  The  members  of  the  Management  Board  are 
collectively responsible for managing the bank’s business. 

The allocation of functional responsibilities to the individual members of the Management Board is described in its Business 
Allocation Plan, which sets the framework for the delegation of responsibilities to senior management below the Management 
Board. The Management Board endorses individual accountability of senior position holders as opposed to joint decision-
taking in committees. At the same time, the Management Board recognizes the importance of having comprehensive and 
robust information across all businesses in order to take well informed decisions and established the “Group Management 
Committee”, which aims to improve the information flow across the corporate divisions and between the corporate divisions 
and  the  Management  Board  along  with  the  Infrastructure  Committees,  Business  Executive  Committees  and  Regional 
Committees. The Group Management Committee, which is not required by the German Stock Corporation Act, is a senior 
committee that is composed of all Management Board members and the most senior business representatives to exchange 
information and to discuss business, growth and profitability.

institutions  with  certain  transaction  banking  services.  Corporate  Bank  reports  revenues  based  on  three  client  categories: 
Institutional Client Services, Corporate Treasury Services and Business Banking.  

There have been no significant capital expenditures or divestitures since January 1, 2021. 

Products and Services

services  as  well  as  securities  services. Cash  management  services  include  integrated  payments  and  FX  solutions. Trade 
finance and lending offering spans from documentary and guarantee business to structured trade finance and lending. Trust 
and agency services cover depository receipts, corporate trust and document custody. Focusing on the finance departments 
of corporate and commercial clients and financial institutions in Germany and across the globe, its holistic expertise and global 
network allows the bank to offer integrated solutions. 

In addition to Corporate Bank’s product suite, coverage teams provide clients with access to the expertise of Investment Bank. 

Distribution Channels and Marketing 
The corporate coverage function of Corporate Bank focuses on international mid and large corporate clients and is organized 
into  three  units:  Global  Coverage, MidCorps Coverage  and Risk  Management  Solutions.  Coverage  includes multi-product

Investment Bank 

Corporate Division Overview 
Investment Bank combines Deutsche Bank’s Fixed Income & Currencies (FIC) Sales & Trading and Origination & Advisory 
businesses, as well as Deutsche Bank Research. The Investment Bank focuses on its traditional strengths in these markets, 
bringing  together  wholesale  banking  expertise  across  risk  management,  sales  and  trading,  investment  banking  and 
infrastructure. This enables the Investment Bank to align resourcing and capital across its client and product perimeter to 
effectively support the bank’s strategic goals. 

Commencing from the first quarter of 2024, Investment Bank introduces additional sub-categories to FIC Sales and Trading 
revenues, entitled “Fixed Income & Currencies: Financing” and “Fixed Income & Currencies: Ex Financing”. At the same time, 
FIC Sales and Trading will be renamed to “Fixed Income & Currencies”. Origination & Advisory revenues will continue to be 
presented in the sub-categories Debt Origination, Equity Origination and Advisory. Additionally, Research revenues will be 
reported together with Other in the category “Research and Other”. 

In  April  2023,  Deutsche  Bank  announced  that  it  reached  an  agreement  on  an  all-cash  offer  for  the  acquisition  of  Numis 
Corporation Plc (“Numis”). On October 13, 2023, Deutsche Bank completed the transaction and acquired a 100% interest in 
Numis for a cash purchase price of GBP 397 million. The acquisition is intended to allow Deutsche Bank to accelerate its 
Global Hausbank strategy by unlocking a much deeper engagement with corporate clients in the United Kingdom. After the 
initial purchase price allocation, a goodwill of € 233 million related to the transaction was identified. Deutsche Bank assigned 
the identified goodwill to the Investment Bank cash-generating unit (“CGU”). Given the value of the Investment Bank CGU, 
the goodwill was considered impaired and written off in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

There have been no significant divestitures since January 1, 2021. 

Products and Services 
FIC Sales & Trading brings together institutional sales, trading and structuring  expertise across Foreign Exchange, Rates, 
Emerging  markets,  Credit  trading  and  Financing.  The  FIC  Sales  &  Trading  business  operates  globally  and  provides  both 
corporate  and  institutional  clients  liquidity,  market  making  services  and  a  range  of  specialized  risk  management  solutions 
across a broad range of FIC products, complemented by a comprehensive financing offering. The application of technology 
and continued innovation of transaction lifecycle processes is enabling Deutsche Bank to increase automation/electronification 
in order to respond to client and regulatory requirements. 

Origination & Advisory is responsible for the division’s debt origination business, mergers and acquisitions, and a focused 
equity advisory and origination platform. It is comprised of regional and industry-focused coverage teams, co-led from the 
bank’s hubs in Europe, the U.S. and Asia Pacific. This facilitates the delivery of a range of financial products and services to 
the bank’s corporate clients. 

Distribution Channels and Marketing 
Coverage of the Investment Bank’s clients is provided principally by three groups working in conjunction with each other: The 
Institutional Client Group, which houses the debt sales team, Investment Banking Coverage within Origination & Advisory and 
Risk Management Solutions in Corporate Bank, which covers capital markets and treasury solutions. The close cooperation 
between these groups helps to create enhanced synergies leading to increased cross selling of products/solutions to clients.

Corporate Division Overview 
Private Bank serves personal and private clients, wealthy individuals, entrepreneurs and families. The international businesses 
also focus on commercial clients in selected markets. Private Bank is organized along the businesses Private Bank Germany 
and International Private Bank.  

Commencing from first quarter of 2024, the Private Bank will follow a customer-focused approach by classifying the existing 
customer base into two distinct categories: Wealth Management &  Private Banking and Personal Banking. This approach 
reflects the aim to serve clients in a more targeted and effective way across the Private Bank. Wealth Management & Private 
Banking combines the coverage of private banking, high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients, as well as business clients 
in selected international businesses. The client segment Personal Banking includes retail and affluent customers as well as 
commercial banking clients in specific international businesses (i.e., all small business clients and small sized corporate clients 
that are not covered as part of the Wealth Management & Private Banking client segment). 

In August 2021, Deutsche Bank SpA signed an agreement to sell its Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy to 
Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich Italy). The transaction was closed after regulatory approval on October 17, 2022.  

There have been no significant capital expenditures since January 1, 2021. 

Products and Services 
Private  Bank’s  product  range  includes  payment  and  account  services,  credit  and  deposit  products  as  well  as  investment 
advice.  These  offerings  include  a  range  of  ESG  products,  which  enable  clients  to  access  ESG-compliant  lending  and 
investment products in line with ESG values and according to specified ESG strategies, scores and exclusionary criteria. 

Private Bank Germany pursues a differentiated, customer-focused approach with two strong and complementary main brands: 
Deutsche  Bank  and  Postbank.  The  Deutsche  Bank  brand  focuses  on  providing  their  private  customers  with  banking  and 
financial products and services that include sophisticated and individual advisory solutions. The focus of the Postbank brand 
is  on  providing  its  retail  customers  with  standard  products  and  daily  retail  banking  services  supported  by  direct  banking 
capabilities. In cooperation with Deutsche Post DHL AG, Private Bank Germany also offers postal and parcel services in the 
Postbank brand branches.  

International Private Bank also has a differentiated, customer-focused approach with two client categories: Premium Banking 
and Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs. International Private Bank provides its clients with banking and other 
financial services including support in planning, managing and investing wealth, financing personal and business interests and 
servicing institutional and corporate needs.  

Distribution Channels and Marketing 
Private Bank pursues an omni-channel approach and customers can flexibly choose between different possibilities to access 
services and products.  

The distribution channels include branch networks, supported by advisory and customer call centers, self-service terminals as 
well as digital offerings including online and mobile banking. Private Bank also has collaborations with self-employed financial 
advisors and other sales and cooperation partners, including various cooperations with Business-to-Business-to-Consumer 
partners in Germany. For the Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs client category, International Private Bank has 
a distinct client coverage team approach with relationship and investment managers supported by client service executives 
assisting  clients  with  wealth  management  services  and  open-architecture  products.  In  addition,  in  Germany,  Deutsche 
Oppenheim Family Offices AG provides family office services, discretionary funds and advisory solutions.  

The expansion of digital capabilities remains a strong focus across the businesses as a significant change in client behavior 
towards digital channels is observed. The Private Bank will continue to optimize the omni-channel mix in the future in order to 
provide customers with the most convenient access to products and services.

Infrastructure  

The Infrastructure functions perform control and service activities for the businesses, including tasks relating to Group-wide, 
cross-divisional resource-planning, steering and control, as well as tasks relating to risk, liquidity and capital management. 

The  Infrastructure  functions  are  organized  into  the  following  areas  of  responsibility  linked  to  a  dedicated  member  of  the 
Management Board: 

–  Chief Executive Office 
–  Chief Financial Office 
–  Chief Risk Office 
–  Chief Administration Office  
–  Technology, Data and Innovation 
–  Chief Operating Office 
–  CB & IB Operations and Controls 

Infrastructure  also  includes  Communications  &  Corporate  Social  Responsibility,  Chief  Sustainability  Office,  Regional 
Management,  Group  Audit,  Legal,  Business  Selection  and  Conflicts  Office,  Compliance,  Anti  Financial  Crime,  Global 
Procurement, Global Real Estate and Human Resources. 

For 2021 and 2022, costs relating to Infrastructure functions were allocated using an actual to plan approach. From the first 
quarter of 2023, the bank introduced a Driver-Based Cost Management methodology for the allocation of costs originated in 
applicable Infrastructure functions. The new approach aims to provide transparency over the drivers of Infrastructure costs 
and links costs closely to service consumption by segments. Whilst in 2023 the allocations to the corporate divisions continued 
to be based on planned allocations, except for technology development costs which are charged to divisions based on actual 
expenditures, from 2024 Infrastructure costs will all be charged to divisions based on actual costs and service consumption in 
support of the bank’s continued focus on cost discipline. 

Significant capital expenditures and divestitures 

Information on each corporate division’s significant capital expenditures and divestitures for the last three financial years has 
been included in the above descriptions of the corporate divisions.  

Since January 1, 2021, there have been no public takeover offers by third parties with respect to Deutsche Bank’s shares.

2023 
Net interest income was € 13.6 billion in 2023, a decrease of € 48 million compared to 2022 primarily driven by higher interest 
rates  on  deposits,  which  were  partly  offset  by  the  benefits  of  higher  interest  rates  on  loans.  Net  interest  income  included 
interest  expenses  of  € 741 million  under  the  Targeted  Long-Term  Refinancing  Operation  III  (TLTRO  III)  program  in  2023, 
whereas 2022 included interest income of € 211 million under this program. Overall, the bank's net interest margin was at 
1.40% in 2023, up 1 basis point compared to the prior year.  

2022 
Net interest income was € 13.6 billion in 2022 compared to € 11.2 billion in 2021, an increase of € 2.5 billion or 22%, driven 
by  higher  interest  rates  and  strong  underlying  business  performance  partly  offset  by  lower  benefits  from  the  TLTRO III 
program. Interest income included € 211 million under the TLTRO III program in 2022, whereas 2021 included € 494 million 
under this program. Overall, the bank’s net interest margin was 1.39% in 2022, an increase of 20 basis points compared to 
the prior year.

2023 
Net gains on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss were € 4.9 billion in 2023, compared to € 3.0 billion 
in 2022. The increase of € 1.9 billion, or 65% was driven by positive impacts from interest rate hedges in Corporate & Other 
and an increase in Asset Management from valuation adjustments on guaranteed funds, which had a corresponding offset in 
other income. The Investment Bank benefited from the non-recurrence of prior year losses on loan commitments and hedge 
activities  in  2023.  These  drivers  were  partly  offset  by  decreases  in  the  Private  Bank,  mainly  due  to  lower  mark-to-market 
impacts from hedge activities, which had a partial offsetting effect in other income, and revaluation losses in the Corporate 
Bank compared to gains in the prior year.  

2022 
Net gains on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss were € 3.0 billion in 2022, a decrease of € 45 million 
compared to 2021 driven by negative impacts from interest rate hedges in Corporate & Other as well as an unfavorable change 
in the fair value of guarantees in Asset Management, which had a corresponding offset in other income. The overall decrease 
was partly offset by positive mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in the Investment Bank driven by the ongoing heightened 
market activity and strong client flows as well as mark-to-market gains from hedge activities in Private Bank, which had an 
offsetting effect in other income.

Net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss  

The  bank’s  trading  and  risk  management  activities  include  interest  rate  instruments  and  related  derivatives.  Under  IFRS, 
interest and similar income earned from trading instruments and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (i.e., 
coupon and dividend income) and the costs of funding net trading positions are part of net interest income. The bank’s trading 
activities can periodically shift income between net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss depending on a variety of factors, including risk management strategies.  

In order to provide a more business focused discussion, the following table presents net interest income and net gains (losses)

total revenues by product please refer to Note 4 “Business Segments and related information” of this report 

2023 
Total  net  interest  income  and  net  gains  (losses)  on  financial  assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  were 
€ 18.5 billion in 2023, compared to € 16.6 billion in 2022, an increase of € 1.9 billion. This impact was largely attributable to 
an overall increase in net interest income and positive impacts from interest rate hedges. In the Corporate Bank, total net 
interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss increased by € 1.3 billion, 
primarily due to higher net interest income driven by an improved interest rate environment and continued pricing discipline. 
Total net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in Investment 
Bank decreased by € 0.2 billion due to lower net interest income, partly offset by mark-to-market gains on derivatives in FIC 
Sales & Trading. Total net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss  in  the  Private  Bank  decreased  by  € 0.2 billion  compared  to  prior  year,  driven  by  mark-to-market  impacts  from  hedge 
activities,  with  an  offsetting  effect  in  other  income,  partly  offset  by  higher  interest  income  from  an  improved  interest  rate 
environment. The overall movement was supported by positive impacts in Corporate & Other amounting to approximately 
€ 0.7 billion, including benefits from interest rate hedges, as well as in Asset Management of € 0.2 billion, mainly from a more 
favorable change in the fair value of guarantees.  

2022 
Total  net  interest  income  and  net  gains  (losses)  on  financial  assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  were 
€ 16.6 billion in 2022, compared to € 14.2 billion in 2021, an increase of  € 2.4 billion. This was primarily due to higher net 
interest income driven by an improved interest rate environment and solid underlying business performance. Total net interest 
income  and  net  gains  (losses)  on  financial  assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  increased  by  € 1.8 billion  in 
Private Bank. This impact was largely attributable to higher mark-to-market gains from hedge activities which had an offsetting 
effect in other income. Higher interest rates and continued business growth also had a positive impact on the year-on-year 
increase; these were also the main drivers for the increase in Corporate Bank by € 1.1 billion. Total net interest income and 
net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in Investment Bank increased by € 1.4 billion 
due to higher positive mark-to-market impacts on derivatives in FIC Sales & Trading driven by the ongoing heightened market 
activity  and  strong  clients  flows.  These  overall  positive  effects  were  partially  offset  by  negative  impacts  of  € 1.2 billion  in 
Corporate & Other, mainly from valuation and timing differences on derivatives and interest rate hedges, as well as in Asset 
Management of € 0.5 billion, mainly from a less favorable change in the fair value of guarantees.

Provision for credit losses 

2023 
Provision for credit losses was € 1.5 billion in 2023, up from € 1.2 billion in 2022 or 31 basis points of average loans reflecting 
the  continued  challenging  macro-economic  and  interest  rate  conditions  for  parts  of  the  credit  portfolio  during  the  year.  In 
particular, the Commercial Real Estate sector, and specifically the office sector, was affected by a post-COVID-19-pandemic 
driven change in demand and came under further pressure from interest rate increases, which led to higher refinancing risks. 
Provision for non-performing loans related to Stage 3 was € 1.5 billion, spread across various regions and segments, including 
a notable share of € 400 million related to Commercial Real Estate, especially affecting the Investment Bank. Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 provision for performing loans was a release of € 33 million, driven by an improved macro-economic outlook compared 
to 2022 and benefits from model-related changes.  

2022 
Provision for credit losses was € 1.2 billion in 2022, up from € 515 million in 2021. The year-on-year development reflected 
more  challenging  macroeconomic  conditions during  most  of  2022  against  the  backdrop  of  the  war in  Ukraine, while  2021 
benefited from an economic recovery following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Provisions were 25 basis points of average 
loans. Provisions for non-performing loans related to Stage 3 was € 1.0 billion, spread across regions and segments. Stage 1 
and Stage 2 provision for performing loans was € 204 million, driven by deteriorating macro-economic forecasts through most 
of the year.  

The sections “Segment results of operations” and “Risk Report” provide further details on provision for credit losses.

Commissions and fee income 
2023 
Commissions and fee income was € 9.2 billion in 2023, a decrease of € 632 million or 6% compared to 2022. The decrease 
was driven by lower intermediary fees and transactional revenues as well as changes in contractual conditions in the Private 
Bank and lower fee income in the Investment Bank primarily due to lower M&A activities. In addition, the decrease was also 
driven  by  lower  management  fees  from  unfavorable  market  conditions  coupled  with  margin  compression  in  Asset 
Management.  

2022 
Commissions and fee income was € 9.8 billion in 2022, a decrease of € 1.1 billion or 10% compared to 2021. The decrease 
was driven by significantly lower Origination & Advisory revenues in Investment Bank reflecting continued challenging industry 
environment, lower Leveraged Debt Capital Markets revenues and a materially reduced fee pool relative to the previous year. 
In addition, commission and fee income in Private Bank declined reflecting a more challenging macroeconomic environment. 
In Asset Management performance fees were significantly lower than the previous year due to the absence of a large Multi 
Asset performance fee reported in 2021. These were partly offset by an increase in commissions and fee income in Corporate 
Bank driven by solid underlying business performance. 

Net gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
2023 
Net  gains  (losses)  on  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  were  € (0) million  in  2023  and 
€ (216) million in 2022, with the result in the prior year driven by a sale of bonds  and securities from the strategic liquidity 
reserve. 

2022 
Net  gains  (losses) on  financial  assets at  fair value  through  other comprehensive  income were  € (216) million  in  2022  and 
€ 237 million in 2021, with the result in both periods driven by the sale of  bonds and securities from the strategic liquidity 
reserve. 

Net gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost 
2023 
Net gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost were € (96) million in 2023 compared to € (2) million in 2022, driven 
by realized losses on disposal of loans held in the hold to collect portfolio. 

2022 
Net gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost were € (2) million in 2022 compared to € 1 million in 2021, driven by 
the hold-to-collect portfolio. 

Net income (loss) from equity method investments 
2023 
Net income (loss) from equity method investments was € (38) million in 2023 compared to € 152 million in 2022, a decrease 
of  € 190 million,  mainly  related  to  the  downward  valuation  of  the  underlying  loan  assets  in  Huarong  Rongde  Asset 
Management Company Limited as well as a gain on exit in 2022 which did not repeat. 

2022 
Net income (loss) from equity method investments was € 152 million in 2022 compared to € 98 million in 2021, an increase of 
€ 54 million,  or  56%,  related  to  lower  impairments  in  Huarong  Rongde  Asset  Management  Company  Limited  in  2022  as 
compared to 2021.  

Other income (loss) 
2023 
Other income (loss) was € 1.3 billion in 2023 compared to € 789 million in 2022. The improvement was primarily related to 
gains in the hedging portfolios and the non-recurrence from gains on disposal of assets held for sale, including a gain from 
the sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy, as well as from workout activities related to Sal. Oppenheim 
recognized in other revenues in the prior year. This was partly offset by an unfavorable impact from valuation adjustments on 
fair value of guarantees in Asset Management, which had a corresponding offset in net gains (losses) on financial assets/ 
liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. 

2022 
Other income (loss) was € 789 million in 2022 compared to € (58) million in 2021. The improvement was driven by a favorable 
impact from valuation adjustments on fair value of guarantees in Asset Management, which had a corresponding offsetting 
effect in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, from gains on disposal of assets 
held for sale, including a gains from the sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy and from workout 
activities related to Sal. Oppenheim recognized in other revenues. This was partly offset by a decrease in income in Private 
Bank driven by the contra-effect of the aforementioned positive impacts in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss.

report 

Compensation and benefits 
2023 
Compensation and benefits increased by € 418 million or 4% to € 11.1 billion in 2023 compared to € 10.7 billion in 2022. The 
increase was driven mainly by wage growth, an increase in external workforce as well as an increase in severance costs 
resulting from the accelerated execution of the banks Global Hausbank strategy.  

2022 
Compensation and benefits increased by € 294 million or 3% to € 10.7 billion in 2022 compared to € 10.4 billion in 2021. The 
increase was driven primarily by adverse foreign exchange movements, with higher salary costs. 

General and administrative expenses 
2023 
General and administrative expenses increased by € 384 million or 4% to € 10.1 billion in 2023 compared to € 9.7 billion in 
2022. The increase was driven by higher expenses in information technology mainly relating to increased vendor and software 
costs as well as higher operational taxes. This was partly offset by lower litigation expenses which decreased by € 103 million, 
related to a release of litigation provision and a decrease in bank levies of € 235 million.  

2022 
General and administrative expenses decreased by € 1.1 billion or 10% to € 9.7 billion in 2022 compared to € 10.8 billion in 
2021. The decrease was driven by a significant decline in transformation charges as the bank completed the transformation 
initiatives  announced  in  2019.  Further  reductions  were  across  major  cost  categories,  reflecting  the  bank’s  continued  cost 
reduction efforts. Litigation expenses decreased by € 53 million, partly related to a provision release related to the German 
Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruling on pricing arrangements. The declines were partly offset by a year-on-year rise in bank 
levies of € 210 million. 

Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
2023 
Impairment  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets  was  € 233 million  relating  to  the  impaired  goodwill  of  Numis  in  the 
Investment  Bank  in  2023,  compared  to  € 68 million  relating  to  a  historic  acquisition  of  an  unamortized  intangible  asset 
associated with U.S. mutual fund retail contracts in Asset Management in 2022. 

2022 
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was € 68 million in 2022, relating to the aforementioned historic acquisition 
in Asset Management, compared to € 5 million in the Corporate Bank in 2021.

Restructuring 
2023 
Restructuring activities were charges of € 220 million in 2023 compared to a release of € (118) million in 2022. The charges 
were driven primarily by Private Bank in the context of the execution of strategic initiatives. 

2022 
Restructuring  activities  were  a  release  of  € (118) million  in  2022  compared  to  charges  of  € 261 million  in  2021.  The 
development in both periods was driven primarily by Private Bank in the context of the execution of strategic objectives. 

Income tax expense 
2023 
Income tax expense was € 787 million in 2023, compared to an income tax benefit of € 64 million in the prior year. The effective 
tax  rate  in  2023  of  14%  benefited  from  positive  year  end  deferred  tax  asset  valuation  adjustments  of  € 1.0 billion,  largely 
reflecting continuously strong performance in the UK. 

2022 
Income tax benefit in 2022 was € 64 million compared to an income tax expense of € 880 million in 2021. The effective tax 
rate  in  2022  of  (1)%  benefited  from  a  positive  year  end  deferred  tax  asset  valuation  adjustment  of  € 1.4 billion,  reflecting 
continued strong performance in Deutsche Bank’s U.S. operations. 

Net profit (loss) 
2023 
Net profit in 2023 was € 4.9 billion, compared to € 5.7 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net profit was primarily driven 
by the aforementioned increase in income tax expense compared to 2022, including the aforementioned year end deferred 
tax asset valuation adjustments.  

2022 
Net profit in 2022 was € 5.7 billion, compared to € 2.5 billion in the prior year. The increase in net profit was primarily driven 
by strong revenue performance across core businesses, reduced noninterest expenses and the aforementioned tax benefit 
from a year end deferred tax asset valuation adjustment. Partly offsetting was an increase in provision for credit losses.

Results of operations 

2023 
Profit before tax of the Corporate Bank was € 3.0 billion for the full year 2023, up from € 1.8 billion in 2022, driven by higher 
revenues  and  lower  provision  for  credit  losses,  partly  offset  by  higher  noninterest  expenses.  Post-tax  return  on  average 
shareholders’ equity was 15.2%, up from 10.0% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity 
was 16.6%, up from 10.9% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio was 58%, down from 66% in 2022. 

Full year net revenues were € 7.7 billion, 22% higher year on year, driven by increased interest rates and continued pricing 
discipline, while commission and fee income remained essentially flat. Deposit volume remained essentially flat, while loan 
volume  lowered  by  € 5 billion,  or  4%,  due  to  a  more  selective  balance  sheet  deployment  and  negative  impact  from 
FX movements.  

All  of  the  Corporate  Bank’s  businesses  contributed  to  revenue  growth.  Corporate  Treasury  Services  net  revenues  were 
€ 4.4 billion, up 14% year on year, driven by increased interest rates coupled with essentially flat deposit volume. Institutional 
Client Services net revenues were € 1.9 billion, 20% higher year on year, benefitting from higher interest rates and higher 
deposit volume. Business Banking net revenues were € 1.4 billion, 55% higher year on year, reflecting higher interest rate 
and lagging deposit payouts in Germany supported by essentially flat business volumes. 

Provision  for  credit  losses  in  2023  was  € 266 million,  or  23  basis  points  of  average  loans,  compared  to  provisions  of 
€ 335 million, or 27 basis points of average loans, in 2022. The reduction reflects releases of Stage 1 and 2 provisions driven 
by improved macroeconomic outlook and model changes. 

Noninterest expenses were € 4.5 billion, up 7% year on year, mainly due to increased nonoperating costs, internal service 
cost allocations and noncompensation direct costs. 

2022 
Profit before tax of the Corporate Bank was € 1.8 billion for the full year 2022, up from € 0.6 billion in 2021, driven by higher 
revenues and lower noninterest expenses, partly offset by increased provision for credit losses. Post-tax return on average 
shareholders’ equity was 10.0%, up from 3.2% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity was 
10.9%, up from 3.5% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio was 66%, down from 88% in 2021. 

Full year net revenues were € 6.3 billion, 23% higher year on year. Revenue growth was driven by increased interest rates 
and continued pricing discipline, higher commission and fee income as well as deposit growth and favorable foreign exchange 
rate movements. Deposits grew by € 18 billion, or 7%, during the year while loan volume decreased by € 1 billion, or 1%.  

All  of  the  Corporate  Bank’s  businesses  contributed  to  revenue  growth.  Corporate  Treasury  Services  net  revenues  were 
€ 3.8 billion, up 24% year on year, driven by increased interest rates across all markets, growth in commission and fee income 
and higher deposits. Institutional Client Services net revenues were € 1.6 billion, 22% higher year on year, benefitting from 
higher interest rates and favorable foreign exchange movements. Business Banking net revenues were € 930 million, 19% 
higher year on year, reflecting transition to a positive interest rate environment in Germany in the second half of 2022 and 
higher commission and fee income from account repricing. 

Provision  for  credit  losses  was  € 335 million  in  the  year,  or  27  basis  points  of  average  loans,  reflecting  the  weakened 
macroeconomic environment, from essentially nil in the prior year. 

Noninterest expenses were € 4.2 billion, down 8% year on year, as a positive contribution from noncompensation initiatives 
and lower nonoperating costs were partly offset by foreign exchange rate movements.

2023 
Profit before tax in 2023 was € 1.8 billion, down € 1.4 billion, or 43% compared to 2022. This reflects a decline of profit before 
tax in FIC Sales & Trading revenues compared to a very strong prior year, higher costs driven by strategic investments into 
the  business,  including  the  acquisition  of  Numis,  and  increased  Provision  for  credit  losses.  Post-tax  return  on  average 
shareholders’ equity was 3.8%, down from 8.0% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity 
was 4.0%, down from 8.4% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio in 2023 was 75%, compared to 65% in 2022. 

Net revenues were € 9.2 billion, a decrease of € 856 million, or 9% year on year.  

Revenues in FIC Sales & Trading were € 8.0 billion, down € 961 million, or 11% compared to 2022, which was the best FIC 
revenue performance in a decade. Revenues in Rates, Emerging Markets and Foreign Exchange were all significantly lower, 
reflecting reduced levels of market volatility and activity. Credit Trading revenues were significantly higher due to the improved 
performance of Credit Flow following investments into the business. Financing revenues were robust and essentially flat to 
the prior year.

Operating and financial review 
Results of operations 

Origination & Advisory revenues were € 1.2 billion, an increase of € 249 million, or 25% year on year. This was primarily driven 
by the non-recurrence of material leveraged lending markdowns in Leveraged Debt Capital Markets. Investment Grade debt 
revenues were lower, reflecting a decline in the industry fee pool (source: Dealogic). Advisory revenues were significantly 
lower due to reduced levels of announced deals coming into 2023. Equity Origination revenues were essentially flat to the 
prior year. 

Other  revenues  were  negative  € 60 million,  compared  to  positive  € 84 million  in  2022.  The  year-on-year  decrease  was 
materially driven by a loss of € 47 million relating to the impact of debt valuation adjustments on certain derivative liabilities 
versus a gain of € 49 million in the prior year.  

Provision for credit losses was € 431 million, or 42 basis points of average loans, an increase of € 112 million year on year 
due to increased levels of stage 3 impairments, primarily in relation to Commercial Real Estate. 

Noninterest  expenses  in  2023  were  € 6.9 billion,  an  increase  of  € 424 million  or  7%  year  on  year,  primarily  driven  by  an 
impairment of Goodwill due to the Numis acquisition, as well as strategic investments made across the business and in line 
with the previously communicated strategy. 

2022 
Profit before tax was € 3.2 billion in 2022, a decrease of € 241 million versus a very strong prior year. Slightly higher revenues 
were more than offset by significantly higher provision for credit losses and slightly higher noninterest expenses. Post-tax 
return  on  average  shareholders’  equity  was  8.0%,  down  from  9.0%  in  the  prior  year.  Post-tax  return  on  average  tangible 
shareholders’ equity was 8.4%, down from 9.4% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio in 2022 was 65%, compared to 63% 
in 2021. 

Net revenues were € 10.0 billion in 2022, an increase of € 385 million, or 4% compared to 2021. 

Revenues in FIC Sales & Trading were € 8.9 billion, an increase of € 1.9 billion, or 26%, versus the prior year, with strong 
year on year growth across the majority of the franchise. Rates, Foreign Exchange and Emerging Markets revenues were all 
significantly higher, reflecting heightened levels of market activity, increased client flows and disciplined risk management. 
Financing  revenues  were  higher,  driven  primarily  by  higher  net  interest  income,  as  a  result  of  increased  lending  activity. 
Revenues  in  Credit  Trading  were  significantly  lower  due  to  the  non-recurrence  of  the  contribution  from  a  concentrated 
distressed credit position in the prior year and a challenging market environment. 

Origination & Advisory net revenues were € 1.0 billion, a decrease of € 1.6 billion, or 62%, compared to the prior year. Debt 
Origination revenues were € 412 million, significantly lower than the prior year driven principally by Leveraged Debt Capital 
Markets, where revenues were impacted by a material decline in the industry fee pool and loan markdowns, which were seen 
across the industry. Investment Grade debt revenues were also lower, however decreased by less than the industry average 
(source: Dealogic). Equity Origination revenues of € 101 million were significantly lower, reflecting a material decline in primary 
equity issuance during the year. Advisory revenues of € 485 million were essentially flat to 2021, in a fee pool that was down 
approximately 15% (source: Dealogic).  

Other  revenues  were  positive  € 84 million,  compared  to  negative  € 40 million  in  2021.  The  year-on-year  increase  was 
materially driven by a gain of € 49 million relating to the impact of debt valuation adjustments on certain derivative liabilities 
versus  a  loss  of  € 28 million  in  2021.  Additionally,  2021  was  negatively  impacted  by  the  reversal  of  previously  recorded 
Collateralized  Loan  Obligation hedge  gains,  which  had  resulted  from  the  release  of  underlying  provision  for credit losses. 
These did not re-occur in 2022. 

Provision for credit losses was € 319 million, or 32 basis points of average loans, an increase of € 215 million versus prior 
year,  primarily  driven  by  a  weakened  macroeconomic  environment  whilst  the  prior  year  benefited  from  a  post  COVID-19 
recovery. 

Noninterest  expenses  in  2022 were  € 6.5 billion,  an  increase  of  € 379 million or  6% compared  to  prior  year,  reflecting  the 
impact of foreign exchange translation and increased bank levies.

Results of operations 

2023 
Private Bank recorded a profit before tax of € 1.0 billion in 2023, compared to € 1.7 billion in the prior year, a decline of 41%. 
The  year-on-year  development  reflected  significant  nonoperating  costs  and  revenue  items.  Nonoperating  costs  were 
€ 468 million in 2023, compared to a benefit of € 147 million in 2022. Furthermore, 2022 revenues included € 430 million in 
specific items which did not recur in 2023. These items impacted key ratios, with the cost/income ratio rising to 81%, from 
75% in the prior year, while post-tax return on average shareholders’ equity declined to 4.1%, from 8.3% in 2022 and post-tax 
return on average tangible shareholders’ equity declined to 4.5%, from 9.0% in the prior year. Excluding nonoperating cost 
and specific revenue items, profit before tax would have been up 30% year on year. 

Net revenues were  € 9.6 billion, up 5% year on year, or up 10% if adjusted for the non-recurrence of the aforementioned 
€ 430 million  of  specific  items  from  last  year.  These  included  a  gain  of  approximately  € 310 million  from  the  sale  of  the 
Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy, and positive impacts from Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Revenue 
growth  was  driven  by  higher  net  interest  income  from  deposit  products,  partly  offset  by  lower  fee  income  and  lower  loan 
revenues  in  a  rising  interest  rate  environment.  The  Private  Bank  attracted  net  inflows  into  assets  under  management  of 
€ 29 billion  in  2023,  with  net  inflows  in  both  investment  products  and  deposits.  Loan  development  reflected  lower  client 
demand, mainly in mortgage loans in Germany and client deleveraging in APAC. 

In Private Bank Germany, net revenues grew by 14% to € 6.1 billion as higher net interest income from deposit products more 
than offset impacts from lower fee income due to changes in contractual and regulatory conditions. 

In  the  International  Private  Bank,  net  revenues  were  € 3.5 billion,  down  8%  year  on  year,  or  up  5%  if  adjusted  for  the 
aforementioned  impact  of  specific  items,  from  non-recurring  revenues  of  approximately  € 50 million  following  the business 
divestiture in Italy. Higher deposit revenues were offset by lower loan and investment revenues mainly in the APAC region. 

Assets under management in the Private Bank were € 559 billion at year end, up € 40 billion in the year. The increase was 
mainly driven by net inflows of € 29 billion and by a € 19 billion beneficial impact from higher market levels partly offset by 
€ 4 billion negative impact from foreign exchange rate movements. 

Provision for credit losses was € 783 million, or 30 basis points of average loans, compared to € 583 million, or 22 basis points 
of average loans in the prior year. The increase mainly reflected a more difficult macroeconomic environment, higher impacts 
of single name losses in the International Private Bank and effects from temporary operational backlog related to the Postbank 
IT migration, while provision for credit losses in 2022 benefited from releases following sales of non-performing loans. The 
development of the overall portfolio continued to reflect the high quality of the loan book, especially in the retail businesses, 
and ongoing tight risk discipline. 

Noninterest expenses were € 7.8 billion, up 14% year on year, driven predominantly by the aforementioned € 468 million in 
nonoperating costs, including restructuring and severance of € 346 million and litigation charges of € 123 million, compared 
to releases of nonoperating costs of € 147 million in 2022. Adjusted costs, which exclude these items, were up 4%, mainly 
reflecting  investments  in  Group  control  functions,  strategic  initiatives,  higher  internal  cost  allocations,  Postbank  service 
remediation  and  inflation  impacts.  These  were  partly  mitigated  by  continued  savings  from  transformation  programs  and 
reduced regulatory charges.

2022 
Private Bank  recorded  a  profit  before  tax  of  € 1.7 billion  in 2022  compared  to  a  loss  of  € 133 million in  the  prior  year,  the 
highest profit before tax since the formation of Private Bank in 2019. Post-tax return on average shareholders’ equity was 
8.3%, up from negative 1.5% in 2021, with post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity rose to 9.0%, up from 
negative 1.7% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio improved to 75%, down from 96% in the prior year, reflecting growth of 
11% in revenues combined with a reduction of 14% in noninterest expenses. 

Net revenues grew to € 9.2 billion, up 11% year on year. The increase partly reflected higher specific revenue items, mainly a 
gain of approximately € 310 million from the sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy, as well as the 
positive impact of reduced forgone revenues related to the 2021 German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruling on pricing 
agreements. Adjusted for these impacts, net revenues grew by 6% year on year, driven by higher net interest income, foreign 
exchange rate movements and continued business growth. Business growth was € 41 billion in 2022 and reflected net inflows 
into assets under management of € 30 billion, including net inflows into investment products of € 25 billion and deposits of 
€ 5 billion, as well as net new client loans of € 11 billion. 

Private Bank Germany generated net revenues of € 5.3 billion, up 6% year on year, partly reflecting the reduction in forgone 
revenues from the BGH ruling. Adjusted for this impact, revenues were up 4% as higher net interest income from deposit 
products  more  than  offset  the  impacts  of  lower  loan  revenues  and  fee  income  in  a  more  challenging  macro-economic 
environment. 

In  International  Private  Bank,  net  revenues  were  € 3.8 billion,  up  19%  year  on  year,  and  up  9%  if  adjusted  for  the 
aforementioned gain on sale, and for Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Revenue growth was mainly attributable to higher 
deposit  revenues  due  to  interest  rate  increases,  continued  loan  book  expansion  and  positive  foreign  exchange  rate 
movements. Revenues from investment products benefitted from net inflows but were also impacted by a more challenging 
market  environment.  International  Private  Bank  attracted  net  new  volumes  of  € 29 billion  across  loans  and  assets  under 
management in the full year, the highest since its formation. 

Assets under management in Private Bank declined by € 36 billion to € 518 billion at year end. This development reflected 
€ 56 billion in negative impacts from market developments and a € 15 billion disposal net effect after the sale of the Financial 
Advisors business in Italy, partly offset by € 30 billion net inflows and a € 6 billion positive impact from foreign exchange rate 
movements. 

Provision for credit losses was € 583 million, or 22 basis points of average loans, partly driven by certain single exposures in 
the international franchise. Excluding these, the development of the overall portfolio continued to reflect the high quality of the 
loan book and ongoing tight risk discipline. This compares to € 446 million provision for credit losses in the prior year, which 
benefitted from a more stable macroeconomic environment. 

Noninterest expenses were € 6.8 billion, a reduction of 14% year on year. This development reflected a positive impact from 
the release of litigation provisions recorded in the prior year related to the BGH ruling, lower restructuring expenses in the 
context of the execution of strategic objectives and a year-on-year reduction in adjusted costs of 7%. The latter was driven by 
incremental savings from transformation initiatives including workforce reductions and the closure of more than 170 branches. 
Ongoing  cost  management  and  lower  internal  service  cost  allocations  also  contributed  to  the  reduction  in  adjusted  costs. 
These effects were partly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange rate movements.

refer to “Supplementary Information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP Financial Measures” of this Annual Report 

2023 
Profit before tax was € 396 million, down 32%, mainly driven by lower revenues. Post-tax return on average shareholders’ 
equity was 4.9%, down from 7.4% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity was 11.3%, down 
from 17.1% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio was 77%, up from 71% in 2022. 

Net revenues in 2023 were € 2.4 billion, down 9% compared to 2022, resulting from significantly lower other revenues driven 
by higher funding costs and lower investment income, as well as slightly lower management fees due  to negative market 
developments,  the  composition  of  the  net  inflows  in  Alternatives  and  margin  compression  in  other  product  classes. 
Performance and transaction fees were essentially flat compared to full year 2022. 

Noninterest expenses were € 1.8 billion in 2023, down 1%. Adjusted costs increased by 3%, mainly due to higher IT costs to 
support  transformation  and  higher  banking  servicing  costs  driven  by  a  rise  in  assets  under  management  in  the  Passive 
business, while compensation and benefits remained essentially flat. Non-operating costs were significantly lower due to a 
€ 68 million impairment of an unamortized intangible asset related to U.S. mutual fund retail contracts in the prior year.  

Net flows were positive € 28 billion, primarily in Passive, Cash and Multi Assets products. This was partly offset by net outflows 
in Equity and Systematic & Quantitative Investments (SQI), while net flows in Alternatives and Fixed Income being essentially 
flat. ESG products attracted net inflows of € 5 billion in 2023 primarily into Xtrackers. 

Assets under Management increased by € 75 billion, or 9%, to € 896 billion during 2023, mainly driven by positive market 
developments and net inflows, while foreign exchange rate movements had a negative impact.

2022 
Profit before tax was € 584 million, down 28%, mainly driven by significantly lower performance fees and other income, and 
an  impairment  of  intangibles  assets.  Adjusted  for  restructuring  and  severance  expenses  and  impairments of  goodwill  and 
other intangible assets, profit before tax was € 689 million, down 17%. Post-tax return on average shareholders’ equity was 
7.4%, down from 11.0% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity was 17.1%, down from 
25.8% in the prior year. The cost/income ratio was 71%, up from 62% in 2021. 

Net revenues for 2022 were € 2.6 billion, down 4%, as higher management fees were more than offset by significantly lower 
performance fees, reflecting the non-recurrence of a performance fee of € 89 million from an Active Asset fund recognized in 
2021, and significantly lower other revenues. 

Noninterest expenses were € 1.8 billion in 2022, up 11%. Adjusted costs increased by 5%, mainly due to higher compensation 
and benefits driven by a rise in headcount to support transformation and growth. Non-operating costs include a € 68 million 
impairment of an unamortized intangible asset related to U.S. mutual fund retail contracts. The cost/income ratio was 71%, 
up 9 percentage points compared to the prior year. 

Net flows were negative € 20 billion, primarily in lower margin products Fixed Income, Cash and Passive, impacted by industry-
wide pressure on flows. This was partly offset by net inflows in higher-margin products Multi Asset and Alternatives. ESG 
products attracted net inflows of € 1 billion in 2022 despite the adverse environment. 

Assets under Management decreased by € 106 billion, or 11%, to € 821 billion during 2022, mainly driven by negative market 
developments and net outflows, while foreign exchange rate movements had a positive impact.

2023 
Corporate & Other reported a loss before tax of € 0.6 billion in 2023 compared to a loss before tax of € 1.7 billion in 2022, 
reflecting higher revenues and lower noninterest expenses. 

Net revenues were positive € 45 million in 2023, compared to negative € 904 million in 2022. Revenues related to valuation 
and  timing  differences  were  positive  € 792 million  in  2023,  compared  to  negative  € 119 million  in  2022,  the  year-on-year 
improvement driven by market moves and the reversion of prior period losses. Net revenues relating to funding and liquidity 
were negative € 242 million in 2023, versus negative € 311 million in 2022. 

Noninterest expenses were € 738 million in 2023, a reduction of € 299 million, or 29%, compared to 2022. The reduction was 
primarily driven by positive € 37 million litigation releases in 2023, compared to a charge of € 261 million in 2022. Expenses 
associated  with  shareholder  activities  as  defined  in  the  OECD  Transfer  Pricing  guidelines  not  allocated  to  the  business 
divisions were € 582 million in 2023, versus € 510 million in 2022. 

Noncontrolling interests are deducted from the profit before tax of the divisions and reversed in Corporate & Other. These 
amounted to € 166 million in 2023, compared to € 190 million in 2022, mainly related to DWS. 

2022 
Corporate & Other reported a loss before tax of € 1.7 billion in 2022 compared to a loss before tax of € 1.4 billion in 2021, 
primarily reflecting higher negative net revenues. 

Net revenues were negative € 904 million in 2022, compared to negative € 314 million in 2021. Revenues related to valuation 
and timing differences were negative € 119 million in 2022, compared to positive € 158 million in 2021. Net revenues relating 
to funding and liquidity were negative € 311 million in 2022, versus negative € 242 million in 2021. 

Noninterest expenses were  € 1.0 billion in 2022, compared to  € 1.3 billion in 2021, a reduction of 19% year on year. This 
reduction  was  primarily  driven  by  legacy  portfolios,  reflecting  lower  internal  service  charges  and  a  decline  in  direct 
compensation and noncompensation costs. Expenses associated with shareholder activities as defined in the OECD Transfer 
Pricing guidelines not allocated to the business divisions were € 510 million in 2022, versus € 460 million in 2021. 

Noncontrolling interests are deducted from the profit before tax of the divisions and reversed in Corporate  & Other. These 
amounted to € 190 million in 2022, compared to € 206 million in 2021, mainly related to DWS.

As of December 31, 2023, the total balance sheet of € 1.3 trillion was essentially flat compared to year-end 2022.  

Trading assets increased by € 32.4 billion, mainly due to increased exposure in government securities from higher client flows 
and desk positioning in relation to the current environment. Corresponding liabilities decreased by € 6.6 billion, primarily driven 
by decreased short positions in government bonds in Europe rates business. 

Positive  and  negative  market  values  of  derivative  financial  instruments  decreased  by  € 47.8 billion  and  € 44.1 billion, 
respectively, driven by foreign exchange products primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and de-
risking. The decline was also observed in interest rate products due to moves in interest rate curves. 

Loans at amortized cost decreased by € 10.0 billion, primarily driven by lower demand and continued selective balance sheet 
deployment in the Corporate Bank as well as lower mortgage origination in the Private Bank. 

Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss increased by € 29.1 billion, mainly attributable to an increase 
in  securities  sold  under  repurchase  agreements  as  a  result  of  increased  secured  funding  of  trading  inventory  and  client 
activities; as well as an increase in long term debt driven by new issuances in FIC business in the Investment Bank.  

Other short-term borrowings increased by € 4.5 billion, mainly driven by newly issued commercial paper. 

Long term debt at amortized cost decreased by € 12.1 billion as a result of prepayment of TLTRO and matured issuances, 
which were partly offset by new issuances during the year. 

The overall movement of the balance sheet included a decrease of € 18.6 billion due to foreign exchange rate movements, 
mainly  driven  by  a  weakening  of  the  U.S.  dollar  versus  the  euro.  The  effects  from  foreign  exchange  rate  movements  are 
embedded in the movement of the balance sheet line items discussed in this section.

Operating and financial review 
Financial Position 

Liquidity 

Total High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) as defined by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 and amended by 
Regulation  (EU)  2018/1620  remained  flat  at  € 219 billion  for  both  December  31,  2023,  and  December  31,  2022.  This  is 
primarily due to the repayment of TLTRO liabilities offset by business portfolio movements. The Group maintains additional 
highly liquid central bank eligible assets, not qualifying as HQLA or subject to transfer restrictions under the HQLA definition. 
These additional liquid assets were € 42 billion, such that the Group’s total Liquidity Reserves were € 261 billion as at the end 
of December 31, 2023. As at the end of December 31, 2022, these additional liquid assets were € 37 billion, such that the 
Group’s total Liquidity Reserves were € 256 billion. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 140% at the end fourth quarter of 2023, 
a surplus to regulatory requirements of € 62 billion as compared to 142% as at the end of fourth quarter of 2022, a surplus to 
regulatory requirements of € 64 billion. 

Equity  

Total equity as of December 31, 2023, was € 74.8 billion compared to € 72.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 
€ 2.5 billion. This change was driven by a number of factors including the profit attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders 
and additional equity components reported for the period of € 4.8 billion and treasury shares distributed under share-based 
compensation  plans  of  € 407 million.  Further  contributing  factors  include  unrealized  net  gains  on  accumulated  other 
comprehensive income, mainly on derivatives hedging cash flows of € 592 million, net of tax, as well as attributable to financial 
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income of € 133 million, net of tax. These were partially offset by negative 
impacts from foreign currency translation of € 1.1 billion, net of tax, primarily resulting from the weakening of the U.S. dollar 
against  the  Euro,  net  purchases  of  treasury  shares  of  € 857 million,  coupons  paid  on  additional  equity  components  of 
€ 498 million  as  well  as  cash  dividends  paid  to  Deutsche  Bank  shareholders  of  € 610 million.  Further  contributing  factors 
include remeasurement losses related to defined benefit plans of € 148 million, net of tax, a net change in share awards for 
the period of € 94 million and cash dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of € 100 million.  

On  February  28,  2023,  Deutsche  Bank  cancelled  26.5 million  of  its  common  shares,  concluding  its  2022  share  buyback 
program. The cancellation reduced the nominal value of the shares by € 68 million. The cancelled shares had been held in 
common shares in treasury, at their acquisition cost of € 300 million. The difference between the common shares at cost and 
their nominal value has reduced additional paid-in capital by € 232 million. The shares had already been deducted from the 
reported total equity on December 31, 2022. Therefore, the cancellation did not reduce the reported total equity in 2023. 

On July 25, 2023, the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG decided to initiate the 2023 share buyback program of up to 
€ 450 million. The share buyback program started on August 2, 2023 and ended on December 8, 2023. In this period Deutsche 
Bank repurchased 45.5 million common shares. The repurchase of these shares has reduced the reported  total equity by 
€ 450 million as of December 31, 2023. 

Own Funds 

Deutsche Bank’s CRR/CRD Common Equity Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2023 remains materially flat at € 48.1 billion, 
compared  to  December  31,  2022.  The  Risk-weighted  assets  (RWA)  decreased  by  € 10.3 billion  to  € 349.7 billion  as  of 
December 31, 2023, compared to € 360.0 billion as of December 31, 2022. The CET 1 capital ratio increased to 13.7% on 
December 31, 2023, from 13.4% on December 31, 2022, as a result of a decrease in RWA. 

The Bank’s Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2023, amounted to € 56.4 billion, consisting of a CET 1 capital of € 48.1 billion 
and Additional Tier 1 capital of € 8.3 billion. The Tier 1 capital was € 0.2 billion lower than at the end of 2022, driven by a 
decrease in AT1 capital. The Tier 1 capital ratio as of December 31, 2023, increased to 16.1% compared to 15.7% as of 
December 31, 2022. 

Total capital as of December 31, 2023 amounted to € 65.0 billion compared to € 66.1 billion at the end of 2022. The Total 
capital decrease was driven by a decrease in Tier 1 capital of € 0.2 billion and a decrease in Tier 2 capital of € 0.9 billion since 
year end 2022. The Total capital ratio as of December 31, 2023, increased to 18.6% compared to 18.4% as of December 31, 
2022.

Moody’s, Fitch and Morningstar DBRS are established in the European Union and have been registered in accordance with 
Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of September 16, 2009, as amended, on credit 
rating agencies (“CRA Regulation”). With respect to S&P, the credit ratings are endorsed by S&P’s office in Ireland (S&P 
Global Ratings Europe Limited) in accordance with Article 4(3) of the CRA Regulation. 

Credit Ratings Development 

The  rating  agencies  recognized  the  continued  progress  the  bank  has  made  over  the  course  of  2023,  specifically  further 
improvements in profitability. This was reflected in upgrades by S&P, Fitch and Morningstar DBRS during the year. 

On May 17, 2023, S&P revised its outlook on Deutsche Bank’s long-term Issuer Credit Rating to positive from stable. S&P 
reflected the bank’s strengthening resilience and performance. In their view, Deutsche Bank’s transformation program has 
established  a  more  focused  and  profitable  business  model  and  laid  the  foundations  for further progress.  In  addition,  S&P 
pointed to the bank’s solid capital, funding, and liquidity profiles underpinning its credit profile and mitigating market volatility. 

On  June  29,  2023,  Morningstar  DBRS  upgraded  Deutsche  Bank’s  long-term  ratings  by  one  notch.  The  bank’s  long-term 
deposit and long-term senior debt ratings as well as the Issuer Rating and the Intrinsic Assessment have been upgraded to A 
from A (low). In addition, the bank’s senior non-preferred debt ratings were raised to A (low) from BBB (high) as well as its 
Critical Obligations Rating to AA (low) from A (high). The outlook on all long-term ratings has been changed to stable from 
positive.  Morningstar  DBRS  highlighted  the  successful  implementation  of  the  strategic  transformation  program,  which  has 
helped stabilize and grow Deutsche Bank’s franchise, together with improved profitability. At the same time, the bank has 
maintained  a  conservative  risk  profile  and  solid  capital  ratios,  in  their  view.  Given  the  business  momentum,  the  ongoing 
repricing of its loan portfolio to higher rates and the cost controls implemented, Morningstar DBRS expects Deutsche Bank to 
be able to maintain profitability levels in line with its rating. 

On July 3, 2023, Fitch upgraded Deutsche Bank’s long-term ratings by one notch. The bank’s long-term deposit and long-
term senior preferred debt ratings as well as the Derivative Counterparty Rating have been upgraded to A from A-. In addition, 
the bank’s Issuer Default Rating and senior non-preferred debt ratings were raised to A- from BBB+. The ratings for Additional 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 debt were upgraded to BB+ from BB and to BBB from BBB-, respectively. The short-term ratings for deposits 
and senior preferred debt were raised to F1 from F2, respectively. The outlook on the long-term Issuer Default Rating has 
been changed to stable from positive. Fitch highlighted the completion of most of its restructuring as well as Deutsche Bank’s 
more stable and diversified business model. In addition, the bank’s sound risk appetite, asset quality,  funding and liquidity 
also support the ratings, in their view. 

Following the outlook revision to positive in May, S&P upgraded Deutsche Bank’s long-term and short-term ratings by one 
notch on December 8, 2023. The bank’s long-term Issuer Credit Rating and the long-term senior preferred debt rating have 
been upgraded to A from A-, while the senior non-preferred debt rating has been increased to BBB from BBB-. In addition, the 
ratings for Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 debt have been upgraded to BBB- from BB+ and to BB from BB-, respectively. The 
short-term  Issuer  Credit  Rating  was  raised  to  A-1  from  A-2.  The  outlook  on  the  long-term  Issuer  Credit  Rating  has  been 
changed to stable from positive. S&P highlighted Deutsche Bank’s strengthened performance and resilience as key drivers of 
the upgrade, while they also believe the bank’s capitalization is supportive to the ratings.

Liquidity and capital resources 

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades  

Deutsche Bank calculates both the contractual and hypothetical potential impact of a one-notch and two-notch downgrade by 
the rating agencies (Moody’s, S&P and Fitch) on its liquidity position and includes this impact in its daily liquidity stress test 
and Liquidity Coverage Ratio calculations. The LCR and liquidity stress test results by scenario are disclosed separately. 

In terms of contractual obligations, the hypothetical impact on derivative liquidity stress outflows of a one-notch downgrade 
across the three rating agencies Moody’s, S&P and Fitch amounts to approximately € 0.4 billion, mainly driven by increased 
contractual derivatives funding and/or margin requirements. The hypothetical impact of a two-notch downgrade amounts to 
approximately € 0.5 billion, mainly driven by increased contractual derivatives funding and/or margin requirements. 

The above analysis assumes a simultaneous downgrade by the three rating agencies Moody’s, S&P and Fitch that would 
consequently reduce Deutsche Bank’s funding capacity in the stated amounts. This specific contractual analysis feeds into 
the bank’s idiosyncratic liquidity stress test scenario. 

The actual impact of a downgrade to Deutsche Bank is unpredictable and may differ from potential funding and liquidity impacts 
described above.

agencies can change their ratings at any time if they believe that circumstances so warrant. The long-term credit ratings should 
not be viewed as recommendations to buy, hold or sell Deutsche Bank’s securities.

Outlook 

Outlook  

The following section provides an overview of Deutsche Bank’s outlook for the Group and business divisions for the financial 
year 2024. The  outlook  for the  global  economy  and  banking  industry  in  the  following  chapter reflects  the  Group’s  general 
expectations regarding future economic and industry developments. Economic assumptions used in the bank’s models are 
laid out separately in the respective sections.

The Global Economy Outlook 

2024² 

2023 

  Main driver 
  Global economic growth is expected to slow somewhat in 2024. Lagged effects of the monetary 
policy tightening are likely to be a drag for the developed market economies at least until mid-
year 2024. Noticeably positive contributions to global growth are expected to come mainly from 
emerging markets. The weaker global economy is likely to support a further easing of inflation

  In the developed economies, growth is likely to be weakened in particular by the weak momentum 
in the eurozone. A noticeable slowdown in inflation should support households' real incomes and 
thus  limit  the  economic  downturn.  Lower  inflation  rates  should  enable  central  banks  to  start 
lowering key interest rates from the middle of the 2024 

4.2   
8.4 

  Growth in the emerging markets is expected to be somewhat weaker in 2024, with developments 
in  the  individual  regions  likely  to  vary  considerably.  However,  most  countries  should  see  a 
significant  easing  of  inflation.  The  expected  weak  growth  in  industrialized  countries  will  be  a 
headwind for foreign trade, although this is likely to vary from region to region 

0.5   
5.4 

(0.3)   
6.0 

  GDP growth in the eurozone is likely to stagnate until the middle of the year. After that, private 
consumption should provide stronger support for the economy if inflation continues to significantly 
drop. The ECB is expected to start lowering key interest rates from the first half of 2024. Inflation 
could reach the target rate of 2% by mid-year. 
German GDP is expected to shrink again in 2024. Fiscal policy is likely to become tighter because 
of a ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court. If rising wages and easing inflation support private 
consumption,  the  economy  is  expected  to  regain  momentum  in  the  summer.  The  somewhat 
weaker global economy is likely to limit the recovery. The still tight monetary policy will provide 
an additional headwind 

  The U.S. economy is likely to grow robustly, despite the lagged impact of previous interest rate 
hikes and lower wage growth. If the labour market and inflation continue to weaken, the Fed could 
start to cut interest rates from the middle of the year 

2.5   
4.1   

2.0   
3.3 

  The growth rate of the Japanese economy is expected to slow, not least due to head winds from 
the slowdown overseas and fiscal policy to gradually become less accommodative. Wage growth 
is likely to be strong in 2024 and support private consumption. Due to steady inflation and wage 
growth, the Bank of Japan is expected to end its negative interest rate policy in 2024 

  China's development remains of crucial importance for the Asian economies. The slowdown in 
growth overseas is a headwind for the region. The easing of inflation is likely to come to an end 
in 2024. When the US central bank starts cutting interest rates, the Asian central banks could also 
start easing 
Further fiscal and monetary policy support may be necessary in 2024 to achieve the government's 
growth target. The expected weak growth in Europe is likely to be a headwind for China's export 
economy. The weak property market is dampening demand from private households

There are a number of risks to the bank’s global economic outlook. Geopolitical risks remain elevated in Ukraine and in the 
Middle East. The U.S. versus China strategic competition could possibly continue to intensify. The potential intensification of 
interdependencies between crisis hotspots could exacerbate the impact on the markets. In 2024, important elections will take 
place  in  many  regions  of  the  world,  including  the  U.S.  and  the  EU,  and  the  news  surrounding  these  could  well  have  the 
potential to move the markets, at least in the short term.

Annual Report 2023 

Outlook 

Banking industry 

The global banking industry will probably face more headwinds in 2024 than in the past year when the operating environment 
had been quite benign. Interest rates are likely to have peaked in major economies and could start to fall from spring onwards. 
This may exert pressure on net interest margins in the medium term despite a potential short-term benefit from lower funding 
cost. Asset quality might deteriorate somewhat from current levels as significantly higher interest rates continue to creep into 
the private sector and stretched borrowers face increasing refinancing risks, especially in the commercial real estate markets. 
At the same time, a slow real economy in advanced countries may result in credit demand of companies and households 
weakening further until it stabilizes over the course of the year; with loan volumes possibly moderately contracting. Momentum 
in capital markets could see a cyclical improvement following two years of suppressed activity. 

European banks may continue to benefit from substantially higher interest rates, although the associated side effects will gain 
in weight. As a result of considerable uncertainty about the speed and extent of the disinflation process, timing and size of the 
ECB’s initial rate cuts is also subject to changing expectations. Likewise, fiscal and economic policy uncertainty may increase 
due to the incoming new European Commission and European Parliament, on top of developments in individual EU member 
states  and  looming  further  geopolitical  fragmentation.  However,  the  banking  industry  should  continue  to  operate  from  a 
position of strength, with revenues still strong despite slower growth and bottom-line profitability likely to remain close to current 
record high levels. Capital ratios might edge up slightly, while the specific impact of the implementation of the Final Basel III 
reforms in the EU should become clear. However additional improvements in profitability and capital may become harder to 
achieve. 

In the US, the economy may continue to expand robustly in 2024, which may support loan growth. While the Fed is likely to 
proceed more slowly in cutting interest rates than the ECB, lower rates could nevertheless help ease the burden of unrealized 
securities  losses  on  banks’  balance  sheets.  Similar  to  Europe,  policy  uncertainty  could increase  ahead  of US  elections  in 
November.  But  greater clarity is  emerging  regarding  the  implementation  of  the  Final  Basel  III  reforms  and  specifically  the 
tighter requirements regional banks will face as a consequence of the turmoil in March 2023. This could slow their growth and 
make  building  up  capital  as  well  as  strengthening  liquidity  a  priority.  Nevertheless,  system-wide  profitability  should  stay 
elevated. 

Banks in China and Japan may continue to experience headwinds from lackluster economic growth and low, respectively 
zero, interest rates, even though a first rate hike in Japan is expected in spring. Chinese banks in particular are likely to be 
affected by the ongoing crisis in the domestic real estate market. Nevertheless, exact repercussions are difficult to predict 
given the strong role the authorities might potentially play in resolving any issues. 

In 2024, the European Commission, European Parliament and the European member states will focus on closing as many of 
the pending legislative files as possible, ahead of the elections of the European Parliament in June 2024 and the appointment 
of the new European Commission in October 2024. Files that are open include the Listings Act, Retail Investment Strategy, 
the  digital  euro,  open  finance,  Corporate  Sustainability  Due  Diligence  Directive,  the  review  of  the  Payment  Services 
framework,  the  review  of  the  European  Markets  Infrastructure  framework  (EMIR  3.0),  Benchmarks  Regulation,  and  the 
extension for third-country benchmarks from the EU Benchmarks Regulation to December 2025.  

In the U.S., most of the attention is on the proposal from the U.S. agencies to implement the Final Basel III package in the 
U.S. framework. The proposal raises capital requirements for banks over U.S.$ 100 billion in assets and removes much of the 
differentiation among institutions’ requirements, those that are not U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks, based on size 
and complexity.

8  In respect of financial year 2024 onwards 

Deutsche Bank reaffirms its financial targets to be achieved by 2025 of a post-tax return on average tangible equity of above 
10% and increases the bank’s target on compound annual revenue growth of between 5.5% and 6.5% for 2021 to 2025, from 
its previously announced 3.5 to 4.5% target, along with a cost/income ratio of below 62.5%. The bank also confirms its capital 
objectives of a CET 1 capital ratio of around 13% and a payout ratio of 50% in respect of the financial year 2024 onwards. All 
forward-looking projections below are based on January 31, 2024, foreign exchange rates. 

In  2024, Deutsche Bank  revenues  are expected to  be  slightly  higher compared  to  the  prior  year.  Deutsche Bank  expects 
revenues to be at around € 30 billion at Group level supported by the resilience and growth potential of its businesses and 
continued business momentum. Corporate Bank revenues are expected to be slightly lower in 2024 driven by an continued 
normalization of net interest margins. Investment Bank revenues are expected to be higher in 2024 driven by significantly 
higher revenues in Origination & Advisory mainly from an expected recovery in the Debt Origination business and slightly 
higher revenues in FIC Sales & Trading. Private Bank net revenues are expected to remain essentially flat, benefiting from 
the business growth in investment products, which are partially offset by lower deposit revenues given a more competitive 
environment. In Asset Management, revenues are expected to be slightly higher assuming market stabilization.  

Deutsche  Bank  is  managing  the  Group’s  cost  base  towards  the  2025  cost/income  ratio  target.  The  bank  remains  highly 
focused on cost discipline and delivery of the initiatives underway and expects noninterest expenses as well as adjusted costs 
in 2024 to be essentially flat compared to 2023. The Group believes costs in 2024 to benefit from the bank’s investment in 
structural  efficiency  measures.  These  include  the  optimization  of  the  Germany  platform,  the  upgrade  of  technology 
architecture, the front-to-back redesign of processes and measures to increase infrastructure efficiency. These effects are 
expected to counterbalance continued inflationary headwinds and help funding selected investments in business growth and 
in the control environment. The bank aims for a quarterly run-rate of adjusted costs of € 5 billion in 2024 and aims to operate 
with total noninterest expenses of around € 20 billion in 2025. 

Given the headwinds in the first quarter of 2024, the Group’s guidance for the full year 2024 provision for  credit losses is 
expected  to  be  at  the  upper  end  of  25  to  30  basis  points  of  average  loans  in  light  of  the  persistent  macro-economic  and 
geopolitical uncertainties. Deutsche Bank remains committed to stringent underwriting standards and a tight risk management 
framework. Further details on the calculation of expected credit losses are provided in the section “Management Report: Risk 
Report”.

Annual Report 2023 

Outlook 
Deutsche Bank Group 

Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET 1 ratio) by year end 2024 is expected to remain essentially flat compared to 2023. The bank 
has  received  the  majority  of  the  regulatory decisions  for internal  credit and  market  risk  models  in  2023  with  smaller ones 
expected in 2024. On a net basis, risk weighted assets are expected to be slightly higher from capital efficient business growth. 
Starting  in  2024,  Deutsche  Bank  introduces  a  new  methodology  regarding  the  allocation  of  operational  risk  RWA  to  the 
divisions, while the Group’s operational risk RWA will be unaffected by the change, the respective divisional metrics will change 
going forward. Deutsche Bank aims to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of around 13%, i.e., to operate with a 
buffer of 200 basis point above the bank’s expected maximum distributable amount (MDA) threshold, also after the impacts 
from the adoption of CRR 3, which is expected to become effective on January 1, 2025. 

Deutsche  Bank  plans  to  sustainably  grow  cash  dividends  and,  over  time,  return  to  shareholders  through  share  buybacks 
excess  capital  over  and  above  the  requirements  to  support  profitable  growth  and  upcoming  regulatory  changes.  For  the 
financial year 2023, the Management Board intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of € 0.45 per share, 
after having  paid  a  dividend  of  € 0.30  per share for 2022  and  € 0.20  per share for 2021.  For  the  financial  year 2024  and 
subsequent years, the bank targets a payout ratio of 50% of net income attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders, delivered 
through a combination of cash dividends and share buybacks. These distributions to shareholders are subject to shareholder 
authorization and German corporate law requirements, and in the case of share buybacks additionally require prior regulatory 
approval. Deutsche Bank plans to increase both share repurchases and dividends by at least 50% year on year in 2024. The 
bank has received supervisory approval for a share repurchase of € 675 million, which it aims materially to complete in the 
first  half  of  2024,  having  completed  € 450 million  in  share  repurchases  in  2023;  and  Deutsche  Bank  plans  to  propose  a 
dividend in respect of the 2023 financial year of € 0.45 per share, or approximately € 900 million, up from € 0.30 per share for 
2022, at the bank’s Annual General Meeting in May 2024. For the financial years 2024 and 2025, Deutsche Bank aims for 
cash dividends of € 0.68 and € 1.00 per share, respectively, subject to a 50% payout ratio limitation relative to net income 
attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders. The bank has set a capital distribution goal of € 8 billion in respect of the financial 
years 2021-2025, paid in 2022-2026, and believes that it is positioned to exceed this objective based on the achievement of 
the bank’s financial targets. 

By  the  nature  of  the  bank’s  business,  Deutsche  Bank  is  involved  in  litigation,  arbitration  and  regulatory  proceedings  and 
investigations in Germany and in a number of jurisdictions outside Germany, including in the United States. Such matters are 
subject to many uncertainties. While Deutsche Bank resolved a number of important litigation matters and made progress on 
others, the bank expects the litigation and enforcement environment to remain challenging. For 2024, and with a caveat that 
forecasting  litigation  charges  is  subject  to  many  uncertainties,  Deutsche  Bank  presently  expects  net  litigation  charges  to 
exceed the levels experienced in 2023. For more details, please refer to “Provisions” of this report. 

Deutsche  Bank’s  aspirations  are  subject  to  various  external  and  internal  risks,  some  of  which  the  bank  cannot  influence. 
Timely and successful achievement of its strategic targets or aspirations may be adversely impacted by reduced revenue-
generating capacities of some of the bank’s core businesses should downside risks crystallize. These risks include but are 
not limited to the uncertain future path of inflation and central bank’s policies on interest rates, the Israel-Hamas war and the 
war in Ukraine with both having escalation potential, a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, elevated geopolitical risks, 
plausible cyber events, the ongoing headwinds posed by regulatory reforms and the effects on the bank’s legal and regulatory 
proceedings.  A  key  focus  in  2023  was  the  persistently  high  inflation  which  drove  further  monetary  tightening,  growing 
expectations of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment and generally tighter financial conditions in the major advanced 
economies. Towards the end of 2023, evidence of waning inflation pressure led to a repricing of market expectations with 
respect to earlier and more significant central bank rate cuts in 2024 accompanied by an easing of financial conditions. In 
addition, there were episodes of significant market volatility particularly around selective failures and/or restructurings in the 
U.S. and European banking sector as well as increasing pressure on the commercial real estate market, particularly in the 
U.S. office sector. Overall, these trends could continue to drive high levels of uncertainty and could result in fluctuations in the 
results  of  Deutsche  Bank’s  operations,  strategic  plans  and  financial  targets.  For  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  potential 
downside risks please refer to Risks in “Risks and opportunities” of this report. 

Adjusted costs as well as Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to

Outlook 
Deutsche Bank Business segments 

Deutsche Bank Business segments 

Corporate Bank 

Corporate Bank revenues are expected to be slightly lower in 2024 compared to the prior year. Revenue performance in 2023 
was  marked  by  extraordinary  high  levels  of  net  interest  income,  principally  in  deposit-based  businesses,  resulting  from 
increased interest rates and strict pricing discipline. Corporate Bank anticipates a normalization of deposit revenues in 2024, 
which is expected to be partially offset by growing noninterest rate sensitive revenue streams, including commissions and 
fees. Despite being slightly lower compared to 2023, revenues are expected to be significantly higher than during the  low 
interest rate environment. 

Corporate Treasury Services revenues are anticipated to be slightly lower due the normalization of rate pass-through in the 
Corporate Cash Management business, partially offset by growth in structured and flow trade finance solutions and lending. 
Institutional Client Services revenues are also expected to be slightly lower driven by a reduction in net interest income, partly 
offset by slightly higher fee income. In Business Banking, revenues are expected to be essentially flat compared to prior year, 
driven by business growth with stable interest income and lagging deposit payouts. 

Provision for credit losses is expected to be in a range of 20 to 25 basis points of average loans in 2024. 

Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs are expected to be slightly higher in 2024 compared to 2023, as a result of higher 
internal service cost allocations.  

RWA in the Corporate Bank are anticipated to be higher in 2024 driven by increased lending activities, changes from the 
aforementioned new methodology regarding the allocation of operational risk RWA to the divisions and model changes.  

In  addition  to  the  risks  already  outlined  above,  risks  to  the  division’s  outlook  include  lower  economic  growth  in  the  major 
operating countries from ongoing supply chain disruptions, higher energy and commodity prices as well as uncertainty around 
central bank policies (e.g., the interest rate environment). In addition, ongoing regulatory developments (e.g., the finalization 
of the Basel III framework) and lower levels of client activity may also have an adverse impact. 

Investment Bank 

Investment Bank revenues are expected to be higher in 2024 compared to the prior year. In 2024, the division expects the 
targeted investments made in both FIC Sales & Trading and Origination & Advisory in the prior year, combined with a broader 
recovery in Origination & Advisory market to drive improved performance. 

FIC Sales & Trading revenues are expected to be slightly higher compared to 2023. Rates plans to consolidate its existing 
position, while selectively growing via targeted investments in line with client demand and market opportunities. The Foreign 
Exchange business will look to further technology development in spot and expand its precious metals offering. The Global 
Emerging Markets business will continue to further develop its onshore capabilities, for example building on the development 
of Latin America and client workflow solutions globally, while selectively expanding its product offering. Credit Trading intends 
to build on the turnaround in performance seen in the flow business in 2023. The Financing business will continue to optimize 
the effective deployment of resources and look to maintain our top 3 ranking globally. 

Origination & Advisory revenues are expected to be significantly higher in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by an expected 
industry recovery and the impact of investments made in the prior year, with the acquisition of Numis bringing benefits across 
the business. Within Debt Origination the business expects Leveraged Debt Capital Markets to build on the partial recovery it 
witnessed in the prior year, while Investment Grade Debt will look to maintain its robust performance in 2023 and benefit from 
an expected improvement in the industry fee pool in 2024. Equity Origination will continue to provide a competitive offering 
across products,  with  a  specific  focus  on  IPOs.  Advisory plans  to  build  on  the  momentum  of  targeted  investment  in  2023 
including the Numis acquisition, which will materially expand the businesses UK client base.  

Provision for credit losses in 2024 are expected to be in a range of 35 to 40 basis points of average loans. Overall provisioning 
levels are likely to remain elevated, as macroeconomic factors that have caused these levels are expected to continue this 
year.

Annual Report 2023 

Outlook 
Deutsche Bank Business segments 

In  2024,  noninterest  expenses  are  expected  to  be  essentially  flat  compared  to  the  previous  year.  Non-recurring  goodwill 
impairment, significantly lower Bank levy charges and lower litigation settlements in 2024 are expected to be offset by a full 
year of costs associated with the strategic growth initiatives, along with further people and technology investments, continued 
inflation and increased regulatory related costs within infrastructure support. 

For 2024, RWA in the Investment Bank is expected to be essentially flat compared to 2023. Increased Credit Risk RWA to 
support revenue growth is offset by lower allocated operational risk RWA and model changes. 

In addition to the risks outlined for the Group above, risks to the outlook of the Investment Bank in 2024 include potential 
impacts on the business model from macroeconomic changes, including uncertainties associated with the ongoing conflicts 
in Europe and the Middle East, while second order effects on energy, supply chain disruptions and food prices will continue 
to have a significant impact on financial markets. Central bank policies, specifically around interest rates and expected fiscal 
loosening  could  create  further  risks.  In  addition,  the  evolving  regulatory  framework  could  lead  to  unforeseen  regulatory 
compliance  costs  and  possible  delays  in  the  implementation  of  the  division’s  efficiency  measures,  which  could  adversely 
impact its cost base. 

Private Bank 

In 2024, the Private Bank expects net revenues to remain essentially flat compared to 2023. Growth in investment product 
revenues, supported by continued net inflows in assets under management driven by continued business growth, is expected 
to be partially offset by a decline in deposit revenues given a more competitive market environment.  

In  the  Private  Bank  Germany,  net  revenues  are  expected  to  be  essentially  flat  compared  to  2023.  Deposit  revenues  are 
expected to decrease due to the higher competition as well as lending due to continued elevated interest rate environment, 
while investment products are expected to grow. In the International Private Bank, net revenues are expected to be essentially 
flat year on year driven by increased investment product revenues reflecting continued business growth, partially offset by a 
decline in deposit revenues, while lending revenues remain essentially flat. 

Private Bank assumes continued growth in assets under management in 2024 with corresponding volumes expected to be 
higher compared to year-end 2023. The overall development of volumes though will highly depend on market parameters, 
including equity indices and foreign exchange rates. 

In 2024, provision for credit losses is expected to be in a range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. 2023 included a 
small number of single name losses in the International Private Bank and higher provision for credit losses from temporary 
operational backlog in the second half of 2023 in Private Bank Germany. 

Noninterest expenses are expected to be slightly lower in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by significantly lower nonoperating 
costs. Adjusted costs are expected to be slightly lower year on year reflecting continued savings from strategic initiatives, 
including slightly lower headcount as well as internal service cost allocations. This will be partially offset by continued inflation 
impacts. 

RWA  are  expected  to  be  higher  in  2024  mainly  driven  by  the  reallocation  of  operational  risk  RWA  and  model  changes, 
regulatory inflation, and loan related RWA increases. 

In addition to the risks outlined for the Group above, risks to Private Bank’s outlook include global inflationary pressures due 
to  higher  energy  and  commodity  prices  as  well  as  ongoing  supply  chain  disruptions,  uncertainty  on  interest  rates,  slower 
economic  growth  in  the  major  operating  countries  and  lower  client  activity.  Client  activity  could  be  impacted  by  market 
uncertainties  including  higher  than  expected  volatility  in  equity  and  credit  markets.  The  implementation  of  regulatory 
requirements, delays in the implementation of strategic projects, delays in Postbank service remediation or changes resulting 
from contract renegotiations could also have a negative impact on revenues, capital consumption and costs.

Outlook 
Deutsche Bank Business segments 

Asset Management 

The Asset Management segment principally consists of the consolidated financial results of DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA, 
of which Deutsche Bank AG owns a controlling interest. 

Given the current macroeconomic outlook and the asset management industry’s challenges, Asset Management intends to 
focus on innovative products and services where it can differentiate and best serve clients, while also maintaining a disciplined 
cost approach as it invests in growth and transformation. Asset Management also continues to expect its diversified asset 
base to provide some protection against current challenges. 

Asset Management expects net revenues to be slightly higher for the full year 2024 compared to 2023. Management fees are 
expected to remain essentially flat as slightly higher fees from flows and market impacts are expected to be counterbalanced 
by anticipated industry wide margin compression. Performance and transaction fees are expected to be lower in 2024 and 
other revenues to be significantly higher from improved investment income and lower funding allocations.  

Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs are expected to be essentially flat in 2024 compared to 2023, as the division expects 
to continue investing into growth and platform transformation.  

Asset Management expects assets under management to be slightly higher at the end of 2024 compared to the end of 2023, 
with continued net inflows into growth areas like Passive including Xtrackers. Net flows should be further enhanced by strategic 
partnerships and product innovations. 

RWA are expected to be higher in 2024, mainly driven by the reallocation of operational risk RWA and from model changes. 

In addition to the risks described above for the Group, risks to Asset Management’s outlook include protectionist and anti-
trade policies, that could have unpredictable consequences in the economy, market volatility and investors’ confidence, which 
may lead to declines in business and could affect revenues and profits. In addition, the evolving regulatory framework could 
lead to unforeseen regulatory compliance costs and possible delays in the implementation of the efficiency measures, which 
could adversely impact the division’s cost base. 

Corporate & Other  

Corporate  &  Other  is  expected  to  generate  a  pre-tax  loss  in  2024.  Corporate  &  Other  will  continue  to  retain  shareholder 
expenses, which are expected to be around € 0.6 billion for the full year 2024 as well as certain funding and liquidity impacts, 
which  are expected  to  be  around  € 0.2 billion  for full  year  2024. Corporate  &  Other will  continue  to  record  the  reversal  of 
noncontrolling interests reported in the business segments, primarily from DWS.  

Legacy  portfolios  are  expected  to  generate  a  larger  pre-tax  loss  in  2024,  primarily  from  the  non-recurrence  of  a  litigation 
provision release recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, results in Corporate & Other will continue to be impacted 
by  valuation  and  timing  differences  on  positions  that  are  economically  hedged,  but  do  not  meet  hedge  accounting 
requirements.  

RWA are expected to be significantly lower in 2024, mainly driven by the reallocation of operational risk RWA and model 
changes.

Risks and Opportunities 

The  following  section  focuses  on  future  trends  or  events  that  may  result  in  downside  risk  or  upside  potential  from  what 
Deutsche Bank has anticipated in its “Outlook”. 

The Group’s aspirations are subject to various external and internal factors, some of which it cannot influence. Timely and 
successful  achievement  of  its  strategic  targets  or  aspirations  including  containing  costs  at  the  expected  run  rate,  may  be 
adversely impacted by reduced revenue-generating capacities of some of the bank’s core businesses should downside risks 
crystallize. These risks include but are not limited to the uncertain future path of inflation and central bank’s policies on interest 
rates, the Israel-Hamas conflict and the war in Ukraine with both having escalation potential, a deteriorating macroeconomic 
environment, elevated geopolitical risks, cyber events, the ongoing headwinds posed by regulatory reforms and the effects on 
the  bank’s  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings.  A  key  focus  in  2023  was  the  persistently  high  inflation  which  drove  further 
monetary tightening, risks of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment and generally tighter financial conditions in the major 
advanced  economies.  Towards  the  end  of  the  year,  evidence  of  waning  inflation  pressure  led  to  a  repricing  of  market 
expectations with respect to earlier and more significant central bank rate cuts in 2024 accompanied by an easing of financial 
conditions.  In  addition,  there  were  episodes  of  significant  market  volatility  particularly  around  selective  failures  and/or 
restructurings in the U.S. and European banking sector as well as increasing pressure on the CRE market, particularly in the 
U.S. office sector. Overall, these trends could continue to drive high levels of uncertainty and could result in fluctuations in the 
results of the Group’s operations, strategic plans and financial targets. 

Opportunities may arise if macroeconomic conditions, the inflation and interest rate environment improve beyond currently 
forecasted levels, leading to higher revenues and improving the Group’s ability to meet its financial targets. Currently, macro-
financial forecasts feature a “soft landing” of most advanced economies (with short episodes of a mild recession or stagnation), 
only moderate increases in unemployment, lower inflation rates and a significant easing of monetary policy by major central 
banks in 2024. At the same time, potentially higher inflation and interest rate levels and market volatility could lead to increased 
revenues from trading flows and higher net interest income and lending margins. Through times of volatility or uncertainty, 
Deutsche Bank could also benefit from helping clients navigate such financial markets. Focusing on and investing in Deutsche 
Bank’s areas of core strengths and the implementation of its strategy may create further opportunities if implemented to a 
greater extent or under more favorable conditions than currently anticipated. 

Risks 

Macroeconomic and market conditions 

In  2023,  several  U.S.  regional  banks  and  one  major  European  bank  either  failed  or  were  restructured  leading  to  investor 
concerns over the wider banking sector. While overall fundamentals remained sound, as indicated by the 2023 U.S. CCAR 
and EU-wide EBA stress tests, and market volatility has subsequently reduced, these events in certain areas have increased 
the likelihood of a tightening of financial conditions as banks act to preserve liquidity amid higher competition for deposits and 
increased depositor sensitivity around concentration risks and unrealized losses on rates sensitive exposures. A pronounced 
tightening  in  financial  conditions  would  lead  to  more  stringent  lending  standards,  higher  client  refinancing  risks,  with 
Commercial Real Estate and higher leveraged corporate clients among the sectors with increased risk. 

Major central banks likely reached the peak of the policy rate cycle in 2023. Headline inflation and  - more  recently - core 
inflation have shown clearer signs of progress in decelerating towards central bank targets. Financial markets have started to 
anticipate significant rate cuts for 2024 which has supported a significant easing of financial conditions with lower bond yields, 
higher equities and tighter credit spreads. However, the path of monetary policy normalization remains somewhat uncertain 
with central banks signaling that market expectations of early rate cuts in 2024 may be too optimistic in light of remaining 
inflation risks.

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Risks and Opportunities 
Risks 

The lagged effects from tighter monetary policy could lead to refinancing risks and potential downgrades across the bank’s 
client franchise while corporate default rates could continue to rise in 2024. The risk of idiosyncratic defaults also remains 
high. In addition, inflation, interest rates and market volatility could lead to significant collateral value reductions with risks 
related to recoveries in case of liquidation and therefore higher impacts on provisions for credit losses. This is particularly 
relevant in instances where financing is asset based and without recourse to a third party. As the lagged effects of higher rates 
and quantitative tightening feed through to the real economy, further liquidity events may crystallize. The bank could therefore 
experience higher than expected provisions for credit losses and elevated interest rates may adversely affect Deutsche Bank’s 
planned  results  of  operations, financial  targets  and  costs;  which  may result  in  rating  downgrades  across the  bank’s client 
franchise leading to credit risk RWA inflation. More persistent inflation and higher terminal interest rates could increase clients’ 
reallocation of savings to higher interest paying fixed deposits and dampen consumer spending and private client investments 
which could lead to a reduction in new lending for consumer finance and/or private mortgages. Furthermore, higher costs of 
living for private individuals as result of a more persistent inflationary environment could negatively affect their ability to repay 
credit obligations and consequently could lead to higher provisions for credit losses particularly in consumer finance. 

CRE markets remain under stress from the impact of high interest rates and borrowing costs, tight lending conditions and 
economic headwinds. Decreasing liquidity and price discovery for CRE have resulted in a pronounced decline in transactions 
and willingness to extend lending, particularly in the U.S. office market, with risks compounded by post-pandemic shifts in 
working  patterns.  The  distressed  situation  in  the  CRE  markets  impacts  collateral  values  and  consequently  loan-to-values, 
particularly in the office sector, and may result in higher than expected provision in credit losses.  

The U.S. economy remained resilient in 2023, performing in line with a soft-landing scenario, with the labor market softening 
gradually  and  inflation  pressures  receding.  Consensus  GDP  growth  forecasts  for  2023  and  2024  have  continuously  been 
revised upwards. Economic downside risks remain though, mainly due to the lagged impact of monetary tightening. The same 
holds  for  the  Eurozone  economy  where  economic  activity  remains  weak,  particularly  in  manufacturing,  and  country 
performance is divergent with Germany underperforming as the energy-induced competitiveness shock and other structural 
factors continue to weigh on the economy. Economic growth is projected to recover only slowly in 2024. External downside 
risks stem not only from the U.S. and Europe but also from China’s economy where domestic activity lacks momentum and 
the highly indebted real estate sector is yet to show signs of a turn around.  

Overall, either in isolation or in combination with other risk factors such as an escalation of the China/Taiwan tensions and the 
political risks associated with the 2024 U.S. election, the aforementioned risks could lead to a deterioration in Deutsche Bank’s 
portfolio quality and higher than expected credit and market losses. This could also lead to rating declines among clients, 
leading to increasing provisioning levels as well as increased numbers of clients drawing down on credit facilities which would 
lead to higher capital requirements and liquidity demands. There would also be a higher risk of idiosyncratic defaults. Higher 
volatility in financial markets could lead to increased margin calls, higher market risk RWA and elevated valuation reserves. 
Negative impacts on investor appetite may also impact the Group’s ability to distribute and de-risk capital market commitments, 
which could potentially result in losses as well as making pricing and hedging more challenging and costly. Volatility in capital 
markets also increases the risk of idiosyncratic counterparty events both directly and indirectly, for example shortfalls under 
Lombard or securities financing transactions. 

The aforementioned developments can also impact Deutsche Bank’s revenue generating capabilities and costs, while market 
declines and volatility could negatively impact the value of financial instruments, drive volatility in the bank’s valuation and 
timing differences and result in impairments of non-financial assets. This is particularly relevant as a decline in financial market 
liquidity would exacerbate price volatility and the risk of broader market stress. Market volatility, which can be also triggered 
by  unexpected  policy  decisions  or  policy  mistakes,  and  the  challenging  macro  environment  could  also  lead  to  increased 
inherent risks in several non-financial risks including transaction processing, internal and external fraud and conduct risks 
including attempts to conceal losses and increased litigation attempts from clients. 

Another focus area is private capital markets which include certain activities from non-bank financial institutions and private 
credit more broadly. The non-bank financial institutions sector is extremely broad with diverse risk profiles and vulnerabilities. 
A failure of one or multiple larger non-bank financial institutions has the potential to drive direct losses for banks including 
Deutsche  Bank  and  other  creditors  /  capital  providers.  Broader  market  instability  with  rising  rates,  risk  aversion,  market 
illiquidity  and  economic  slowdown  all  increase  the  likelihood  of  failures  occurring  as  returns  drop  and  investors  reallocate 
capital.  Internal  risk  management  approaches  are  commensurate  to  the  risk  profile  of  underlying  counterparty  and 
concentration risk exposures and although the bank has not experienced any noteworthy losses in the past, the bank may do 
so in the future.

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Risks and Opportunities 
Risks 

A substantial proportion of the assets and liabilities on the Group’s balance sheet comprise of financial instruments that are 
carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in its income statement. As a result of such changes, the Group 
has incurred losses in the past, and may incur further losses in the future. The Group is exposed to risks related to movements 
from foreign exchange rates, most notably related to the USD and GBP. The bank also accounts for a substantial portion of 
assets and liabilities at amortized costs. The fair value of these assets may be lower than its carrying value and could result 
in realized losses if the asset is sold prior to maturity. 

Similarly, liquidity risk could arise from lower value and marketability of Deutsche Bank’s High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), 
to which the Group during 2023, has transitioned its risk appetite from Liquidity Reserves (as defined in with the Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61). Moreover, Liquidity risk could affect the amount of proceeds available for covering cash 
outflows  during  a  stress  event.  Additional  haircuts  may  be  incurred  on  top  of  already  impaired  asset  values.  Moreover, 
securities might lose their eligibility as collateral necessary for accessing Central Bank facilities, as well as their value in the 
repo/wholesale funding market. At the same time, the Group’s liquidity position may also be impaired in situations where its 
counterparty on e.g., a derivative contract is not current on an obligation to post collateral, in which case the bank has to cover 
for the shortfall through other means. 

The Group is exposed to pension risks which can materially impact the measurement of Deutsche Bank’s pension obligations, 
including interest rate, inflation and longevity risks that can materially impact its earnings.  

If  multiple  downside  risks  simultaneously  materialize  and/or  occur  in  combination  with  a  more  pronounced  economic 
slowdown, the negative impact on Deutsche Bank’s business environment could be more severe than currently expected. 

Geopolitics 

A  number  of  political  and  geopolitical  risks  and  events  could  negatively  affect  Deutsche  Bank’s  business  environment, 
including weaker economic activity, financial market corrections, compliance risks or a lower interest rate level. 

On October 7,  2023, Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, which Israel responded to with a military campaign against Hamas 
forces and infrastructure in Gaza. Although direct risk or impacts to the bank are contained to date and no significant losses 
are currently expected, the key risk relates to the extent of wider escalation within the region. Going forward this may also 
impact oil prices, broader energy markets and global supply chains thereby undermining confidence and global growth. In 
early 2024, this regional escalation has increased including Houthi attacks against cargo vessels in the Red sea. The latter 
already impacting global supply chains, with Asia-to-North Europe freight rates more than doubling. 

Amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine, further sanctions packages have been introduced in 2023. New sanctions, as well as 
countermeasures by the Russian government, increased differences between the local application / implementation of relevant 
requirements by Deutsche Bank’s subsidiaries in Russia and the Deutsche Bank Group, along with increasing operational 
complexity and creating conflict of law situations. Sanctions and Russian countermeasures, including expropriation of assets, 
may  also  complicate  the  wind-down  of  transactions  and  relationships  that  the  bank  may  need  to  exit.  This  regulatory 
environment or other restrictions could result in accounting losses or the loss of control over Deutsche Bank’s subsidiaries or 
assets. Any of these risks could disrupt business and lead to material losses. 

Against  this  backdrop,  the  Russian  government  and  economy  could  further  resort  to  activity  aimed  at  circumventing  the 
sanctions  imposed,  intentionally  or  unwittingly  facilitated  through  economic  operators  in  the  West  or  in  so-called  proxy-
countries which take a neutral position towards the Russian war against Ukraine. It may be challenging for the bank to identify 
such activity and protect the bank against the potential regulatory and reputational impacts of such illicit activity in all cases. 
Against the challenging sanctions backdrop, banks may also be implicated in economic disputes of and with counterparties 
which could result in costs or losses which would not occur in the normal course of business. 

Also, tensions between the U.S. and China remain elevated across a wide range of areas, including trade and technology-
related  issues,  Hong  Kong,  Taiwan,  human  rights,  and  cybersecurity.  While  the  bank  does  not  consider  a  China/Taiwan 
military conflict as its base case in the near-term, potential downside impacts from an escalation are significant and could 
substantially  and  adversely  affect  Deutsche  Bank’s  planned  results  of  operations  and  financial  targets.  The  German 
government  published  its  own  China  strategy  which  envisages  German  companies  to  still  partake  in  China’s  economic 
development whilst also encouraging diversification efforts to  reduce potentially harmful concentration risks and economic 
dependencies  on  China.  Recently,  although  in  connection  with  the  ongoing  war  in  Ukraine,  the  U.S.  sanctioned  several 
Chinese  and  Russian  companies  adding  to  the  tensions  between  the  two  countries.  In  September,  the  EU  Commission 
announced  an  investigation  into  subsidies  to  Chinese  electric  vehicle  exporters  which  could  lead  to  increased  tariffs  and 
possible Chinese trade retaliation measures. Geopolitical tensions could drive further economic polarization and fragmentation 
of global trade with the possible emergence of distinct China vs. US-led blocks. Over the medium to long term, the International 
Monetary Fund among others has highlighted the potential negative impact of deglobalization on living standards and growth.

In  many  democratic  countries,  domestic  political  challenges  have  arisen  from  growing  political  polarization,  rising  social 
discontent  and  higher  inflation.  These  challenges  may  impede  political  decision-making  processes,  forestall  necessary 
structural reforms and lead to negative economic outcomes which could directly or indirectly impact the bank’s risk profile. 

The U.S. elections in November 2024 could increase economic and geopolitical uncertainty given that current opinion polls 
indicate a potentially close outcome which could usher in radically different trade and foreign policies. The EU is also holding 
elections in June 2024 where populist parties could increase their share of the vote, potentially increasing political polarization 
and fragmentation in Europe. Other regions which are holding or expected to hold local / general elections in 2024 include the 
UK, Turkey, South Africa and India with unexpected outcomes having the potential to drive local market volatility and economic 
uncertainty. 

There have been a number of military coups in 2023 mainly concentrated in West Africa. None of these have had a material 
impact on the bank. The Bank’s risk management frameworks, including its approach to managing country risk, are designed 
to avoid undue concentration risks to such events, but an extension of such events to other countries and regions may lead 
to financial losses and operational disruption in a downside. 

Uncertainty and associated economic downside risks have declined over the three years since the  UK left the EU’s single 
market  and  customs  union.  However,  negotiations  between  the  UK  and  the  EU  have  continued,  with  regard  to  financial 
services not extensively covered by the existing deal. The extension to the temporary equivalence arrangements for UK CCPs 
(Central  Clearing  Counterparties)  until  June  2025  has  temporarily  removed  the  risk  that  access  to  UK  clearing  would  be 
withheld from EU firms, although firms are advised not to expect any further extension. 

Strategy 

Deutsche Bank’s Global Hausbank strategy includes Group and divisional financial targets and objectives for the period until 
2025.  While  the  Group  continuously  plans  and  adapts  to  changing  situations,  the  bank  runs  the  risk  that  a  significant 
deterioration in the global operating environment, an adverse change in market confidence in the banking sector and/or client 
behavior, as well as higher competition, could lead to the bank missing its 2025 financial targets. As such, Deutsche Bank 
may incur unexpected losses including further impairments and provisions, experience lower than planned profitability or an 
erosion of the bank’s capital or liquidity base and broader financial condition, leading to a material adverse effect on Deutsche 
Bank’s results of operations and share price. This also includes the risk that Deutsche Bank will not be able to make desired 
cash  distributions  and  share  buybacks,  subject  to  regulatory  approval,  shareholder  authorization  and  meeting  German 
corporate law requirements. Where targets reflect commitments to regulators, missing them may also trigger action from such 
regulators or rating agencies. In these situations, the Group would need to take actions to ensure it meets its minimum capital 
or  liquidity  objectives.  These  actions  or  measures  may  result  in  adverse  effects  on  Deutsche  Bank’s  business,  results  of 
operations or strategic plans and targets. 

Deutsche Bank operates in highly competitive markets in all divisions. The ability to deploy capital and fund investments is an 
important success factor. The Group continuously monitors and responds to competitive developments to protect its market 
position  and  realize  growth  opportunities.  Competitors  in  that  context  include  large,  international  banks,  smaller  domestic 
banks as well as emerging and non-banking competitors. 

In 2023, labor market conditions normalized and as a result, employee turnover rates decreased significantly in all regions. 
More  broadly,  higher  global  inflation,  which  is  only  expected  to  moderate  in  2024,  may  lead  to  pressure  on  noninterest 
expenses and the ability of the Group to meet cost targets. 

Deutsche Bank communicated various capital objectives in the section “Strategy”. One of them relates to the CET 1 ratio, 
where Deutsche Bank has the objective to preserve a CET 1 ratio of no less than 200 basis points above the bank’s MDA 
threshold  with  some  variability  possible  in  2024.  The  Group’s  capital  ratio  development  reflects  among  other  things:  the 
operating performance of core businesses; the extent of its restructuring costs and the delivery of associated benefits from 
change initiatives including for example front-to-back optimization programs; cost related to potential litigation and regulatory 
enforcement  actions; growth in  the  balance  sheet usage  of  the  core businesses;  changes in the  bank’s  tax and  pensions 
accounts; impacts on Other Comprehensive Income; and changes in regulation and regulatory technical standards. 

The Group enters into contracts and letters of intent in connection with its ongoing transformation as well as in the ordinary 
course of business. When these are preliminary in nature or conditional, the Group is exposed to the risk that they do not 
result in execution of the final agreement or consummation of the proposed arrangement, putting associated benefits with 
such agreements at risk. 

The  financial  results  of  the  bank  could  be  adversely  impacted  if  anticipated  benefits  from  mergers  and  acquisitions,  joint 
ventures,  strategic  partnerships,  planned  cost  savings  and  other  investments  do  not  materialize.  At  the  same  time,  any 
integration  process  will  require  significant  time  and  resources,  and  the  bank  may  not  be  able  to  manage  the  process 
successfully.

Risks 

All of the above could have a material impact on the Group’s CET 1 ratio as well as other target ratios. It is therefore possible 
that the bank will fall below e.g., the CET 1 ratio objective of no less than 200 basis points above the bank’s MDA threshold, 
the cost/income ratio target, or the Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity target, as highlighted in the section “Strategy” 
in this report. 

Liquidity and funding 

Deutsche  Bank  maintained  investment  grade  ratings with  all leading  credit  rating  agencies  through  the  year  2023.  During 
2023, Deutsche Bank was upgraded by Fitch, DBRS and S&P by one notch each. 

Throughout 2023, there was pressure on banks to pass on rising interest rates to customers. By the end of 2023, interest 
rates appear to have peaked, although quantitative tightening by central banks may continue, leading to less supply of liquidity 
for banks. It is possible that Minimum Mandatory Reserves levels are increased by central banks, which could reduce usable 
and reported liquidity and may restrict bank lending. 

At the same time, a further downturn in the macro-economic environment could lead to a decline in deposit levels and loan 
growth. This effect could lead to customers moving away from overnight to term deposits in search of better rates in the current 
environment which could be further exacerbated by competitive pricing pressures from other deposit-taking institutions. 

Early 2023 was a turbulent period for banks driven by failure or restructuring of several U.S. regional banks and one major 
European bank. While the liquidity environment of the bank has improved since the start of 2023, as demonstrated by a return 
of deposit balances and clients, the geopolitical and economic environment could have an adverse impact on Deutsche Bank’s 
credit spread levels,  liquidity  metrics  or the  bank’s  rating in  the  future.  As  of  December 31, 2023, the  bank  demonstrated 
strong liquidity and funding metrics which were well above the regulatory requirements and internal risk appetite, providing a 
strong basis to manage, if required, through future periods of market volatility or stress. 

Postbank IT migration 

Deutsche Bank completed the last data migration of Postbank in July 2023. While the IT migration focused on executing the 
transfer of clients and employees’ use of the new IT infrastructure, it led to operational issues and client backlog. Deutsche 
Bank has implemented several mitigation measures and devised a remediation plan, which is monitored by the BaFin via a 
monitor as outlined in the respective order. 

Deutsche Bank has made progress in remediating outstanding inquiries. In most processes, this was accomplished by year 
end 2023, however for selected processes the backlog remediation is ongoing and is expected to be mainly resolved by the 
end of first quarter 2024. There is a remaining risk when cases are not handled in a timely manner. In case the bank needs 
more time to process the outstanding inquiries, credit and operational costs could increase further and/or impact the bank’s 
reputation and may result in loss of clients or business. This in turn could impact the bank’s future results.  

Regulatory supervisory reforms, assessments and proceedings 

The regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in response to weaknesses identified during the last financial crisis together 
with increased regulatory scrutiny and discretion will impose material costs on the bank, create significant uncertainty and 
may adversely affect the Group’s business plans as well as its ability to execute the bank’s strategic plans in the medium-
term. Those changes that require the bank to maintain increased capital may significantly affect the bank’s business model, 
financial condition, and results of operation as well as the competitive environment more generally. 

Supervisors can also impose capital surcharges or regulatory adjustments, for example, as a result of the regular Supervisory 
Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) performed by the ECB on an annual basis. Such adjustments may, for example, 
reflect additional risks posed by deficiencies in the Group’s control environment, concerning the treatment of specific portfolios, 
products or transactions. Following the 2023 SREP, Deutsche Bank has been informed by the ECB of its decision regarding 
prudential capital requirements to be maintained from January 1, 2024, onwards, that Deutsche Bank’s Pillar 2 Requirement 
amounts to 2.65%, a reduction of five basis points compared to the bank’s Pillar 2 Requirement applicable for 2023. ECB’s 
SREP decision also includes, for the first time, a Pillar 2 Requirement for the leverage ratio of 10 basis points, effective from 
January 1, 2024, onwards. Further, the decision includes conclusions the ECB draws from regulatory stress tests conducted 
by the EBA or the ECB. The ECB evaluates each bank’s performance from a qualitative angle to inform the decision on the 
level of Pillar 2 Requirement and a quantitative outcome which is one aspect when assessing the level of Pillar 2 Guidance. 
The ECB has already used these powers in its SREP decisions in the past and it may continue to do so to address findings 
from onsite inspections. In extreme cases, the ECB can even suspend certain activities or permission to operate within their 
jurisdictions and impose monetary fines for failures to comply with rules applicable to the guidelines.

Regulators  across  the  world  can  also  impose  capital  surcharges  to  address  macroeconomic  risks,  through  the  use  of 
macroprudential tools. These include CET1 buffer increases that could apply group-wide or only for local activities at national 
level or for specific types of exposures (e.g., mortgages). The use of these tools is governed by the applicable macroprudential 
framework in the EU or any other relevant jurisdiction and are typically decided by national macroprudential authorities, such 
as BaFin, often on the basis of Central Bank analysis for macroeconomic risks. 

Several  future  changes  to  macroprudential  tools  are  expected  to  impact  Deutsche  Bank’s  business.  The  European 
Commission  had  previously  announced  a  review  of  the  EU  macroprudential  regime  for  2022-2023.  Deutsche  Bank  now 
understands that these reviews will not take place within the envisaged timeline. The European Commission will continue 
looking at these issues in 2024, and there is always a possibility for a legislative proposal, especially after the new European 
Commission is appointed in October 2024. Such reforms could result in an increase of the bank’s level of capital requirements, 
including capital buffers, additional capital requirements for securitizations or an increase in risk-weighted assets. 

In December 2023, the EU co-legislators, i.e., the European Parliament and the Council, confirmed their agreement for the 
reform of the EU prudential rules (Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive – CRR III and CRD VI), implementing the 
Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) Final Basel III reforms. These reforms change how EU banks will calculate 
their risk weighted assets. The European Commission has advised that the reforms will apply as of January 2025, but the 
output floor, which limits the internal-model RWA to ultimately 72.5% of the standardized approach RWA, to apply fully in 
January 2030. Final Basel III will increase the bank’s RWA and associated capital requirements. The reform is also being 
implemented, with different timelines, in all major jurisdictions.  

In April 2023, the European Commission issued a legislative proposal for reform of the EU crisis management and deposit 
insurance  framework,  with  amendments  to  all  relevant  Directives  and  Regulations,  including  the  Bank  Recovery  and 
Resolution Directive, the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive. The purpose 
of the legislative proposal is, among other things, to further harmonize and regulate the crisis management and resolution of 
small- and medium-sized EU banks, which is currently subject to some degree of national discretion. In its legislative proposal 
the  Commission  includes  several  changes  that  could  impact  Deutsche  Bank  and  its  clients,  including  a  change  in  the 
insolvency hierarchy of claims of all depositors, including those uninsured by deposit guarantee schemes. Also, the proposals 
provide for an expanded possibility by authorities to use the funds of national deposit guarantee scheme to contribute to the 
resolution  of  a  bank,  and  thus  giving  also  access  to  the  Single  Resolution  Fund.  This  European  Commission  legislative 
proposal will now follow the regular EU co-legislative process, with the involvement of the EU 27 Member States and the 
European Parliament. The finalization of the revised directives and regulation may take several years, depending on the ability 
of the co-legislators to reach a compromise, and could differ significantly from the original Commission proposal. 

On May 24, 2023, the European Commission published a Retail Investment Strategy, proposing a series of measures and 
amendments  to  the  current legislative  framework to  boost  retail  investor  participation  and  strengthen  consumer trust.  The 
strategy is currently under discussions in the Parliament and Council, before the Parliament and Council enter into political 
negotiations.  

The political negotiations on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (MiFID II / R) concluded in June 
2023. The final text is awaiting adoption by both co-legislators before being published in the Official Journal and subsequently 
entered into force. Further technical work on post-trade transparency requirements, through consultations by the European 
Commission and ESMA, is expected to continue in 2024.  

On June 28, 2023, the European Commission published two legislative packages, one linked to the introduction of a digital 
euro, the other on financial data access and payments. The European Parliament and EU Member States are now to discuss 
both packages. It is expected that the final legal text will only be agreed after the European Parliaments elections of June 2024. 

Focus in Europe is moving more towards transition finance. The European Commission has published a report that provides 
high level guidance on these issues. The concept of transition finance, and its development brings with it, certain uncertainties 
for banks. In addition, the detailed framework for the EU Taxonomy that has been put in place by European legislators will 
likely be reviewed by the European Commission. It is expected that the next European Commission will include both elements 
in its work program for 2025 to 2029. Both rapidly changing regulatory as well as stakeholder demands may materially affect 
Deutsche Bank’s business, results of operations or strategic plans if the bank fails to adopt or implement its measures to 
transition to a low-carbon economy.

The  Commission’s  legislative  proposal  for  a  refit  of  the  European  Market  Infrastructure  Regulation.  has  been  in  political 
negotiations between the Council (representing Member States) and the European Parliament since December 2023 and will 
continue in early 2024, with the aim of finalizing it before the elections in the European Parliament in June this year. 

In addition, Deutsche Bank may be impacted by future decisions made by the Court of Justice of the EU in regards to the 
terms and conditions related to irrevocable payment commitments to the SRF. If a ruling by the court is deemed to have a 
negative  impact  on  the  current  accounting  treatment  of  such  irrevocable  payment  commitments,  this  could  result  in  an 
accounting loss and have a material adverse effect on the bank’s results of operations. 

For  Indian  CCPs,  the  BaFin  published  a  statement  on  February  17,  2023,  allowing  German  credit  institutions,  including 
Deutsche Bank, the possibility to remain members of the six India CCPs until October 31, 2024. This allows European banks, 
including Deutsche Bank, to make any changes needed so that the clients can continue to be served even after. 

Supervisors can also impose other capital surcharges, such as the increase of macroprudential capital buffers including the 
Countercyclical Capital Buffer and the Systemic Risk Buffer.  

In summary, both the regulatory and legislative environment are expected to be dynamic and can impact Deutsche Bank’s 
revenue and costs (e.g., the cost to ensure ongoing and future compliance). 

Legal and regulatory enforcement proceedings and tax examinations  

Deutsche Bank is subject to a number of legal and regulatory enforcement proceedings and tax examinations. The outcome 
of these proceedings is difficult to predict and may substantially and adversely affect the bank’s planned results of operations, 
financial condition and reputation. If these matters are resolved on terms that are more adverse to the bank than expected, in 
terms of their costs or necessary changes to Deutsche Bank’s businesses or operations, or if related negative perceptions 
concerning the bank’s business and prospects and related business impacts increase, Deutsche Bank may not be able to 
achieve its strategic objectives or may be required to change these objectives. 

More generally, the bank operates in a highly and increasingly regulated and litigious environment, potentially exposing the 
bank to liability and other costs, the amounts of which may be substantial and difficult to estimate, as well as to legal and 
regulatory sanctions and reputational harm. The bank continues to maintain a regular dialogue with its supervisory authorities 
who  expect  the  bank  to  deliver  control  improvements  at  a  faster  pace  and  in  a  higher  quality  manner.  Deutsche  Bank 
understands this criticism and is committed to meeting these expectations. 

Should any of the legal proceedings be resolved against the bank, or any investigations result in a finding that the bank failed 
to  comply  with  applicable  law,  the  bank  could  be  exposed  to  material  damages,  fines,  limitations  on  business,  remedial 
undertakings, criminal prosecution, or other material adverse effects on Deutsche Bank’s financial condition, as well as risk to 
its reputation and potential loss of business because of extensive media attention. Guilty pleas by or convictions of the bank 
or its affiliates in criminal proceedings, or regulatory or enforcement orders, settlements, or agreements to which the bank or 
its affiliates become subject, may have consequences that have adverse effects on certain of its businesses. 

Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime 

Combatting financial crime and complying with applicable laws and regulations is vital to ensuring the stability of banks, such 
as Deutsche Bank, and the integrity of the international financial system.  

A robust and effective internal control environment and adequate infrastructure (comprising people, policies and procedures, 
controls testing, and IT systems) are necessary to ensure that the bank conducts its business in compliance with the laws, 
regulations, and associated supervisory expectations.  

The bank’s compliance controls and surveillance processes, as well as other internal control processes that are aimed at 
ensuring the proper conduct of its businesses and services as well at preventing market abuse, insider dealing, and conduct 
breaches, are from time to time subject to regulatory reviews and/or inquiries in certain jurisdictions.

Furthermore, the bank’s anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your client (KYC) processes and controls aimed at preventing 
misuse  of  the  bank’s  products  and  services  to  commit  financial  crime,  continue  to  be  the  subject  of  regulatory  reviews, 
investigations,  and  enforcement  actions  in  several  jurisdictions.  The  bank  continually  seeks  to  enhance  the  efficacy  of  its 
internal control environment and improve its infrastructure to revised regulatory requirements and to close gaps identified by 
the bank and/or by regulators and monitors. 

The BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank in September 2018 to take appropriate internal safeguards and comply with general due 
diligence obligations to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing and in February 2019 to review the bank’s group-
wide  risk  management  processes  in  correspondent  banking  and  adjust  them  where  necessary.  In  April  2021,  the  BaFin 
prolonged previous orders and ordered the bank to adopt further appropriate internal safeguards and comply with due diligence 
obligations,  with  regards  to  regular  client  file  reviews.  This  expansion  also  applies  to  correspondent  relationships  and 
transaction  monitoring.  The  BaFin  has  appointed  a  Special  Representative  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  ordered 
measures as well as to assess and report on the progress of the implementation to the BaFin. 

On  September  28,  2022,  the  BaFin  ordered  Deutsche  Bank  AG  to  take  specific  measures  aimed  at  preventing  money 
laundering and terrorist financing in order to implement the orders that the BaFin issued on September 21, 2018, and February 
15, 2019. The bank has completed the remediation activities that were the subject of this order. 

In November 2023, the BaFin ordered the bank to take specific measures to improve data processing systems for transaction 
monitoring and has threatened to impose financial penalties in case of non-fulfillment. There are no new findings in the order, 
however, the order sets a binding timeframe for the implementation of measures that were already agreed. To monitor the 
implementation  progress  of  the  agreed  measures,  the  mandate  of  the  Special  Representative  has  been  prolonged  until 
30 October  2024.  The  bank  will  continue  to  fully  cooperate  with  the BaFin  and  the  Special  Representative  and  invest  the 
necessary resources to implement these measures within the deadlines. 

In July 2023, the bank entered into a Consent Order and Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve resolving previously 
disclosed regulatory discussions concerning adherence to prior orders and settlements related to sanctions and embargoes 
and  AML compliance, a  prior correspondent  banking  relationship  and  remedial  agreements and  obligations related  to  risk 
management issues. Both the Consent Order and Written Agreement require the bank to comply with and effectuate certain 
remedial  undertakings.  To  the  extent  the  Bank  does  not  comply  with  such  undertakings, it  may  face  additional  regulatory 
action, including further civil monetary penalties and business restrictions.  

On  September  25,  2023,  DWS  agreed  to  cease-and-desist  orders  and  civil  money  penalties  to  settle  SEC  investigations. 
These matters related to certain historic processes, procedures and marketing practices DWS has since addressed or is in 
the process of addressing. 

In October 2023, the BaFin imposed a fine for delayed filing of suspicious activity reports to the German Financial Intelligence 
Unit. The publication resulted from an administrative order issued by BaFin in this matter on March 21, 2023. Deutsche Bank 
has accepted the fine and the matter is resolved. 

As discussed elsewhere in this document, the war in Ukraine led to a significant increase in sanctions against Russian state 
entities, as well as companies and individuals linked to Russia. Export control restrictions also have increased the compliance 
burden  on  banks.  In  addition,  the  U.S.’s  recently  enacted  Executive  Order  14114,  which  establishes  a  new  secondary 
sanctions regime whereby severe measures can be taken against foreign financial institutions facilitating transactions involving 
broad sectors of the Russian economy, including manufacturing and technology sectors. These secondary sanction measures 
increase operational burden and regulatory risk for foreign banks with clients that have business operations in or with entities 
in  Russia.  Similarly,  several  regulators  imposed  further  sanctions  against  individuals  and  entities  with  suspected  ties  to 
terrorism  following  Hamas’  attack  on  Israel  in  October  2023.  Deutsche  Bank  manages  these  sanctions  with  enhanced 
communications,  guidance  and  operational  support  led  by  AFC’s  Sanctions  &  Embargoes  team.  To  control  this  risk, 
transactions are filtered, client and counterparty data is screened, trade in sanctioned financial instruments is restricted, goods 
and commodities (such as oil) subject to trade finance restrictions are screened in a risk-based approach and further measures 
such  as  rejecting  or  freezing  a  transaction,  restricting  client  activities,  exiting  a  client  relationship  or  obtaining  required 
regulatory authorizations are taken.

Risk management policies, procedures and methods 

The Group has devoted significant resources to develop its risk management policies, procedures and methods, including 
with respect to market, credit, liquidity, operational as well as reputational and model risk. However, the bank may not be fully 
effective in mitigating its risk exposures in all economic or market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that 
the bank fails to identify or anticipate. Where the Group uses models to calculate risk-weighted assets for regulatory purposes, 
potential deficiencies may also lead regulators to impose a recalibration of input parameters or a complete review of the model. 

Deutsche Bank has exposure to operational risks arising from potential failures in its internal control environment or errors in 
the  performance  of  the  bank’s  processes,  e.g.,  in  transaction  processing,  technology  failures  as  well  as  loss  of  business 
continuity, which may disrupt Deutsche Bank’s business and lead to material losses.  

Information technology and security build the basis for the business operations of Deutsche Bank, complementing processes 
and organizational structures. The continuously evolving threats, along with evolving technology and changes in the business 
landscape require constant efforts to retain an acceptable level of risk. The bank maintains its ability to operate and protect 
itself through established security capabilities, processes and governance. However, the volatile external environment, the 
constant flow of new zero day exploits and other new vulnerabilities and continued use of platforms that no longer fit into the 
strategic architecture, remain a risk for the stability of the bank’s technology with the potential of increased service outages. 
The potential impact in case of a security event could be wide ranging, from minor to extreme issues leading to technology 
failures, security breaches, unauthorized access, as well as loss or destruction of data. 

Delays in the implementation of regulatory requirements, including consumer protection measures and its strategic projects 
could also have a negative impact on the bank’s revenues and costs. In addition, the Group is also exposed to conduct risk, 
comprising risks relating to inappropriate business practices, including selling products that are not suitable for a particular 
customer,  fraud,  unauthorized  trading  and  failure  to  comply  with  applicable  regulations,  laws  and  internal  policies.  For 
example,  an  employee’s  misconduct reflecting  fraudulent intent may  lead  to  not only  material  losses  but  also  reputational 
damage. Conduct risk is elevated owning to increased focus by regulators on misconduct, particularly as an indicator of the 
health of risk management, the bank has implemented controls to monitor and mitigate the risk.  

Any of the aforementioned risks or events could potentially result in litigation, a financial loss, disruption of business activities 
and liability to the bank’s customers, regulatory scrutiny, government intervention or damage to its reputation. At the same 
time, managing these and other risks requires continual adaptation of the bank’s controls. 

As  a  global  bank,  Deutsche  Bank  is  often  in  the  news.  The  bank  conducts  its  media  dialogue  through  official  teams  yet, 
Deutsche Bank internal information, including confidential matters have been subject to external news media coverage. Media 
leaks  can  have  severe  consequences  for  Deutsche  Bank,  particularly  when  they  involve  inaccurate  statements,  rumors, 
speculation or unsanctioned opinions. Similarly, clients of Deutsche Bank can approach the media to express dissatisfaction 
or  raise  adverse  communication  through  social  media  platforms,  potentially  causing  widespread  reputational  impact. 
Legitimate negative publication on Deutsche Bank is addressed with immediate action plans including concrete measures and 
commitments to clients with timely communication. While the bank has processes in place, its ability to protect itself against 
these risks is limited, resulting in exposure of financial consequences such as the loss of confidence or business with clients 
and potential impact to the bank’s share price. 

In the banking industry, divergence continues in how financial institutions define portfolio types and asset classes including 
around ESG-related themes. There are often no industry or universally accepted definitions, particularly with respect to assets 
intended  to  be  classified  as  Green  or  ESG-compliant,  and  differences  can  be  driven  by  divergence  between  a  risk 
management and accounting view. These variances could impact the way external stakeholders assess the underlying risk 
exposures to such portfolio types and asset classes. If losses would exceed market expectations in a certain portfolio type or 
asset class, this could impact the bank’s reputation and adversely affect Deutsche Bank’s planned results of operations and 
financial targets. 

Similarly, there can be divergence in views when it comes to devising scenarios for e.g., stress testing purposes or in the 
context of scenarios applied when assessing potential provisioning requirements for institutional clients on an individual basis. 
As assessments of future developments are naturally exposed to uncertainties there is the risk that the future may turn out 
differently. 

In order to manage financial and non-financial risk impacts from e.g., geopolitical or other fast developing events, Deutsche 
Bank utilizes dedicated governance structures including Global and Regional Crisis Management. Where relevant, additional 
controls  and  processes  have  been  and would be  employed. This would  also entail  additional  reporting  to  ensure relevant 
senior stakeholders including the Management Board are up-to date.

Third Party Vendor Management 

Financial institutions rely on third-party service providers for a range of services, some of which support their critical operations. 
These dependencies have grown in recent years as part of the increasing trend in digitalization of the financial services sector 
which can bring multiple benefits including flexibility, innovation and improved operational resilience. However, if not properly 
managed,  disruption  to  critical  services  or  service  providers  could  pose  risks  to  financial  institutions,  and  in  some  cases, 
financial stability.  

The regulatory framework for managing third party risk continues to evolve and becomes increasingly complex as regulators 
seek to address various objectives. There are two main areas of focus including how financial institutions manage their third-
party risks and how to address the systemic risks caused by concentration of services provided by critical third parties. 

The recent examples of the publication of the Financial Stability Board toolkit on enhancing third party risk management and 
oversight, the consultation paper on Critical Third Parties issued by the UK regulators and Digital Operational Resilience Act 
(DORA) introduced by EU regulators demonstrate the regulators’ strong intent to protect the financial stability by addressing 
the potential systemic risks caused by the third parties. 

Deutsche Bank has a well-established approach to Third Party Risk Management; from a clear policy and procedure through 
to centralized risk process for businesses to use when engaging with third parties. To respond to the increasing regulatory 
demand,  Deutsche  Bank  is  continuously  enhancing  the  bank’s  current  control  environment.  In  2023,  the  bank  achieved 
improved efficiency, a more proportionate approach, real time monitoring and better culture of awareness to protect the bank 
from third party risk. 

When  using  third-party  service  providers,  the  bank  remains  fully  responsible  and  accountable  for  complying  with  all  the 
regulatory obligations, including the ability to oversee the outsourcing of critical or important functions. The bank may face 
risks of material losses or reputational damage if third parties fail to provide services as agreed with the bank and/or in line 
with regulatory requirements.  

Similar to cybersecurity threats to Deutsche Bank, a successful cyberattack on a third party vendor could have a significant 
negative impact on the bank that may result in the disclosure or misuse of client as well as proprietary information, damage 
or  inability  to  access  information  technology  systems,  financial  losses,  additional  costs,  personal  data  breach  notification 
obligations, reputational damage, client dissatisfaction and potential regulatory penalties or litigation exposure 

In situations where Deutsche Bank is the third party service provider, the bank may be exposed to financial risks, such as lost 
revenues, costs and expenses associated with the cancellation of the service agreement, if Deutsche Bank were no longer 
able to benefit from the relationship.  

Goodwill and other intangible assets 

Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred.  

Other intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other 
legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. These assets are tested for impairment, or their useful lives reaffirmed 
at least annually. This includes the testing in relation to software impairments. 

The determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of non-financial assets requires estimates based 
on quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, present value or other valuation techniques, or a combination 
thereof, necessitating management to make subjective judgments and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could 
result in significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change. Impairments of goodwill 
and other intangible assets have had and may have a material adverse effect on profitability and results of operations. 

Pension Obligations 

Deutsche Bank sponsors a number of post-employment benefit plans on behalf of its employees, including defined benefit 
plans. To the extent that the factors that drive the bank’s pension liabilities move in a manner adverse to it, or that the bank’s 
assumptions  regarding  key  variables  prove  incorrect,  or  that  Deutsche  Bank’s  funding  of  the  pension  liabilities  does  not 
sufficiently hedge those liabilities, the bank could be required to make additional contributions or be exposed to actuarial or 
accounting losses in respect of the bank’s pension plans.

Deferred Tax Assets 

The  bank  recognizes  deferred  tax  assets  for  future  tax  consequences  attributable  to  temporary  differences  between  the 
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, unused tax losses and 
unused tax credits. To the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or a 
portion  of  the  deferred  tax  assets  to  be  utilized,  the  bank  must  reduce  the  carrying  amounts.  Each  quarter,  the  bank  re-
evaluates  its  estimate  related  to  deferred  tax  assets,  which  can  change  from  period  to  period  and  requires  significant 
management judgment. Reductions in the amount of deferred tax assets from a change in estimate have had and may in the 
future have material adverse effects on its profitability, equity and financial condition. 

Technology, Data and Innovation 

Digital  Innovation  offers  market  entry  opportunities  for  new  competitors  such  as  cross-industry  entrants,  global  high-tech 
companies  or  financial  technology  companies.  Therefore,  the  bank  expects  its  businesses  to  have  an  increased  need  for 
investments in digital product and process resources to mitigate the risk of a potential loss of market share. 

To  be  able  to  respond  to  market  developments,  respond  more  quickly  to  client  needs  and  to  have  more  flexibility,  and  to 
improve IT resiliency, the bank has decided to migrate a large number of applications to the Public Cloud through a strategic 
partnership  with  Google  Cloud. This  partnership  with  Google Cloud  is  a  major milestone  in  the  bank’s  digital  journey  and 
shows  a  commitment  to  embrace  new  technologies.  The  objective  is  to  enhance  the  client  experience  through  improved 
products and services, system resiliency and security as well as reducing the cost inefficiencies of running legacy platforms. 
Such  a  major  technology  migration  requires  robust  governance  and  planning,  including  required  allocation  of  funding,  to 
manage the risk of security and stability issues. Additionally, there is significant regulatory interest in this program. Also, as 
with  any  external  service  providers,  the  bank  must  ensure  the  highest  standards  of  data  privacy  and  security  controls  to 
safeguard client and bank information. Failure to do so can compromise client trust, lead to financial losses and, in severe 
cases, regulatory penalties, litigation and the obligation to compensate individuals for damage. 

Reliance on third parties’ products and services that support critical operations can affect the bank’s risk posture, because 
these  can  be  the  target  of  new  and  evolving  information  security  attacks.  This  risk,  along  with  expanded  regulatory 
requirements, has necessitated an increased use of technology to better identify information security risks across third parties 
and, where necessary, pro-actively perform outreach with them.  

Deutsche Bank manages third party information security risks by means of its global third-party risk management program. 
This program includes an information security policy specifically for third parties that sets forth the bank’s control objectives 
and expectations. Additionally, Deutsche Bank has a third-party risk management process designed to identify, monitor, and 
mitigate risks arising from working with third parties, which includes the bank’s oversight of third parties’ operations related to 
the  services  provided  to  the  bank.  Deutsche  Bank  operates  in  an  environment  with  increasing  levels  of  digitization  and  a 
continually evolving threat landscape related to information security. Cyber-attacks and other internet crime could result in 
material losses of client or customer information, damage the bank’s reputation and lead to regulatory penalties and financial 
losses. 

The bank closely observes relevant technological developments, the geopolitical landscape and economic impacts driving 
security  risks  and  assesses  their  relevance  for  potential  impact  to  Deutsche  Bank  and  the  wider  financial  ecosystem. 
Financially motivated and other cyber-attacks like ransomware or denial of service, can be observed as a persistent threat 
across industries and to become more frequent. Additional threats are posed by supply chain attacks, an increasing frequency 
of critical software vulnerabilities potentially exploited by threat actors (zero-day exploits), and an expanding threat surface 
introduced by e.g., remote ways of working or the use of cloud services. The 2023 focus areas included besides the common 
attack scenarios the Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing. 

Deutsche Bank may face operational risks arising from failures in the control environment including errors in the performance 
of its processes or security controls, as well as loss of data, which may disrupt the bank’s business and lead to material losses. 
At the  same time,  the  bank  may  also  face  risks  of  material losses  or reputational damage if  services  are not  provided  as 
agreed or in line with internal standards. 

Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions have experienced attacks on computer systems, including attacks aimed at 
obtaining  unauthorized  access  to  confidential  company  or  client  information,  damaging,  or  interfering  with  company  data, 
resources, or business activities, or otherwise exploiting vulnerabilities in its infrastructure, including attacks that occurred at 
the  bank’s  third-party  providers.  Deutsche  Bank  group  expects  to  continue  to  be  the  target  of  such  attacks  in  the  future. 
Although to date the bank has not experienced any material business impact from these attacks, the group may not be able 
to effectively anticipate and prevent more material attacks from occurring in the future. Accordingly, Deutsche Bank continues 
to invest toward the protection of its systems, including data, infrastructure, devices and applications, against such breaches 
and toward ensuring that its vendors employ appropriate cybersecurity safeguards. These measures, however, may not be 
effective against the many security threats Deutsche Bank group faces.

Risks and Opportunities 
Risks 

Deutsche Bank is still maturing in its overall data management strategy against its core processes and data sets such as 
transactional,  client  and  reference  data.  This  includes  the  development  and  implementation  of  the  bank’s  enterprise 
architecture principles across the core technology infrastructure. This is central to Deutsche Bank’s wider technology and data 
strategy, enabling business growth and efficiencies, while also enhancing the control environment. Deutsche Bank’s regulators 
are actively engaged in ensuring the bank progresses with this component of its strategy. Furthermore, the bank also faces 
challenges  with  respect  to  embracing  and  incorporating  new  and  disruptive  technologies  in  conjunction  with  existing 
technological architecture in order to ensure industry standards of information security and customer experience. 

Major technology transformations in the bank’s business and infrastructure areas are executed via dedicated initiatives. The 
benefits of  these  include  IT  and  business  cost  reduction, control  improvements,  revenue  growth  through  provision  of  new 
client features or targeted client growth. Program execution risks, including talent and financial constraints, dependencies to 
other programs and key deliverables (also referred to as KDs), extended implementation timelines or impact of the change 
related activity on the control environment or functionality issues in the upgraded applications or underlying technology are 
carefully managed to partially mitigate the risk of not fully achieving expected benefits. 

Environmental, social and governance 

The  impacts  of  rising  global  temperatures  and  the  associated  policy,  technology  and  behavioral  changes  required  to  limit 
global warming to no greater than 1.5oc above pre-industrial levels have led to emerging sources of financial and non-financial 
risks. These include the physical risk impacts from extreme weather events, and transition risks as carbon-intensive sectors 
are faced with higher costs, potentially reduced demand and restricted access to financing. More rapid than currently expected 
emergence of transition and / or physical climate risks and other environmental risks may lead to increased credit and market 
losses  as  well  as  operational  disruptions  due  to  impacts  on  vendors  and  the  bank’s  own  operations.  Deutsche  Bank  has 
integrated Climate and Environmental risk considerations throughout its risk and control frameworks to ensure that risks are 
identified, monitored and managed.  

Furthermore,  financial  institutions  are  facing  increased  scrutiny  on  Climate  and  ESG-related  issues  from  governments, 
regulators, shareholders and other bodies (including non-governmental organizations), leading to reputational risks if the bank 
is not seen to support the transition to a lower carbon economy, to limit nature-related risks such as biodiversity and habitat 
loss,  and  to  protect  human  rights.  This  increased  scrutiny  includes  more  extensive  and  prescriptive  ESG  disclosure 
requirements such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The emergence of significantly diverging ESG 
regulatory and / or disclosure standards across jurisdictions could lead to higher costs of compliance and risks of failing to 
meet requirements. 

Deutsche Bank is rated by a number of ESG rating providers, with the ratings increasingly utilized as criteria to determine 
eligibility for sustainable investments and to assess management of ESG risks and opportunities. The methodologies and 
scores used by the different providers can lead to significant divergence in results. Should the bank’s ratings lag peers, or 
materially deteriorate, this could lead to negative reputational impacts and reduced investor demand for equity / debt. Improved 
ratings may have the opposite effect. 

Data,  methodologies  and  industry  standards  for  measuring  and  assessing  climate  and  other  environmental  risks  are  still 
evolving or, in certain cases, are not yet available. This, combined with a lack of comprehensive and consistent climate and 
other environmental risk disclosures by its clients means that the bank, in line with the wider industry, is heavily reliant on 
proxy estimates and/or proprietary approaches for its own climate and environmental risk management disclosures. The high 
degree of uncertainty that this creates increases the risk that third parties may assert that the bank’s sustainability-related 
disclosures constitute greenwashing. Positively, enhanced disclosure requirements for our clients will reduce reliance on proxy 
estimates and/or proprietary approaches going forwards. 

While Deutsche Bank remains committed to the targets and ambitions outlined in its Sustainability Deep Dive on March 2, 
2023, the bank may face headwinds in achieving its aim for € 500 billion in cumulative ESG financing and investment volumes 
through the end of 2025. If ambitions or targets are missed, this could impact, among other things, revenues and the reputation 
of the bank. In addition, scarcity of ESG assets may reduce Deutsche Bank’s ability to issue ESG compliant funding. Similarly, 
significant  deviations  from  absolute  and  intensity-based  net  zero  aligned  emissions  targets  may  open  the  bank  up  to 
reputational risks. 

Certain  jurisdictions  have  begun  to  develop  anti-ESG  measures  including  requiring  financial  institutions  that  wish  to  do 
business  with  them  to  certify  their  non-adherence  to  aspects  of  the  transition  agenda.  Failing  to  comply  with  these 
requirements  may  result  in  the  termination  of  existing  business  and  the  inability  to  conduct  new  business  with  those 
jurisdictions, while complying may lead to reputational risks.

Opportunities 

Macroeconomic and market conditions 

Should economic conditions, such as GDP growth, levels of unemployment, the interest rate environment and competitive 
conditions in the financial services industry improve beyond currently forecasted levels, this could result in higher revenues. 
These impacts may only be partially offset by additional costs, therefore improving the Group’s ability to meet its financial 
targets.  At  the  same  time,  potentially  higher  inflation,  interest  rates  and  market  volatility  could  present  a  number  of 
opportunities,  such  as  increased  revenues  from  higher  trading  flows  amid  private,  corporate  and  institutional  customers 
repositioning  their portfolios,  higher net interest  income as  well  as  higher margins  on  lending  across the  Group’s  balance 
sheet. 

A substantial proportion of the assets and liabilities on the Group’s balance sheet are of financial instruments carried at fair 
value, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. If market conditions improve or interest rates decline, 
this could result in an increase in the fair value of certain financial instruments. As a result of such changes, the Group may 
realize gains in the future. 

Geopolitics 

While  rising  geopolitical  risk  creates  uncertainty  which  undermines  the  global  growth  outlook  and  leads  to  increased 
fragmentation of the business environment, Deutsche Bank could benefit from supporting clients to de-risk their supply chains 
and rebalance their global footprint if the fragmentation of the international trade order accelerates. Should geopolitical risk 
unexpectedly subside, the outlook for global growth could improve beyond the bank’s assumptions with positive implications 
for revenues and risk metrics. 

Regulatory change 

Regulatory change can encourage banks to provide better products or services that can offer opportunities for differentiation 
in the marketplace. For example, as reporting standards continue to develop for sustainable finance, the market may evolve 
to embrace sustainable finance initiatives more broadly. As clients and the market adopt sustainable finance related initiatives, 
the Group may have the opportunity to further differentiate the bank by enhancing the services provided to its clients. 

Strategy 

Deutsche Bank’s Global Hausbank strategy outlines the bank’s approach to materially improve returns to shareholders over 
time and how best deploy the balance sheet as well as other resources, in a way that is consistent with the client franchise 
and  risk  appetite  of  the  bank.  As  such,  the  implementation  of  the  Group’s  strategy  may  create  further  opportunities  if 
implemented to a greater extent or under more favorable conditions than anticipated. This includes potential benefits from 
better  than  planned  macroeconomic,  market  and  geopolitical  conditions  or  advantageous  changes  in  the  competitive 
environment, such as the retreat of traditional and emerging, non-banking competitors in selected markets.  

If businesses and processes improve beyond Deutsche Bank’s planned assumptions and cost efficiencies can be realized 
sooner or to a greater extent than forecasted, this could also positively impact the results of operations. The progress could 
be further stimulated if markets react favorably to Deutsche Bank’s rating upgrades and sustained revenue performance. This 
could in turn reduce funding costs and further amplify the bank’s profitability. 

The bank expects to pursue the Group strategy and become the first point of call for all its clients, addressing the full range of 
their financial needs – as their “Global Hausbank”. Deutsche Bank’s expects its over 150-year heritage, global network, market 
expertise, outstanding risk management and comprehensive product range to support growth and targeted investments with 
focus on becoming sustainably profitable while increasing operational efficiencies and maintaining capital discipline.

Risks and Opportunities 
Opportunities 

Within the Corporate Bank, Deutsche Bank sees multi-faceted opportunities across a market leading franchise that leverages 
Corporate  Bank’s  global  footprint  and  coverage  model.  Deutsche  Bank  expects  to  grow  revenues  by  combining  risk 
management solutions with new treasury platform capabilities and establishing the Corporate Bank as a key partner to support 
its clients’ energy transformation, building on its position in Europe and expanding further into APAC.  

The Investment Bank continues to be a global leader in fixed income and financing products, and Deutsche Bank is focused 
on consolidating this position and maintaining the market share gained. To achieve this, combined with the strength of the 
Origination and Advisory platform, which was further enhanced with the acquisition of Numis Corporation PLC, the focus of 
the division is targeted on specific investment into areas of growth adjacent to current businesses to enhance and diversify 
the product offering. Meanwhile, the Investment Bank continues to focus on the optimization of cost and capital across the 
portfolio, and additional enhancements to the control environment. In addition, an increased focus upon the efficiency of the 
division’s client coverage intends to increase the strength and depth of relationships across the global client base.  

For  the  Private  Bank,  focus  remains  on  German  retail,  international  retail  and  business  clients,  and  on  seeking  growth 
predominantly  within  advisory  areas.  With  respect  to  wealth  management  activities,  the  Group  sees  growth  opportunities 
particularly in EMEA and APAC. 

For Asset Management, comprising of DWS legal entities, DWS continues to execute the publicly stated strategy, which aims 
to maintain leadership in mature asset classes and selectively grow other regions and products, in order to cement its status 
as a leading asset manager. Growth areas include revenue opportunities from further asset shifts towards Passive investments 
and Alternative products. 

Deutsche Bank continues to focus on sustainability throughout the bank and has seen opportunities for growth in this space 
across all the bank’s core businesses as clients’ response to climate change gains further traction. Given strong client appetite, 
Deutsche Bank continues to see  sustainable finance as a key opportunity and area of investment. As part of the broader 
efforts to develop a risk appetite strategy to manage climate risk, the bank sees opportunities to support clients, for example, 
in developing credible decarbonization strategies and support their transition. 

Individuals  and  institutions,  including  clients  and  non-clients  of  the  bank,  increasingly  view  ESG-related  opportunities  as 
significant for long-term returns and the bank believes this could become a key differentiator. In this regard, inclusion of ESG 
factors  in  the  investment  processes  or  decision-making  process  for  awarding  business  mandates  across  businesses  is 
growing. As such, Deutsche Bank plans to develop and provide financial products or investment possibilities that can help 
both  the  bank  and  its  clients  to  achieve  common  ESG  goals  and  advance  Deutsche  Bank’s  holistic  ESG  strategy.  More 
broadly, the bank believes that advancing ESG activities can lead to both additional revenues opportunities as well as an 
improved brand and stakeholder perception. 

Additionally, a shared and strong firm-wide risk and control culture, enabled by technology, analytics and the bank’s deep risk 
expertise, may, in parts provide the competitive edge needed to support the growth strategy of Deutsche Bank’s businesses. 

Overall, there are opportunities for Deutsche Bank to gain market share and grow its client base via supporting client needs 
for financing, advice, and risk management.

Opportunities 

Technology, Data and Innovation 

Digital  Innovation  offers  various  revenue  opportunities  to  increase  monetization  on  existing  customers  and  acquire  new 
customer groups by expanding the Group’s own portfolio of products and engaging in product partnerships with third parties, 
thereby potentially benefiting from a shorter time-to-market. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies 
such  as  Generative  AI  and  Large  Language  Models  are  an  area  of  significant  potential  for  Deutsche  Bank’s  operational 
efficiency and revenue growth. The bank is also collaborating with Google on the early adoption of new AI technologies and 
on ‘Responsible AI’ for the banking industry. The bank is experimenting with such technologies in a prudent and responsible 
way to ensure it understands and mitigates risks that may arise before such technologies are deployed into production. The 
Group’s  global  reach  allows  it  to  scale  products  quickly  and  efficiently  across  geographies.  At  the  same  time,  the  bank’s 
customers will benefit from products and services being developed and brought to market more quickly in the future. 

In  addition,  new  forms  of  technology  create  a  new  set  of  digital  assets  and  money,  like  central  bank  digital  currencies, 
tokenized deposits, stablecoins or electronic securities. These have the potential to facilitate cheaper, faster, and more efficient 
financial  transactions,  while  also  unlocking  new  use  cases.  Deutsche  Bank  is  playing  an  active  role  in  providing 
recommendations on how this could be shaped, in particular in the context of the digital euro projects of the ECB for retail and 
wholesale use cases. 

Continued investments and delivery of the bank’s changed agenda, including through key deliverables, should help Deutsche 
Bank to differentiate itself in an otherwise highly competitive market. 

Environmental, social and governance 

As outlined in Deutsche Bank’s Sustainability Deep Dive on March 2, 2023, the transition to a lower carbon economy presents 
multiple opportunities to support clients on their pathways to net zero through the provision of sustainable finance and transition 
expertise.  Additionally,  on  October  19,  2023,  Deutsche  Bank  published  its  Transition  Plan  which  consolidates  the  bank’s 
definitions, methodologies, targets and achievements on its path to net-zero by 2050 in a single publication. Overall, coupled 
with  the  active  management  of  the  Group’s  carbon  footprint  via  its  net  zero  target  regime,  this  can  lead  to  both  revenue 
opportunities as well as improved stakeholder perceptions.

Deutsche Bank regularly assesses the potential impacts of risks on its balance sheet and profitability through portfolio reviews 
and stress tests. Stress tests are also used to test the resilience of Deutsche Bank’s strategic plans. The results of these tests 
indicate  that  the  currently  available  capital  and  liquidity  reserves,  in  combination  with  available  mitigation  measures,  are 
sufficient to withstand periods of potential stress.  

The Group concludes that the risks, as described above or in the following sections, to which Deutsche Bank is exposed to, 
including potential impacts on its business strategy, provide a true and fair picture of its risk profile. 

For further details please refer to sections “Risk profile”, “Risk appetite and capacity”, “Risk and capital plan”, “Stress testing”, 
“Recovery and  resolution  planning”,  “Risk  and capital  management”,  “Capital,  leverage  ratio,  TLAC  and  MREL”,  “Liquidity

Risk and capital overview 
Risk profile 

Risk profile 

Deutsche  Bank’s  mix  of  business  activities  results  in  diverse  risk  taking.  The  Group  measures  key  risks  inherent  to  the 
respective business models through the total economic capital metric, which captures the business division’s risk profile and 
considers cross-risk effects at group level. 

Corporate Bank’s risk profile mainly arises from the products and services offered in Corporate Treasury Services (including 
Trade Finance, Lending and Corporate Cash Management), Strategic Corporate Lending and Business Banking. Economic 
capital demand in these segments arises largely from credit risk.  

Investment Bank’s risk profile is dominated by its financing and trading activities, which give rise to all major risk types. Credit 
risk in the Investment Bank is broadly distributed across business units but most prominent in Fixed Income & Currencies and 
Leveraged Debt Capital Markets. Market risk arises mainly from trading and market making activities. 

Private Bank’s risk profile comprises credit risks from business with German and international retail clients, business clients 
and wealth management clients as well as non-trading market risks from investment risk, modelling of client deposits and 
credit spread risk. 

Asset Management, as a fiduciary asset manager, invests money on behalf of clients. As such, the main risk drivers are non-
financial.  The  economic  capital  demand  for  market  risk  is  mainly  driven  by  non-trading  market  risks,  which  arise  from 
guaranteed products and co-investments in the funds. 

Corporate  &  Other’s  risk  profile  embeds  a  range  of  different  risk  drivers  including  those  pertaining  to  Treasury,  certain 
corporate items, and legacy portfolios. The economic capital demand mainly comprises of non-trading market risk from interest 
rate risk in Treasury, structural foreign exchange risk, pension risk and equity compensation risk, credit risk from Treasury’s 
investments, strategic risk from tax-related risks and software asset risks and operational risk from legacy portfolios. 

The table below shows Deutsche Bank’s overall risk position as measured by the economic capital demand calculated for 
credit,  market,  operational  and  strategic  risk  for  the  dates  specified.  Deutsche  Bank’s  overall  economic  risk  position  also 
considers diversification benefits across risk types.

As of December 31, 2023, Deutsche Bank’s economic capital demand amounted to € 23.3 billion, which was € 2.4 billion or 
11% higher than € 20.9 billion economic capital demand as of December 31, 2022. This was driven by an increase in market 
risk economic capital demand and a lower diversification benefit across risk types, which was partly offset by a decrease in 
economic capital demand for operational risk.

Risk and capital overview 
Risk profile 

The economic capital demand for market risk totaled to € 8.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, which was € 2.0 billion or 31% 
higher compared to year-end 2022. The increase was mainly driven by the annual recalibration of the model’s distribution 
parameters, a reduction in net short credit spread exposure arising from the Group’s defined benefit pension plan assets, an 
increase in trading inventory to support market making and  client flow in the Global Rates and Credit Trading businesses 
within the Investment Bank and a change in behavioral modelling assumptions of client deposits within the Private Bank. 

The inter-risk diversification benefit of the economic capital demand across credit, market, operational and strategic risk totaled 
to € 3.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, which was € 0.4 billion or 10% lower compared to year-end 2022. This decrease 
was  mainly  driven  by  the  introduction  of  a  compensating  control  for a  shortcoming  in  the  modeling  of  the  operational  risk 
distribution within the diversification calculation. 

The operational risk economic capital usage totaled to € 4.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, which was € 0.1 billion or 2% 
lower than the € 4.7 billion economic capital usage as of December 31, 2022. In line with the development of the Group’s 
RWA for operational risk, the decrease was mainly driven by a more favorable development of Deutsche Bank´s internal loss 
profile feeding into the capital model. A detailed description is provided in section “Operational risk management”.

Risk and capital framework 
Risk management principles 

Risk and capital framework 

Risk management principles 

Deutsche Bank’s business model inherently involves taking risks. Risks can be financial and non-financial and include on and 
off-balance sheet risks. Deutsche Bank’s objective is to create sustainable value in the interests of the company taking into 
consideration  shareholders,  employees  and  other  company  related  stakeholders.  The  risk  management  framework 
contributes to this by aligning planned and actual risk taking with risk appetite as expressed by the Management Board, while 
being in line with available capital and liquidity. 

Deutsche Bank’s risk management framework consists of various components, which include the established internal control 
mechanisms. Principles and standards are set for each component: 

–  Organizational structures must follow the Three Lines of Defense (“3LoD”) model with a clear definition of roles and 

responsibilities for all risk types 

–  The 1st Line of Defense (“1st LoD”) refers to those roles in the Bank whose activities generate risks, whether financial 
or non-financial, and who own and are accountable for these risks. The 1st LoD manages these risks within the defined 
risk appetite, establishes an appropriate risk governance and risk culture, and adheres to the risk type frameworks 
defined by the 2nd Line of Defense (“2nd LoD”) 

–  The 2nd LoD refers to the roles in the Bank who define the risk management framework for a specific risk type. The 
2nd LoD independently assesses and challenges the implementation of the risk type framework and adherence to the 
risk appetite, and acts as an advisor to the 1st LoD on how to identify, assess and manage risks. 

–  The 3rd Line of Defense (“3rd LoD”) is Group Audit, which is accountable for providing independent and objective 
assurance on the adequacy of the design, operating effectiveness and efficiency of the risk management system and 
systems of internal control 

–  Every employee must act as a risk manager consistent with the bank’s risk appetite, risk management standards and 

values 

–  The Management Board approved risk appetite must be cascaded and adhered to across all dimensions of the Group, 

with appropriate consequences in the event of a breach 

–  Risks must be identified and assessed 
–  Risks must be actively managed including appropriate risk mitigation and effective internal control systems 
–  Risks must be measured and reported using accurate, complete and timely data using approved models 
–  Regular stress tests must be performed against adverse scenarios and appropriate crisis response planning must be 

established 

The Group promotes a strong risk culture where every employee must fully understand and take a holistic view of the risks 
which could result from their actions, understand the consequences and manage them appropriately against the risk appetite 
of the bank. The bank expects employees to exhibit behaviors that support a strong risk culture in line with the bank’s Code 
of Conduct. To promote this, Deutsche Bank’s policies require that risks taken (including against risk appetite) must be taken 
into  account  during  the  bank’s  performance  assessment  and  compensation  processes.  This  expectation  continues  to  be 
reinforced  through  communications  campaigns  and  mandatory  training  courses  for  all  DB  employees.  In  addition, 
Management  Board  members  and  senior  management  frequently  communicate  the  importance  of  a  strong  risk  culture  to 
support a consistent tone from the top. 

Deutsche Bank’s risk management and internal control system is described in more detail in Deutsche Bank’s Pillar 3 report 
(specifically in the section “Risk management objectives and policies, Enterprise Risk”). The risk management and internal 
control system also covers sustainability-related objectives (as outlined in the Non-Financial Report 2023, specifically in the 
chapters “Sustainability strategy and implementation” and “Climate risk”). 

The Management Board is of the opinion that a risk management framework and internal control system has been established 
which is, in its entirety, appropriate and effective for the bank’s business model and risk profile.

Risk governance 

Risk governance 

Deutsche  Bank’s  operations  throughout  the  world  are  regulated  and  supervised  by  relevant  authorities  in  each  of  the 
jurisdictions  in  which  the  bank  conducts  business.  Such  regulation  focuses  on  licensing,  capital  adequacy,  liquidity,  risk 
concentration, conduct of business as well as organizational and reporting requirements. The European Central Bank (ECB) 
in connection with the competent authorities of EU countries which joined the Single Supervisory Mechanism via the Joint 
Supervisory  Team  act  in  cooperation  as  Deutsche  Bank’s  primary  supervisors  to  monitor  the  bank’s  compliance  with  the 
German Banking Act and other applicable laws and regulations.  

Several layers of management provide cohesive risk governance: 

–  Deutsche  Bank’s  Supervisory  Board  is  informed  regularly  on  the  risk  situation,  risk  management  and  risk  controlling, 
including reputational risk related items as well as material litigation cases; it has formed various committees to handle 
specific topics (for a detailed description of these committees, please see the “Report of the Supervisory Board”, as well 
as chapter “Supervisory Board” in the “Corporate Governance Report”) 
–  At the meetings of the Risk Committee, the Management Board reports on current and forward-looking risk exposures, 
portfolios, on risk appetite and strategy and on matters deemed relevant for the assessment and oversight of the risk 
situation of Deutsche Bank AG; it also reports on loans requiring a Supervisory Board resolution pursuant to law or the 
Articles of Association; the Risk Committee advises on issues related to the overall risk appetite, aggregate risk position 
and the risk strategy and keeps the Supervisory Board informed of its activities 

–  The Regulatory Oversight Committee, among other responsibilities, monitors the Management Board’s measures that 
promote the company’s compliance with legal requirements, authorities’ regulations and the company’s own policies; it 
also reviews the bank’s codes of conduct and ethics as well as its policy framework, and, upon request, supports the 
Risk Committee in monitoring and analyzing the bank’s legal and reputational risks; the Management Board informs the 
committee about contacts with regulators with a significant relevance for the business activity 

–  The Audit Committee, among other matters, supports the Supervisory Board in monitoring the effectiveness of the risk 
management system, particularly the internal control system and the internal audit system, as well as the Management 
Board’s remediation of deficiencies identified 

–  The Management Board is responsible for managing Deutsche Bank Group in accordance with the law, the Articles of 
Association and its Terms of Reference with the objective of creating sustainable value in the interest of the company, thus 
taking  into  consideration  the  interests  of  the  shareholders,  employees  and  other  company  related  stakeholders;  the 
Management Board is responsible for ensuring a proper business organization, encompassing appropriate and effective 
risk  management,  as  well  as  compliance  with  legal  requirements  and  internal  guidelines;  the  Management  Board 
established the Group Risk Committee as the central forum for review and decision on material risk and capital-related 
topics; the Group Risk Committee generally meets once a week; it has delegated some of its duties to individuals and sub-
committees; the Group Risk Committee and its sub-committees are described in more detail below

Risk and capital framework 
Risk governance 

Risk management governance structure of the Deutsche Bank Group 

The following functional committees are central to the management of risk at Deutsche Bank: 

–  The Group Risk Committee has various duties and dedicated authority, including approval of new or changed material risk 
and capital models and review of the inventory of risks, high-level risk portfolios, risk exposure developments, and internal 
and regulatory Group-wide stress testing results; in addition, the Group Risk Committee reviews and recommends items 
for Management Board approval, such as key risk management principles, the Group risk appetite statement, the Group 
recovery  plan  and  the  contingency  funding  plan,  over-arching  risk  appetite  parameters,  and  recovery  and  escalation 
indicators; the Group Risk Committee also supports the Management Board during Group-wide risk and capital planning 
processes 
–  The  Non-Financial  Risk  Committee  oversees,  governs  and  coordinates  the  management  of  non-financial  risks  in 
Deutsche Bank Group and establishes a cross-risk and holistic perspective of the key non-financial risks of the Group, 
including conduct and financial crime risk; it is tasked to define the non-financial risk appetite tolerance framework, to 
monitor and control the effectiveness of the non-financial risk operating model (including interdependencies between 
business divisions and control functions), and to monitor the development of emerging non-financial risks relevant for 
the Group 

–  The Group Reputational Risk Committee is responsible for the oversight, governance and coordination of reputational 
risk  management  and  provides  for  a  look-back  and  a  lessons  learnt  process;  matters  are  referred  to  the  Group 
Reputational Risk Committee in exceptional circumstances – this may be the case if a matter is declined by the Regional 
Reputational Risk Committee and appealed by the business division, or if the Regional Reputational Risk Committee 
cannot  reach  a  two-thirds  majority  decision;  it  provides  guidance  on  Group-wide  reputational  risk  matters,  including 
communication of sensitive topics, to the appropriate levels of Deutsche Bank Group; the Regional Reputational Risk 
Committees which are sub-committees of the Group Reputational Risk Committee, are responsible for the oversight, 
governance  and  coordination  of  the  management  of  reputational  risk  in  the  respective  regions  on  behalf  of  the 
Management Board 

–  The Enterprise Risk Committee has been established with a mandate to focus on enterprise-wide risk trends, events 
and cross-risk portfolios, bringing together risk experts from various risk disciplines; as part of its mandate, the Enterprise 
Risk  Committee  approves  the  group  risk  inventory,  certain  country  and  industry  threshold  increases,  and  scenario 
design outlines for more severe group-wide stress tests as well as reverse stress tests; it reviews group-wide stress test 
results in accordance with risk appetite, reviews the risk outlook, emerging risks and topics with enterprise-wide risk 
implications; it oversees the climate and environmental risk framework

Risk governance 

–  The Product Governance Committee has the mandate to ensure that there is appropriate oversight, governance and 
coordination of product governance in the Group by establishing a cross-risk and holistic perspective of key financial 
and non-financial risks associated with products and transactions throughout the lifecycle 

–  The Financial Resource Management Council is an ad-hoc governance body, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and 
the Chief Risk Officer, with delegated authority from the Management Board, to oversee financial crisis management at the 
bank; the Financial Resource Management Council provides a single forum to oversee execution of both the contingency 
funding  plan  and  the  Group  recovery  plan;  the  council  recommends  upon  mitigating  actions  to  be  taken  in  a  time  of 
anticipated  or  actual  capital  or  liquidity  stress;  specifically,  the  Financial  Resource  Management  Council  is  tasked  with 
analyzing the bank’s capital and liquidity position, in anticipation of a stress scenario recommending proposals for capital 
and liquidity related matters and overseeing the execution of decisions  

–  The Group Asset & Liability Committee has been established by the Management Board with the mandate to optimize the 
sourcing and deployment of the bank’s balance sheet and financial resources within the overarching risk appetite set by 
the Management Board 

Deutsche  Bank’s  Chief  Risk  Officer,  who  is  a  member  of  the  Management  Board,  has  Group-wide,  supra-divisional 
responsibility  for  establishing  a  risk  management  framework  with  appropriate  identification,  measurement,  monitoring, 
mitigation  and  reporting  of  liquidity,  credit,  market,  enterprise,  model  and  non-financial  risks  (including  operational  and 
reputational); however, frameworks for certain risks are established by other functions as per the business allocation plan.  

The Chief Risk Officer has direct management responsibility for the Chief Risk Office function. Risk management and control 
duties  in  the  Chief  Risk  Office  function  are  generally  assigned  to  specialized  risk  management  units  focusing  on  the 
management of  

–  Specific risk types 
–  Risks within a specific business 
–  Risks in a specific region. 

These specialized risk management units generally handle the following core tasks: 

–  Foster consistency with the risk appetite set by the Management Board and applied to business divisions and their business 

units 

–  Determine and implement risk and capital management policies, procedures and methodologies that are appropriate to the 

businesses within each division 
–  Establish and approve risk limits 
–  Conduct periodic portfolio reviews to keep the portfolio of risks within acceptable parameters 
–  Develop and implement risk and capital management infrastructures and systems that are appropriate for each division 

Chief  Risk  Officers  for  each  business  division  as  well  as  each  region,  having  a  holistic  view  of  the  respective  business, 
challenge and influence the divisional and regional strategies, risk awareness and ownership as well as their adherence to 
risk appetite. 

While  operating  independently  from  each  other  and  the  business  divisions,  the  Finance  and  Risk  functions  have  the  joint 
responsibility to quantify and verify the risk that the bank assumes.

Annual Report 2023 

Risk and capital framework 
Risk and capital plan 

Risk appetite and capacity  

Risk appetite expresses the aggregate level and types of risk that Deutsche Bank is willing to assume to achieve strategic 
objectives, as defined by a set of quantitative metrics and qualitative statements. Risk capacity is defined as the maximum 
level of risk that can be assumed given Deutsche Bank’s capital and liquidity base, risk management and control capabilities, 
and regulatory constraints.  

Risk appetite is an integral element in business planning processes via risk strategy and plan, to promote the appropriate 
alignment of risk, capital and performance targets, while at the same time considering risk capacity and appetite constraints 
from both financial and non-financial risks. Compliance of the plan with risk appetite and capacity is also tested under stressed 
market  conditions.  Top-down  risk  appetite serves as  the  limit for risk-taking  for the  bottom-up  planning from  the  business 
functions.  

The Management Board reviews and approves risk appetite and capacity on an annual basis, or more frequently in the event 
of unexpected changes to the risk environment, with the aim of ensuring that they are consistent with the Group’s strategy, 
business and regulatory environment and stakeholders’ requirements.  

In order to determine risk appetite and capacity, different group level triggers and thresholds on a forward-looking basis are 
set and the escalation requirements for further action are defined. Deutsche Bank assigns risk metrics that are sensitive to 
the material risks to which Deutsche Bank is exposed and which function as indicators of financial health. In addition to that, 
the risk and recovery management framework is linked with the risk appetite framework. 

Reports  relating  to  risk  profile  as  compared  to  Deutsche  Bank’s  risk  appetite and  strategy  and  the  monitoring  thereof  are 
presented regularly up to the Management Board. In the event that desired risk appetite is breached, a predefined escalation 
governance matrix is applied so these breaches are highlighted to the appropriate governance bodies.  

Risk and capital plan  

Strategic and capital plan 

Deutsche  Bank  conducts  annually  an  integrated  strategic  planning  process  which  lays  out  the  development  of  our  future 
strategic direction for the Group and for the business areas. The strategic plan aims to create a holistic perspective on capital, 
funding and risk under risk-return considerations. This process translates long-term strategic targets into measurable short- 
to medium-term financial targets and enables intra-year performance monitoring and management. Thereby the Group aims 
to identify growth options by considering the risks involved and the allocation of available capital resources to drive sustainable 
performance. Risk-specific portfolio strategies complement this framework and allow for an in-depth implementation of the risk 
strategy on portfolio level, addressing risk specifics including risk concentrations.  

The strategic planning process consists of two phases: a top-down target setting and a bottom-up substantiation. 

In a first phase – the top-down target setting – Deutsche Bank’s key targets for profit and loss (including revenues and costs), 
capital supply, capital demand as well as leverage, funding and liquidity are defined and discussed for the group and the key 
business areas. In this process step, the targets for the next five years are based on the global macro-economic outlook and 
the expected regulatory framework. Subsequently, the targets are challenged and approved by the Management Board.  

In a second phase, the top-down targets are substantiated bottom-up by detailed business unit plans, which consist of a month 
by month operative plan for year one; years two and three are planned per quarter and years four and five are annual plans. 
The proposed bottom-up plans are reviewed and challenged by Finance and Risk and are discussed individually with the 
respective business heads. Thereby, the specifics of the business are considered, and concrete targets decided in line with 
the bank’s strategic direction. The bottom-up phase includes the preparation of plans for key legal entities to review local risk 
and capitalization levels. Stress tests complement the strategic plan to consider the resilience of the plan against adverse 
market conditions.  

The resulting Strategic and Capital Plan is presented to the Management Board for discussion and approval. The final plan is 
furthermore presented to the Supervisory Board.

Risk and capital framework 
Risk and capital plan 

The Strategic and Capital Plan is designed to support the Groups’ vision of being a leading German bank with strong European 
roots and a global network and aims to ensure: 

–  Balanced risk adjusted performance across business areas and units 
–  High risk management standards with focus on risk concentrations 
–  Compliance with regulatory requirements 
–  Strong capital and liquidity position 
–  Stable  funding  and  liquidity  strategy  allowing  for  business  planning  within  the  liquidity  risk  appetite  and  regulatory 

requirements 

The Strategic and Capital Planning process allows us to: 

–  set earnings and key risk and capital adequacy targets considering the bank’s strategic focus and business plans 
–  assess our capital adequacy with regard to internal and external requirements (i.e., economic capital and regulatory capital) 
–  apply appropriate stress test analyses’ to assess the impact on capital demand, capital supply and liquidity 

All externally communicated financial targets are monitored on an ongoing basis in appropriate management committees. Any 
projected  shortfall  versus  targets  is  discussed  together  with  potential  mitigating  strategies  with  the  aim  to  ensure  that  we 
remain on track to achieve our targets. Amendments to the strategic and capital plan must be approved by the Management 
Board. Achieving our externally communicated solvency targets ensures that we also comply with the solvency ratio-related 
Group Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) requirements as articulated by our home supervisor.  

In  December  2022,  the  ECB  informed  Deutsche  Bank  of  its  decision  effective  January  1,  2023,  that  the  bank’s  Pillar 2 
requirement changed compared to 2022. This results in ECB’s Pillar 2 requirement to 2.70% of RWA. As of December 31, 
2023, Deutsche Bank needs to maintain on a consolidated basis a CET 1 ratio of at least 11.16%, a Tier 1 ratio of at least 
13.17%  and  a  Total  Capital  ratio  of  at  least  15.84%.  The  CET  1  requirement  comprises  the  Pillar 1  minimum  capital 
requirement  of  4.50%,  the  Pillar  2  requirement  (SREP  add-on)  of  1.52%,  the  capital  conservation  buffer  of  2.50%,  the 
countercyclical buffer of 0.45% and the systemic risk buffer of 0.19% (both subject to changes throughout the year) as well as 
the higher of our G-SII/O-SII buffer of 2.00%. Correspondingly, the Tier 1 capital requirement includes additionally a Tier 1 
minimum capital requirement of 1.50% plus a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.51%, and the Total Capital requirement includes further 
a Tier 2 minimum capital requirement of 2.00% and a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.68%. Also, following the results of the 2023 
SREP, the ECB communicated to Deutsche Bank an individual expectation to hold a further Pillar 2 CET 1 capital add-on, 
commonly referred to as the Pillar 2 guidance. The capital add-on pursuant to the Pillar 2 guidance is separate from and in 
addition to the Pillar 2 requirement. The ECB has stated that it expects banks to meet the Pillar 2 guidance although it is not 
legally binding, and failure to meet the Pillar 2 guidance does not lead to automatic restrictions of capital distributions.  

On  December  11,  2023,  Deutsche  Bank  was  informed  by  the  ECB  of  its  decision  regarding  prudential  minimum  capital 
requirements for 2024 that applies from January 1, 2024, onwards, following the results of the 2023 SREP. The decision set 
ECB’s Pillar 2 requirement to 2.65% of RWA, effective as of January 1, 2024, of which at least 1.49% must be covered by 
CET 1 capital and 1.99% by Tier 1 capital.

Internal capital adequacy assessment process  

Deutsche Bank’s internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) consists of several  well-established components 
which ensure that Deutsche Bank maintains sufficient capital to cover the risks to which the bank is exposed on an ongoing 
basis:  

–  Risk identification and assessment: The risk identification process forms the basis of the ICAAP and results in an inventory 
of risks for the Group; all risks identified are assessed for their materiality; further details can be found in section “Risk 
identification and assessment” 

–  Capital demand/risk measurement: Risk measurement models are applied to quantify the regulatory and economic capital 
demand which is required to cover all material risks except for those which cannot be adequately limited by capital e.g. 
liquidity risk; further details can be found in sections “Risk profile” and “Capital, Leverage Ratio, TLAC and MREL” 

–  Capital supply:  Capital supply quantification refers to the definition of available capital resources to absorb unexpected 
losses;  further  details  can  be  found  in  sections  “Capital,  Leverage  Ratio,  TLAC  and  MREL”  and  “Economic  Capital 
Adequacy” 

–  Risk appetite: Deutsche Bank has established a set of qualitative statements, quantitative metrics and thresholds which 
express the level of risk that Deutsche Bank is willing to assume to achieve strategic objectives; threshold breaches are 
subject to a dedicated governance framework triggering management actions aimed to safeguard capital adequacy; further 
details can be found in sections “Risk appetite and capacity” and “Key risk metrics” 

–  Capital planning: The risk appetite thresholds for capital adequacy metrics constitute boundaries which have to be met in 
the capital plan to safeguard capital adequacy on a forward-looking basis; further details can be found in section “Strategic 
and capital plan” 

–  Stress testing: Capital plan figures are also considered under various stress test scenarios to prove resilience and overall 
viability of the bank; regulatory and economic capital adequacy metrics are also subject to regular stress tests throughout 
the  year  to  constantly  evaluate  Deutsche  Bank’s  capital  position  in  hypothetical  stress  scenarios  and  to  detect 
vulnerabilities under stress; further details can be found in section “Stress testing” 

–  Capital  adequacy  assessment:  Although  capital  adequacy  is  constantly  monitored  throughout  the  year,  the  ICAAP 
concludes with a dedicated annual capital adequacy statement (CAS); the assessment consists of a Management Board 
statement about Deutsche Bank’s capital adequacy, which is linked to specific conclusions and management actions to be 
taken to safeguard capital adequacy on a forward-looking basis 

As part of its ICAAP, Deutsche Bank distinguishes between a normative and economic internal perspective. The normative 
internal perspective refers to a multi-year assessment of the ability to fulfil all capital-related legal requirements and supervisory 
demands on an ongoing basis under a baseline and adverse scenario. The economic internal perspective refers to an internal 
process using internal economic capital demand models and an internal economic capital supply definition. Both perspectives 
focus on maintaining the continuity of Deutsche Bank on an ongoing basis.

Risk and capital framework 
Stress testing 

Stress testing 

Deutsche Bank has implemented a stress test framework to satisfy internal as well as external stress test requirements. The 
internal stress tests are based on in-house developed methods and inform a variety of risk management use cases (risk type 
specific  as  well  as  cross risk).  Internal  stress tests  form  an  integral  part  of  Deutsche Bank’s  risk  management  framework 
complementing  traditional  risk  measures.  The  cross-risk  stress  test  framework,  the  Group  Wide  Stress  Test  Framework 
(GWST), serves a variety of bank management processes, in particular the strategic planning process, the ICAAP, the risk 
appetite framework and capital allocation. Capital plan stress testing is performed to assess the viability of the bank’s capital 
plan in adverse circumstances and to demonstrate a clear link between risk appetite, business strategy, capital plan and stress 
testing. The regulatory stress tests, e.g. the EBA stress test and the US-based CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review) stress tests, are strictly following the processes and methodologies as prescribed by the regulatory authorities.  

Deutsche Bank’s internal stress tests are performed on a regular basis in order to assess the impact of severe economic 
downturns as well as adverse bank-specific events on the bank’s risk profile and financial position. The bank’s stress testing 
framework comprises regular sensitivity-based and scenario-based approaches addressing different severities and regional 
hotspots. All material risk types are included in the stress testing activities. These activities are complemented by portfolio- 
and country-specific downside analysis as well as further regulatory requirements, such as annual reverse stress tests and 
additional  stress  tests  requested  by  regulators  on  group  or  legal  entity  level.  The  applied  methodologies  undergo  regular 
scrutiny from Deutsche Bank’s internal validation team (Model Risk Management) to ensure they correctly capture the impact 
of a given stress scenario.  

The initial phase of Deutsche Bank’s cross-risk stress test consists of defining a macroeconomic downturn scenario by ERM 
Risk Research in cooperation with business specialists through a formal governance forum, the Scenario Design Council. 
ERM Risk Research monitors the political and economic developments around the world and maintains a macro-economic 
heat  map  that  identifies  potentially  harmful  scenarios.  Based  on  quantitative  models  and  expert  judgments,  economic 
parameters such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, GDP growth or unemployment rates are set accordingly and define 
the narrative under which the bank’s solvency position is assessed. The scenario parameters are translated into specific risk 
drivers by subject matter experts in the risk units. Based on the bank’s internal model framework for stress testing, the following 
major metrics are calculated under stress: risk-weighted assets, impacts on profit and loss and economic capital by risk type. 
These results are aggregated at the Group level, and key metrics such as the CET 1 ratio, ECA ratio, MREL ratio and Leverage 
Ratio under stress are derived. Stress impacts on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and other Liquidity indicators are also 
considered. The time-horizon of internal stress tests is between one and five years, depending on the use case and scenario 
assumptions.  The  Stress  Test  Council  (STC)  reviews  the  final  stress  results  followed  by  selected  presentations  to  the 
Enterprise  Risk  Committee  (ERC).  After  comparing  these  results  against  the  bank’s  defined  risk  appetite,  the  ERC  also 
discusses specific mitigation actions to remediate the stress impact in alignment with the overall strategic and capital plan if 
certain limits are breached. The results also feed into the recovery planning which is crucial for the recoverability of the bank 
in times of crisis. The outcome is presented to senior management up to the Management Board to raise awareness on the 
highest  level  as  it  provides  key  insights  into  specific  business  vulnerabilities  and  contributes  to  the  overall  risk  profile 
assessment of the bank.  

The  group  wide  stress  tests  performed  in  2023  indicated  that  the  bank’s  capitalization  together  with  available  mitigation 
measures as defined in the Group Recovery Plan is adequate to reach the internally set stress exit levels.

Risk and capital framework 
Risk measurement and reporting systems 

The cross-risk reverse stress test leverages the GWST framework and is typically performed annually in order to challenge 
Deutsche Bank’s business model by determining scenarios which would cause the bank to become unviable. Such a reverse 
stress  test  is  based  on  a  hypothetical  macroeconomic  scenario  enriched  by  idiosyncratic  events  based  on  the  top  risks 
monitored  by  each  risk  type. Comparing  the non-viability  scenario  to  the  current economic  environment,  the  probability  of 
occurrence of such a hypothetical stress scenario is considered to be extremely low. Given this, it is the bank’s view that its 
business continuity is not at risk. 

As required by ECB, the bank has performed multi-year stress tests as part of the annual strategic planning process for 2023 
using  two  adverse  heatmap  scenarios,  namely  a  “EU  led  hard  landing  scenario”  and  a  “Higher  for  longer  interest  rates” 
scenario.  

In addition to the GWST that includes all material risk types and major revenue streams, Deutsche Bank has individual stress 
test programs in place for all relevant risk metrics in line with regulatory requirements. The relevant stress test programs are 
described in the sections about the individual risk management methods. 

Deutsche Bank also took part in two major regulatory stress tests performed in 2023 i.e. the bi-annual European EBA stress 
test as well as the US-based CCAR stress test, as implemented pursuant to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act. The outcome of the 
EBA  stress  test  is  feeding  into  the  SREP  process  for  Deutsche  Bank.  In  the  CCAR  context,  the  Federal  Reserve  (FRB) 
disclosed  the  stress  capital  depletion  for  DB  USA  Corporation  and  DWS  USA  Corporation;  this  showed  that  each  entity 
remains very well-capitalized even after withstanding a hypothetical severe stress environment.  

Also in 2023, the bank ran an internal climate transition risk stress test across its global portfolios focusing on a near-term 
time horizon (three years) under severe assumption of a front-loaded disorderly transition. The results of the stress test are 
integrated into relevant processes, including risk appetite, business planning and ICAAP. 

Risk measurement and reporting systems  

Overview 

Deutsche  Bank’s  risk  measurement  systems  support  regulatory  reporting  and  external  disclosures,  as  well  as  internal 
management  reporting  across  all  risk  types.  The  risk  infrastructure  incorporates  the  relevant  legal  entities  and  business 
divisions and provides the basis for reporting on risk positions, capital adequacy and limit, threshold, or target utilization to the 
relevant functions on a regular and ad-hoc basis. Established units within the CFO and CRO function assume responsibility 
for measurement, analysis and reporting of risk while promoting sufficient quality and integrity of risk-related data and consider, 
where relevant, the principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting as per the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision's  regulation  number  239  (“BCBS  239”).  The  Group’s  risk  management  systems  are  reviewed  by  Group  Audit 
following a risk-based audit approach. 

Deutsche Bank’s reporting is an integral part of Deutsche Bank’s risk management framework and as such aligns with the 
organizational setup by delivering consistent information on Group level and for material legal entities as well as breakdowns 
by risk types, business division and material business units.  

The following principles guide Deutsche Bank’s “risk measurement and reporting” practices: 

–  Deutsche  Bank  monitors  risks  taken  against  risk  appetite  and  risk-reward  considerations  on  various  levels  across  the 
Group, e.g. Group, business divisions, material business units, material legal entities, risk types, material asset classes, 
portfolio and counterparty levels 

–  Risk reporting is required to be accurate, clear, useful and complete and must convey reconciled and validated risk data to 
communicate information in a concise manner to ensure, across material Financial and Non-Financial Risks, the bank’s 
risk profile is clearly understood 

–  Senior risk committees, such as the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Group Risk Committee, as well as the Management 
Board  who  are  responsible  for  risk  and  capital  management  receive  regular  reporting  (as  well  as  ad-hoc  reporting  as 
required) 

–  Dedicated teams within Deutsche Bank proactively manage material Financial and Non-Financial Risks and must ensure 
that required management information is in place to enable proactive identification and management of risks and avoid 
undue concentrations within a specific Risk Type and across risks (Cross-Risk view) 

In applying the previously mentioned principles, Deutsche Bank maintains a common basis for all risk reports and aims to 
minimize  segregated  reporting  efforts  to  allow  Deutsche  Bank  to  provide  consistent  information,  which  only  differs  by 
granularity and audience focus.

Risk and capital framework 
Risk measurement and reporting systems 

Key risk metrics 

The Bank identifies a large number of metrics within its risk measurement systems which support regulatory reporting and 
external  disclosures,  as  well  as  internal  management  reporting  across  risks  and  for  material  risk  types.  Deutsche  Bank 
designates a subset of those as “Key Risk Metrics” that represent the most critical ones for which the Bank places an appetite, 
limit, threshold or target at Group level and / or are reported routinely to senior management for discussion or decision making. 
The identified Key Risk Metrics include Capital Adequacy and Liquidity metrics; further details can be found in the section 
“Key risk metrics”. 

Key risk reports 

While a large number of reports are used across the Bank, Deutsche Bank designates a subset of these as “Key Risk Reports” 
that are critical to support Deutsche Bank’s Risk Management Framework through the provision of risk information to senior 
management and therefore enable the relevant governing bodies to monitor, steer and control the Bank’s risk taking activities 
effectively. To ensure that Key Risk Reports meet recipients’ requirements, report producing functions regularly check whether 
the Key Risk Reports are clear and useful. 

The main reports on risk and capital management that are used to provide Deutsche Bank’s central governance bodies with 
information relating to the Group risk profile are the following: 

–  The monthly Risk and Capital Profile report is a Cross-Risk report, provides a comprehensive view of Deutsche Bank’s risk 
profile and is used to inform the ERC, the Group Risk Committee as well as the Management Board and subsequently the 
Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board; the Risk and Capital Profile includes Risk Type specific and Business-Aligned 
overviews  and Enterprise-wide  risk  topics;  it  also  includes  updates on  Key  Group Risk  Appetite  Metrics  and  other Key 
Portfolio Risk Type Control Metrics as well as updates on Key Risk Developments, highlighting areas of particular interest 
with updates on corresponding risk management strategies 

–  The Weekly Risk Report is a weekly briefing covering high-level topical issues across key risk areas and is submitted every 
Friday  to  the  Members  of  the  Enterprise Risk  Committee,  the  Group Risk  Committee  and  the  Management  Board  and 
subsequently to the Members of the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board; the Weekly Risk Report is characterized 
by the ad-hoc nature of its commentary as well as coverage of themes and focuses on more volatile risk metrics 

–  Deutsche Bank runs several Group-wide macroeconomic stress tests. A monthly Risk Appetite scenario serves the purpose 
to set and regularly monitor the bank’s stress loss appetite; in addition, there are topical scenarios which are reported to 
and discussed in the Enterprise Risk Committee and escalated to the Group Risk Committee if deemed necessary; the 
stressed key performance indicators are benchmarked against the Group Risk Appetite thresholds 

While the above reports are used at a Group level to monitor and review the risk profile of Deutsche Bank holistically, there 
are other, supplementing standard and ad-hoc management reports, including for Risk Types or Focus Portfolios, which are 
used to monitor and control the risk profile.

Risk and capital framework 
Recovery and resolution planning 

Recovery and resolution planning 

In the EU, the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRM Regulation) and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive 
(BRRD)  aim  at  reducing  the  likelihood  of  another  financial  crisis,  enhance  the  resilience  of  institutions  under  stress,  and 
eventually support the long-term stability of the financial systems without exposing taxpayers’ money to losses. 

In line with the provisions of the SRM Regulation and the BRRD (which were mainly implemented in Germany by the German 
Recovery  and  Resolution  Act  (Sanierungs-  und  Abwicklungsgesetz,  SAG)),  Deutsche  Bank  maintains  a  recovery  and 
resolution planning framework designed to identify and manage the impact of adverse events in a timely and coordinated 
manner. 

The  bank  maintains  a  Group  recovery  plan  specifying  measures  to  restore  the  financial  position  following  a  significant 
deterioration of its financial situation. The Group recovery plan is updated at least annually and approved by the Management 
Board. 

The Group resolution plan on the other hand is prepared by the resolution authorities, rather than by the bank itself. Deutsche 
Bank works closely with the Single Resolution Board and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) who 
establish  the  Group  resolution  plan  for  Deutsche  Bank,  which  is  currently  based  on  a  single  point  of  entry  bail-in  as  the 
preferred resolution strategy. Under the single point of entry bail-in strategy, the parent entity Deutsche Bank AG would be 
recapitalized through a write-down and/or conversion to equity of capital instruments (Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, 
Tier 2) and other eligible liabilities in order to stabilize the Group. Within one month after the application of the bail-in tool to 
recapitalize  an  institution,  the  BRRD  (as  implemented  in  the  SAG)  requires  such  institution  to  prepare  a  business 
reorganization  plan,  addressing  the  causes  of  failure  and  aiming  to  restore  the  institution's  long-term  viability.  To  further 
support  and  improve  operational  continuity  of  the  bank  for  resolution  planning  purposes,  Deutsche  Bank  has  completed 
additional preparations, such as adding termination stay clauses into client financial agreements governed by non-EU law and 
including continuity provisions into key service agreements. Financial contracts and service agreements governed by EU law 
are already covered by statutory laws which prevent termination solely due to any resolution measure. 

The BRRD requires banks in EU member states to maintain minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities to 
make  resolution  credible  by  establishing  sufficient  loss  absorption  and  recapitalization  capacity.  Apart  from  MREL-
requirements, Deutsche Bank, as a global systemically important bank, is subject to global minimum standards for Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity, which set out strict requirements for the amount and eligibility of instruments to be maintained for bail-in 
purposes. In particular, TLAC instruments must be subordinated (including so-called senior non-preferred debt, but also in the 
form of regulatory capital instruments) to other senior liabilities. This ensures that a bail-in would be applied first to equity and 
TLAC  instruments,  which  must  be  exhausted  before  a  bail-in  may  affect  other  senior  (preferred)  liabilities  such  as  senior 
preferred plain vanilla bonds, debt instruments that are structured, deposits and derivatives. 

In  the  United  States,  Deutsche  Bank  AG  is  required  under  Title  I  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street  Reform  and  Consumer 
Protection  Act  of  2010  (the  Dodd-Frank  Act),  as  amended,  to  prepare  and  submit  to  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  and  the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) either a full or targeted resolution plan (the U.S. Resolution Plan) on a timeline 
prescribed  by  such  agencies.  The  U.S.  Resolution  Plan  must  demonstrate  that  the  Deutsche  Bank  AG  has  the  ability  to 
execute and implement a strategy for the orderly resolution of its designated U.S. material entities and operations. For foreign-
based companies subject to these resolution planning requirements such as Deutsche Bank AG, the U.S. Resolution Plan 
relates only to subsidiaries, branches, agencies and businesses that are domiciled in or whose activities are carried out in 
whole or in material part in the United States. Deutsche Bank’s U.S. Resolution Plan describes the single point of entry strategy 
for  Deutsche  Bank’s  U.S.  material  entities  and  operations  and  prescribes  that  DB  USA  Corporation,  one  of  the  bank’s 
intermediate holding companies, would provide liquidity and capital support to its U.S. material entity subsidiaries and ensure 
their solvent wind-down outside of applicable resolution proceedings.  

Deutsche Bank filed its first ‘targeted’ U.S. Resolution Plan on December 17, 2021, which described the core elements of 
Deutsche Bank’s U.S. resolution strategy, such as capital, liquidity, and recapitalization strategies, as well as how Deutsche 
Bank has integrated lessons learned from its response to the COVID-19 pandemic into its resolution planning process. On 
December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC (Agencies) announced the results of their review of Deutsche 
Bank’s  2021  U.S.  Resolution  Plan,  as  well  as  those  of  other  banks,  and  did  not  find  any  shortcomings  or  deficiencies  in 
Deutsche Bank’s plan. In their feedback letter to Deutsche Bank, the agencies noted areas where further progress will help 
improve  resolvability.  Proposed  guidance  was  also  issued  in  August  2023  by  the  Agencies  which  will  amend  resolution 
planning requirements for certain foreign filers, including Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank’s next full resolution plan submission 
is due to be filed by for March 31, 2025.

Resource limit setting 

Risk and Capital Management 

Capital management 

Deutsche Bank’s Treasury function manages solvency, capital adequacy, leverage, and bail-in capacity ratios at Group level 
and locally in each region, as applicable. Treasury implements Deutsche Bank’s capital strategy, which itself is developed by 
the  Group  Risk  Committee  and  approved  by  the  Management  Board.  Treasury,  directly  or  through  the  Group  Asset  and 
Liability Committee, manages, among other things, issuance and repurchase of shares and capital instruments, hedging of 
capital ratios against foreign exchange swings, setting capacities for key financial resources, the design of shareholders’ equity 
allocation, and regional capital planning. The bank is fully committed to maintaining Deutsche Bank’s sound capitalization both 
from an economic and regulatory perspective considering both book equity based on IFRS accounting standards, regulatory 
and  economic  capital  as  well  as  specific  capital  requirements  from  rating  agencies.  The  bank  continuously  monitors  and 
adjusts Deutsche Bank’s overall capital demand and supply to always achieve an appropriate balance. 

Treasury manages the issuance and repurchase of capital instruments, namely Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 capital instruments as well as TLAC/MREL eligible debt instruments. Treasury constantly monitors the market for liability 
management trades. Such trades represent a countercyclical opportunity to create Common Equity Tier 1 capital by buying 
back Deutsche Bank’s issuances below par. 

Treasury manages the sensitivity of Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 ratio and capital towards swings in foreign currency exchange 
rates against the euro. For this purpose, Treasury develops and executes suitable hedging strategies within the constraints of 
a Management Board approved Risk Appetite. Capital invested into Deutsche Bank’s foreign subsidiaries and branches is 
either not hedged, partially hedged or fully hedged. Thereby, Treasury aims to balance effects from foreign exchange rate 
movements  on  capital,  capital  deduction  items  and  risk  weighted  assets  in  foreign  currency.  In  addition,  Treasury  also 
accounts for associated hedge cost and implications on market risk weighted assets.  

Resource limit setting 

Usage of key financial resources is influenced through the following governance processes and incentives.  

Target resource capacities are reviewed in Deutsche Bank’s annual strategic plan in line with Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 and 
Leverage Ratio ambitions. As a part of Deutsche Bank’s quarterly process, the Group Asset and Liability Committee approves 
divisional  resource  limits  for  total  capital  demand  (defined  as  the  sum  of  RWA  and  certain  RWA  equivalents  of  Capital 
Deduction Items and certain RWA equivalents of Capital Buffer Requirements items) and leverage exposure that are based 
on  the  strategic  plan  but  adjusted  for  market  conditions  and  the  short-term  outlook.  Limits  are  enforced  through  a  close 
monitoring process and an excess charging mechanism. 

Overall regulatory capital requirements are principally driven by either Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 ratio (solvency) or leverage 
ratio  (leverage)  requirements,  whichever  is  the  more  binding  constraint.  For  the  internal  capital  allocation,  the  combined 
contribution of each segment to the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, the Group’s Leverage ratio and the Group’s Capital 
Loss under Stress are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint to the Group. Contributions to the 
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the Leverage ratio are measured through RWA and Leverage Ratio Exposure (LRE). The 
Group’s Capital Loss under Stress is a measure of the Group’s overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. 
Goodwill, other intangible assets, and business-related regulatory capital deduction items included in total capital demand are 
directly allocated to the respective segments, supporting the calculation of the allocated tangible shareholders equity and the 
respective rate of return.  

Most of Deutsche Bank’s subsidiaries and several of Deutsche Bank’s branches are subject to legal and regulatory capital 
requirements. In developing, implementing, and testing Deutsche Bank’s capital and liquidity position, the bank fully takes 
such  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  into  account.  Any  material  capital  requests  of  Deutsche  Bank’s  branches  and 
subsidiaries across the globe are presented to and approved by the Group Investment Committee prior to execution. 

Further, Treasury is a member of Deutsche Bank’s Pensions Committee and represented in relevant Investment Committees 
overseeing  the  management  of  the  assets  of  the  largest  Deutsche  Bank  pension  funds  in  Germany.  These  investment 
committees set the investment strategy for these funds in line with the bank’s investment objective to protect the capital base 
and distribution capacity of the bank.

Risk and Capital Management 
Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality 

Risk identification and assessment 

Risks to Deutsche Bank’s businesses and infrastructure functions, including under stressed conditions, are regularly identified. 
This assessment incorporates input from both first and second line of defense, with the identified risks assessed for materiality 
based on their severity and likelihood of materialization. The assessment of risks is complemented by a view on emerging 
risks applying a forward-looking perspective. This risk identification and assessment process results in the risk inventory which 
captures the material risks for the Group, and where relevant, across businesses, entities and branches.  

Regular  updates  to  the  Group  risk  inventory  are  reported  to  the  Enterprise  Risk  Committee  for  review  and  approval.  The 
inventory is also discussed in the Group Risk Committee and reported to the Management Board. The inventory informs key 
risk  management  processes,  including  the  development  of  stress  scenarios  tailored  to  Deutsche  Bank’s  risk  profile  and 
informing risk appetite setting and monitoring. Risks in the inventory are also mapped to risks in the Group risk type taxonomy, 
where a corresponding materiality assessment is also provided. 

Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality  

Credit risk framework 

Credit risk arises from all transactions where actual, contingent or potential claims against any counterparty, borrower, obligor 
or issuer (which Deutsche Bank refers to collectively as “counterparties”) exist, including those claims that Deutsche Bank 
plans to distribute. It captures the risk of loss because of a deterioration of a counterparty’s creditworthiness or the failure of 
a counterparty to meet the terms of any contract with Deutsche Bank or otherwise perform as agreed.  

Based  on  the  Risk  Type  Taxonomy,  credit  risk  is  grouped  into  four  material  categories,  namely  default/migration  risk, 
transaction/settlement risk (exposure risk), mitigation risk and credit concentration risk. This is complemented by a regular risk 
identification and materiality assessment. 

–  Default/migration risk as the main element of credit risk, is the risk that a counterparty defaults on its payment obligations 

or experiences material credit quality deterioration increasing the likelihood of a default 

–  Transaction/settlement risk is the risk that arises from any existing, contingent or potential future positive exposure 
–  Mitigation risk is the risk of higher losses due to risk mitigation measures not performing as anticipated 
–  Credit concentration risk is the risk of an adverse development in a specific single counterparty, country, industry or product 
leading  to  a  disproportionate  deterioration  in  the  risk  profile  of  Deutsche  Bank’s  credit  exposures  to  that  counterparty, 
country, industry or product  

Deutsche Bank manages its credit risk using the following philosophy and principles:  

–  Credit Risk is only accepted: 

–  for adopted clients 
–  after completed appropriate due diligence led by the respective origination teams as 1st LoD 
–  New products and changes to existing products have to be assessed within DB Group’s new product approval (NPA) 

framework 

–  If a Rating has been assigned in line with agreed and approved processes 
–  If all credit relevant exposures are correctly reflected in the relevant risk systems  
–  If plans for an orderly termination of the risk positions have been considered 

–  Credit Risk is assumed within the applicable Risk Appetite limits set for divisions, countries, industries, etc. 
–  P&L responsibility for credit exposures is owned by the originating Group Division 
–  Risk taken needs to be adequately compensated 
–  Risk must be continuously monitored and managed across 1st and 2nd LoD 
–  Credit standards are applied consistently across all Group Divisions in order to maintain a favorable risk profile in line with 

the Risk Appetite 

–  Collateral or other risk mitigating, hedging or rating transfer instruments, which can be an alternative source of repayment 
do not substitute for underwriting standards and a thorough assessment of the debt service ability of a counterparty has to 
be performed during the credit process; essentially rating transfer instruments are supporting documents (e.g., comfort 
letters or parental guarantees) helping the debtor to prevent a default; consequently, this effect can be considered in the 
Probability of Default 

–  Deutsche  Bank  strives  to  adequately  secure,  guarantee  or  hedge  outright  cash  risk  and  longer  tenor-exposures;  this 
approach does usually not include lower risk short-term transactions and facilities supporting specific trade finance or other 
lower risk products where the margin allows for adequate loss coverage

Measuring Credit Risk  

Credit risk is measured by credit rating, regulatory and internal capital demand and other key components like credit limits as 
mentioned below. 

The  credit  rating  is  an  essential  part  of  the  bank’s  underwriting  and  credit  process  and  provides  –  amongst  others  –  a 
cornerstone for risk appetite determination on an individual counterparty level, credit decision and transaction pricing as well 
the determination of regulatory capital demand for credit risk. Each counterparty must be rated, and each rating has to be 
reviewed at least annually supported by ongoing monitoring of counterparties. A credit rating is a prerequisite for any credit 
limit established/ approved. For each credit rating, the appropriate rating approach has to be applied and the derived credit 
rating has to be established in the relevant systems. Specific rating approaches have been established to best reflect the 
respective  characteristics  of  exposure  classes,  including  specific  product  types,  central  governments  and  central  banks, 
institutions, corporates and retail. 

Counterparties in the bank’s non-retail portfolios are rated by Deutsche Bank’s independent Credit Risk Management function 
partly  using  automated  Rating  systems.  Given  the  largely  homogeneous  nature  of  the  retail  portfolio,  counterparty 
creditworthiness and ratings are predominately derived by utilizing an automated decision engine. Country risk-related ratings 
are provided by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Risk Research.  

Deutsche Bank’s rating analysis is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors. When rating a counterparty 
Deutsche Bank applies in-house assessment methodologies, scorecards and the bank’s 21-grade rating scale for evaluating 
the creditworthiness of the bank’s counterparties. 

Changes  to  existing  credit  models  and  introduction  of  new  models  are  approved  by  the  Regulatory  Credit  Risk  Model 
Committee (RCRMC) chaired by the Head of Credit Risk Management before the models are used for credit decisions and 
capital calculation for the first time or before they are significantly changed. Separately, for all model changes and for new 
models an approval by Model Risk Management is required. Proposals with high impact are recommended for approval to the 
Group  Risk  Committee.  Furthermore,  regulatory  approval  may  also  be  required.  The  model  validation  is  performed 
independently of model development by Model Risk Management. The results of the regular validation processes as stipulated 
by internal policies are brought to the attention of the RCRMC, even if the validation results do not lead to a change.  

Deutsche Bank measures risk-weighted assets to determine the regulatory capital demand for credit risk using “advanced”, 
“foundation”  and  “standard”  approaches  of  which  “advanced”  and  “foundation”  approaches  are  approved  by  the  bank’s 
regulator.  

The advanced Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA) is the most sophisticated approach available under the regulatory 
framework for credit risk and allows Deutsche Bank to make use of the bank’s internal credit rating models as well as internal 
estimates of specific further risk parameters. These methods and parameters represent long-used key components of the 
internal  risk  measurement  and  management  process  supporting  the  credit  approval  process,  the  economic  capital  and 
expected  loss  calculation  and  the  internal  monitoring  and  reporting  of  credit  risk.  The  relevant  parameters  include  the 
probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the maturity (M) driving the regulatory risk-weight and the credit 
conversion  factor  (CCF)  as  part  of  the  regulatory  exposure  at  default  (EAD)  estimation.  For  the  majority  of  derivative 
counterparty exposures as well as securities financing transactions (SFT), Deutsche Bank makes use of the internal model 
method (IMM) in accordance with CRR to calculate EAD. For most of the bank’s internal rating systems more than seven 
years of historical information is available to assess these parameters. Deutsche Bank’s internal rating methodologies aim at 
point-in-time rather than a through-the-cycle rating, but in line with regulatory solvency requirements, they are calibrated based 
on long-term averages of observed default rates. 

The foundation IRBA is an approach available under the regulatory framework for credit risk allowing institutions to make use 
of  their  internal  rating  methodologies  while  using  pre-defined  regulatory  values  for  all  other  risk  parameters.  Parameters 
subject to internal estimates include the PD while the LGD and the CCF are defined in the regulatory framework. Foundation 
IRBA remains in place for some exposures stemming from ex-Postbank.

Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality 

Deutsche  Bank  applies  the  standardized  approach  to  a  subset  of  its  credit  risk  exposures.  The  standardized  approach 
measures credit risk either pursuant to fixed risk weights, which are predefined by the regulator, or through the application of 
external ratings. Deutsche Bank assigns certain credit exposures permanently to the standardized approach in accordance 
with  Article  150  CRR.  These  are  predominantly  exposures  to  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  and  other German  public 
sector  entities  as  well  as  exposures  to  central  governments  of  other  European  Member  States  that  meet  the  required 
conditions.  These  exposures  make  up  the  majority  of  the  exposures  carried  in  the  standardized  approach  and  receive 
predominantly a risk weight of zero percent. For internal purposes, however, these exposures are subject to an internal credit 
assessment and fully integrated in the risk management and economic capital processes.  

In addition to the above-described regulatory capital demand, Deutsche Bank determines the internal capital demand for credit 
risk via an economic capital model. 

Deutsche Bank calculates economic capital for the default risk, country risk and settlement risk as elements of credit risk. In 
line with the bank’s economic capital framework, economic capital for credit risk is set at a level to absorb with a probability of 
99.9% very severe aggregate unexpected losses within one year. Deutsche Bank’s economic capital for credit risk is derived 
from  the  loss  distribution  of  a  portfolio  via  Monte  Carlo  Simulation  of  correlated  rating  migrations.  The  loss  distribution  is 
modeled  in  two  steps.  First,  individual  credit  exposures  are  specified  based  on  parameters  for  the  probability  of  default, 
exposure at default and loss given default. In a second step, the probability of joint defaults is modeled through the introduction 
of  economic  factors,  which  correspond  to  geographic  regions  and  industries.  The  simulation  of  portfolio  losses  is  then 
performed by an internally developed model, which takes rating migration and maturity effects into account. Effects due to 
wrong-way derivatives risk (i.e., the credit exposure of a derivative in the default case is higher than in non-default scenarios) 
are modeled by applying the bank’s own alpha factor when deriving the exposure at default for derivatives and securities 
financing  transactions  under  the  CRR.  Deutsche  Bank  allocates  expected  losses  and  economic  capital  derived  from  loss 
distributions down to transaction level to enable management on transaction, customer and business level. 

Besides the credit rating, as a key component for managing the bank’s credit portfolio, including individual transaction approval 
and the setting of risk appetite, Deutsche Bank establishes credit limits for all credit exposures. Credit limits set forth maximum 
credit exposures Deutsche Bank is willing to assume over specified periods. In determining the credit limit for a counterparty, 
Deutsche Bank considers the counterparty’s credit quality above others by reference to its internal credit rating. Credit limits 
and credit exposures are both measured on a gross and net basis where net is derived by deducting appropriate hedges and 
certain collateral from respective gross figures. For derivatives, Deutsche Bank looks at current market values and the potential 
future exposure over the relevant time horizon, which is based upon the bank’s legal agreements with the counterparty. 

IFRS 9 Impairment 

In the following chapter, the Group provides an overview of the IFRS 9 impairment framework and how it is embedded into 
Deutsche Bank‘s credit risk management activities. The disclosure provides a description of the Group‘s IFRS 9 model and 
methodology, changes implemented in 2023 as well as key model assumptions. This chapter also highlights novel risks in 
focus in 2023 and how Deutsche Bank assessed impact of these latest developments on its ECL calculations, and in particular, 
how the model properly takes into account the impacts of the uncertainties noted in 2023 and at year end, along with the 
impact from reasonable changes in the Group’s key model assumptions.  

These  credit  risk  management  activities  and  assessments  are  embedded  in  the  bank’s  overall  control  and  governance 
framework for credit risk which includes the estimation of expected credit losses under IFRS 9 and the governance around 
the models used. These activities include, but are not limited to, regular emerging risk reviews as well as portfolio deep dives, 
day to day risk management on the level of individual borrowers, as well as regular model validations. Further explanations 
are provided regarding management overlays applied to the credit loss allowance, how reviews of relevant assumptions and 
inputs to the ECL calculation are performed and how as part of the model reviews, potential model imprecision and whether 
any overlays were necessary, are assessed. The Group also presents background on management overlays recorded at the 
end of 2022, throughout 2023 and at the end of 2023. To provide additional transparency on the impact of reasonable changes 
to the key assumptions, model sensitivities are presented in a separate section which concludes with the key drivers for the 
IFRS 9 model results.

Description of IFRS 9 Model and Methodology 

The impairment requirements of IFRS 9 apply to all credit exposures that are measured at amortized cost or fair value through 
other  comprehensive  income  and  to  off  balance  sheet  lending  commitments,  such  as  loan  commitments  and  financial 
guarantees. For purposes of the bank’s impairment approach, the Group refers to these instruments as financial assets. 

The Group determines its allowance for credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9 as follows: 

–  Stage 1 reflects financial assets where it is assumed that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition  
–  Stage 2 contains all financial assets, that are not defaulted, but have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since 

initial recognition 

–  Stage 3 consists of financial assets which deemed to be in default in accordance with Deutsche Bank’s policies, which are 
based on the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) Article 178. The Group defines these financial assets as impaired, 
non-performing and defaulted 

–  Significant increase in credit risk is determined using quantitative and qualitative information based on the Group’s historical 

experience, credit risk assessment and forward-looking information 

–  Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired (POCI) financial assets are assets where at the time of initial recognition, there is 

objective evidence of impairment and the Group purchased at a discount. 

The IFRS 9 impairment approach is an integral part of the Group’s credit risk management procedures. The estimation of 
expected credit loss (ECL) is either performed via the automated, parameter based ECL calculation using the Group’s ECL 
model or determined by credit officers. In both cases, the calculation takes place for each financial asset individually. Similarly, 
the determination of the need to transfer between stages is made on an individual asset basis. The Group’s ECL model is 
used to calculate the allowance for credit losses for all financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2, as well as for Stage 3 in the 
homogeneous portfolio (i.e., retail and small business loans with similar credit risk characteristics). For financial assets in the 
bank’s non-homogeneous portfolio in Stage 3 and for POCI assets, the allowance for credit losses is determined individually 
by credit officers. 

The Group uses three main components to measure ECL. These are Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) 
and Exposure at Default (EAD). The Group leverages existing parameters used for determination of capital demand under the 
Basel Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA) and internal risk management practices as much as possible to calculate ECL. 
These parameters are adjusted where necessary to comply with IFRS 9 requirements (e.g., use of point in time ratings and 
removal  of  downturn  add-ons  in  the  regulatory  parameters).  Incorporating  forecasts  of  future  economic  variables  into  the 
measurement of ECL influences the allowance for credit losses. In order to calculate lifetime ECL, the Group’s calculation 
derives the corresponding lifetime PDs from migration matrices that reflect economic forecasts. 

In July 2023, the Group completed the migration of Postbank clients into the IT systems of Deutsche Bank, which resulted in 
a Group-wide alignment of the  IFRS 9 impairment model and methodologies, while specific models previously applied for 
Postbank were decommissioned. This change in estimate resulted in an immaterial net increase in the Group’s allowance for 
credit losses. 

In  September  2023,  the  Group  received  approval  from  authorities  to  align  the  Probability  of  Default  (PD)  model  for  large 
corporates and leveraged lending with regulatory requirements. The model is used for the determination of capital demand 
under the Basel Internal Ratings Based Approach, for internal risk management practices and is leveraged for IFRS 9 ECL 
purposes. The related change in estimate reduced the Group’s ECL as of September 30, 2023, by € 101 million. 

Stage Determination and Significant Increase in Credit Risk 
At initial recognition, financial assets are reflected in Stage 1, unless the financial assets are POCI. If there is a significant 
increase in credit risk, the financial asset is transferred to Stage 2. A significant increase in credit risk is determined by using 
rating-related and process-related indicators. The transfer of financial assets to Stage 3 is based on the status of the borrower 
being in default. If a borrower is in default, all financial assets of the borrower are transferred to Stage 3.  

Rating-related  Stage  2  indicators:  The  Group  compares  a  borrower’s  lifetime  PD  at  the  reporting  date  with  lifetime  PD 
expectations at the date of initial recognition to determine if there has been a significant change in the borrower’s PDs and 
consequently to any of the borrower’s transaction in the scope of IFRS 9 impairment. Based on historically observed migration 
behavior and a sampling of different economic scenarios, a lifetime PD distribution is obtained. A quantile of this distribution, 
which is defined for each counterparty class, is chosen as the lifetime PD threshold. If the remaining lifetime PD of a transaction 
according to current expectations exceeds this threshold, the financial asset is deemed to have incurred a significant increase 
in  credit  risk  and  is  transferred  to  Stage  2.  The  quantiles  used  to  define  Stage  2  thresholds  are  determined  using  expert 
judgment,  are  reviewed  annually  and  have  not  changed  since  implementation  of  IFRS  9.  The  thresholds  applied  vary 
depending  on  the  original  credit  quality  of  the  borrower,  elapsed  lifetime,  remaining  lifetime  and  counterparty  class. 
Management believes that the defined approach and quantiles represent a meaningful indicator that a financial asset has 
incurred a significant increase in credit risk.

Risk and Capital Management 
Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality 

Process-related Stage 2 indicators are derived via the use of existing risk management indicators, which in the bank’s view 
represent situations where the credit risk of financial assets has significantly increased. These include borrowers being added 
to  the  Group’s  watchlist,  being  transferred  to  workout  status,  payments  being  30  days  or  more  past  due  or  being  in 
forbearance. As long as the condition for one or more of the process-related or rating-related indicators is fulfilled and the 
borrower of the financial asset has not met the definition of default, the asset will remain in Stage 2. If the Stage 2 indicators 
are  no  longer  fulfilled  and  the  financial  asset  has  not  defaulted,  the  financial  asset  transfers  back  to  Stage  1.  In  case  of 
performing forborne financial assets, the probation period is 2 years before the financial asset is reclassified to Stage 1, which 
is aligned with regulatory guidance.  

If the borrower defaults, all transactions of the borrower are allocated to Stage 3. If, at a later date, the borrower is no longer 
in  default,  the  curing  criteria  according  to  regulatory  guidance  is  applied  (including  probation  periods),  which  are  at  least 
3 months or 1 year in case of distressed restructurings. Once the regulatory cure period or criteria has been met, the borrower 
will cease to be classified as defaulted and will be transferred back to Stage 2 or Stage 1. 

The ECL calculation for Stage 3 distinguishes between transactions in the homogeneous and non-homogenous portfolios, as 
well  as  POCI  financial  assets.  For  transactions  that  are  in  Stage  3  and  in  a  homogeneous  portfolio,  the  Group  uses  a 
parameter-based automated approach to determine the credit loss allowance per transaction. For these transactions, the LGD 
parameters are to a large extent modelled to be time-dependent, i.e., consider the declining recovery expectation as time 
elapses after default. The allowance for credit losses for financial assets in the bank’s non-homogeneous portfolios in Stage 3, 
as well as for POCI assets are determined by credit officers and have to be approved along an established authority grid up 
to and including the Management Board. This allows credit officers to consider currently available information and recovery 
expectations specific to the borrowers and the financial assets at the reporting date.  

Estimation Techniques for Key Input Factors 
The first key input factor in  the Group ECL calculation is the one-year PD for borrowers which is derived from the bank’s 
internal rating systems. The Group assigns a PD to each borrower credit exposure based on a 21-grade master rating scale 
for all of the Group’s exposure.  

The borrower ratings assigned are derived based on internally developed rating models which specify consistent and distinct 
customer-relevant criteria and assign a rating grade based on a specific set of criteria as given for a certain customer. The set 
of  criteria  is  generated  from  information  sets  relevant  for  the  respective  customer  segments  including  general  customer 
behavior, financial and external data (e.g., credit bureau). The methods in use range from statistical scoring models to expert-
based models taking into account the relevant available quantitative and qualitative information. Expert-based models are 
usually applied for borrowers in the exposure classes “Central governments and central banks”, “Institutions” and “Corporates” 
with the exception of those “Corporates” for which a sufficient data basis is available for statistical scoring models. For the 
latter, as well as for the retail segment, statistical scoring or hybrid models combining both approaches are commonly used. 
Quantitative  rating  methodologies  are  developed  based  on  applicable  statistical  modelling  techniques,  such  as  logistic 
regression. 

One-year PDs are extended to multi-year PD curves using through-the-cycle matrices and macroeconomic forecasts. Based 
on  economic  scenarios  centered  around  the  macroeconomic  baseline  forecast,  through-the-cycle  matrices  are  first 
transformed into point-in-time rating migration matrices, typically for a two-year period. The calculation of the point-in-time 
matrices leverages a link between macroeconomic variables and the default and rating behavior of borrowers, which is derived 
from historical macroeconomic variables (MEVs) and rating time series through regression techniques. In a final step, multi-
year  PD  curves  are  derived  from  point-in-time  rating  migration  matrices  for  periods  where  reasonable  and  supportable 
forecasts are available and extrapolated based on through-the-cycle rating migration matrices beyond those periods. 

The second key input factor into the ECL calculation is the LGD parameter, which is defined as the likely loss intensity in case 
of a borrower’s default. It provides an estimation of the exposure that cannot be recovered in a default event and therefore 
captures the severity of a loss. Conceptually, LGD estimates are independent of a borrower’s probability of default. The LGD 
models applied in Stages 1 and 2, which are based on regulatory LGD models, but adjusted for IFRS 9 requirements (i.e., 
removal of downturn-add-on and removal of indirect costs of workout), ensure that the main drivers for losses (i.e., different 
levels and quality of collateralization and customer or product types or seniority of facility) are reflected as risk drivers in LGD 
estimates. In the bank’s LGD models, the Group assigns collateral type specific LGD parameters to the collateralized exposure 
(collateral value after application of haircuts). The LGD setting for defaulted homogeneous portfolios are partially dependent 
on time after default and are either calibrated based on the Group’s multi-decade loss and recovery experience using statistical 
methods  or  for  less  significant  portfolios  certain  LGD  model  input  parameters  (e.g.,  cure  rates)  are  determined  by  expert 
judgement.

Risk and Capital Management 
Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality 

The third key input factor is the exposure at default over the lifetime of a financial asset which is modelled taking into account 
expected repayment profiles (e.g., linear amortization, annuities, bullet loan structures). Prepayment options are modelled for 
some portfolios. The bank applies specific credit conversion factors (CCFs) in order to calculate an EAD value. Conceptually, 
the EAD is defined as the expected amount of the credit exposure to a borrower at the time of its default. In instances where 
a transaction involves an unused limit, a percentage share of this unused limit is added to the outstanding amount in order to 
appropriately reflect the expected outstanding amount in case of a borrower’s default. This reflects the assumption that for 
commitments, the utilization at the time of default might be higher than the current outstanding balance. In case a transaction 
involves an additional contingent component (i.e., guarantees) a further percentage share is applied as part of the CCF model 
in order to estimate the amount of guarantees drawn in case of default. The calibrations of such parameters are based on 
internal historical data and are either based on empirical analysis or supported by expert judgement and consider borrower 
and product type specifics. Where supervisory CCF values need to be applied for regulatory purposes, internal estimates are 
used for IFRS 9. 

Expected Lifetime  
IFRS 9 requires the determination of lifetime ECL for which the expected lifetime of a financial asset is a key input factor. 
Lifetime ECL represent default events over the expected life of a financial asset. The Group measures ECL considering the 
risk  of  default over the  maximum contractual  period  (including  any  borrower’s  extension  options) over which the  Group  is 
exposed to credit risk.  

Retail overdrafts, credit card facilities and certain corporate revolving facilities typically include both a loan and an undrawn 
commitment component. The expected lifetime of such on-demand facilities exceeds their contractual life as they are typically 
cancelled only when the Group becomes aware of an increase in credit risk. The expected lifetime is estimated by taking into 
consideration historical information and the Group’s credit risk management actions such as credit limit reductions and facility 
cancellation. Where such facilities are subject to an individual review by credit risk management, the lifetime for calculating 
ECL is 12 months. For facilities not subject to individual review by credit risk management, the bank applies a lifetime for 
calculating ECL of 24 months. 

Interest Rate used in the IFRS 9 model 
In the context of the ECL calculation, the Group applies in line with IFRS 9 an approximation of the effective interest rate (EIR), 
which is usually the contractual interest rate. The contractual interest rate is deemed to be an appropriate approximation, as 
the  interest  rate  is  consistently  used  in  the  ECL  model,  interest  recognition  and  for  discounting  of  the  ECL  and  does  not 
materially differ from the EIR. 

Consideration of Collateralization in IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss Calculation 
The ECL model projects the level of collateralization for each point in time in the life of a financial asset. At the reporting date, 
the model uses the existing collateral distribution process applied in Deutsche Bank’s economic capital model. In this model, 
the liquidation value of each eligible collateral is allocated to relevant financial assets to distinguish between collateralized and 
uncollateralized  parts  of  each  financial  asset.  In  the  ECL  calculation,  the  Group  subsequently  applies  the  aforementioned 
LGDs for secured and unsecured exposures to derive the ECL for the secured and unsecured part of the exposure separately. 

For personal collateral (e.g., guarantees), the ECL model assumes that the relative level of collateralization remains stable 
over time. In the case of an amortizing loan, the outstanding exposure and collateral values decrease together over time. For 
physical collateral (e.g., real estate property), the ECL shall assume that the absolute collateral value remains constant. In 
case  of  an  amortizing  loan,  the  collateralized  part  of  the  exposure  increases  over  time  and  the  loan-to-value  decreases 
accordingly. 

Certain financial guarantee contracts are integral to the financial assets guaranteed. In such cases, the financial guarantee is 
considered as collateral for the financial asset and the benefit of the guarantee is used to mitigate the ECL of the guaranteed 
financial asset.

Forward Looking Information 
Under IFRS 9, the allowance for credit losses is based on reasonable and supportable forward-looking information available 
without undue cost or effort, which takes into consideration past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic 
conditions.  

To incorporate forward looking information into the Group’s allowance for credit losses, the bank uses two key elements: 

–  As its base scenario, the Group uses external survey-based macroeconomic forecasts (e.g. consensus views on GDP and 
unemployment rates); in addition, the scenario expansion model, which has been initially developed for stress testing, is 
used for forecasting macroeconomic variables that are not covered by external consensus data; all forecasts are assumed 
to  reflect  the  most  likely  development  of  the  respective  variables;  the  Group  regularly  updates  its  forecasts  for  macro-
economic factors during the quarter and reviews aspects of potential model imprecision (e.g., MEV parameters outside the 
historic range used for model calibration, if not already included in the model) as part of an MEV monitoring framework to 
assess if an overlay is required. 

–  Statistical  techniques  are  then  applied  to  transform  the  base  scenario  projections  into  a  probability  distribution  of  the 
macroeconomic variables; these scenarios specify deviations from the baseline forecasts; the scenario distribution is then 
used for deriving multi-year PD curves for different rating and counterparty classes, which are applied in the ECL calculation 
and in the identification of significant deterioration in credit quality of financial assets as described above in the rating-
related Stage 2 indicators 

The Group's Risk and Finance Credit Loss Provision Forum monitors the impact of forward-looking information, including the 
latest macroeconomic variables, on a quarterly basis and determines if any additional overlays are required. Although interest 
rates and inflation are not separately included in the MEVs, the economic impact of these risks is reflected in GDP growth 
rates,  unemployment,  equities  and  credit  spreads  as  higher  rates  and  inflation  filter  through  these  forecasts.  As  of 
December 31, 2023, the consensus data applied in the ECL model was deemed to have reflected the latest macroeconomic 
developments and after considering all relevant uncertainties in the MEVs no additional overlays were required.  

As described earlier, the Group’s approach to reflect macroeconomic variables in the calculation of ECLs is to incorporate 
forecasts  for  the  next two  years,  using  eight discrete  quarterly  observations. After the  period  of  eight quarters,  the  Group 
constructs forecasts based on macro-economic variables and its historic trends.  

The tables below contain the macroeconomic variables included in the application of forward-looking information in the IFRS 9 
model as of December 31, 2023, and as of December 31, 2022.

Focus areas in 2023 

Deutsche Bank’s macroeconomic environment in 2023 was characterized by the persistently high inflation which drove further 
monetary tightening, risks of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment and generally tighter financial conditions in the major 
advanced  economies.  Towards  the  end  of  the  year,  evidence  of  waning  inflation  pressure  led  to  a  repricing  of  market 
expectations with respect to earlier and more significant central bank rate cuts in 2024 accompanied by an easing of financial 
conditions.  In  addition,  there  were  episodes  of  significant  market  volatility  particularly  around  selective  failures  and/or 
restructurings in the U.S. and European banking sector as well as increasing pressure on the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) 
market, particularly in the U.S. office sector.  

To ensure that Deutsche Bank’s ECL model was taking into account the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment 
throughout 2023, the Group reviewed emerging risks to assess its potential downside and to manage the bank’s credit strategy 
and risk appetite on an ongoing basis. Overall, Deutsche Bank believes the actions taken as a result of these reviews were 
designated to ensure the bank was adequately provisioned for its expected credit losses as of December 31, 2023. 

Commercial Real Estate 
CRE markets continue to face headwinds due to the impacts of higher interest rates, decreasing market liquidity combined 
with tightened lending conditions, and structural changes in the office sector. 

The market stress has been more pronounced in the U.S. where property price indices point to a greater decline of CRE asset 
values from recent peaks compared to Europe and APAC. Similarly, within the office segment, the market weakness is most 
evident in the U.S., reflected in subdued leasing activity and higher vacancy rates compared to Europe.  

In the current environment, the main risk for the portfolio is refinancing risk. CRE loans often have a significant portion of their 
principal amount payable at maturity. Under current market conditions, borrowers may have difficulty obtaining a new loan to 
repay the maturing debt or fulfil conditions to extend the loan. The Group is closely monitoring its CRE portfolio for indications 
of elevated refinancing risk.  

Amidst interest rate hikes commencing in 2022 and real estate market stress increasing, the Group has proactively worked 
with borrowers to address upcoming maturities to establish terms for loan amendments and extensions (e.g. extensions of 
terms) which in many cases, are classified as forbearance triggering Stage 2 classification under IFRS, but are not always 
modifications according under IFRS. However, in certain cases, no agreement can be reached on loan extensions or loan 
amendments, and the borrower’s inability to obtain refinancing leads to a default. This has resulted in higher Stage 3 ECL for 
2023 compared to 2022, and there is continued uncertainty with respect to future defaults and the timing of a recovery in the 
CRE markets. 

The CRE portfolio consists of lending arrangements originated across various parts of the Group and client segments. The 
Group’s  CRE  portfolio  under  the  Group’s  CRE  definition  includes  exposures  reported  under  the  Main  Credit  Exposure 
Categories by Industry Sectors for Real Estate Activities NACE but also exposures reported under other NACE classifications 
including Financial and Insurance Activities. 

Within the CRE portfolio, the Group differentiates between recourse and non-recourse financing. Recourse CRE financings 
typically have a lower inherent risk profile based on recourse to creditworthy entities or individuals, in addition to mortgage 
collateral. Recourse CRE exposures range from secured recourse lending for business or commercial properties to property 
companies, Wealth Management clients, as well as other private and corporate clients. 

Non-recourse financings rely on sources of repayment that are typically limited to the cash flows generated by the financed 
property  and  the  ability  to  refinance  such  loans  may  be  constrained  by  the  underlying  property  value  and  income  stream 
generated by such property at the time of refinancing. 

The entire CRE loan portfolio is subject to periodic stress testing under Deutsche Bank’s Group Wide Stress Test Framework. 
In addition, Deutsche Bank uses bespoke portfolio stress testing for certain sub-segments of the CRE loan portfolio to obtain 
a more comprehensive view of potential downside risks. For the year ending December 31, 2023, the Group performed a 
bespoke portfolio stress test on a subset of the non-recourse financing portfolio deemed higher risk based on its heightened 
sensitivity  to  current  CRE  market  stress  factors,  including  higher  interest  rates,  declining  collateral  values  and  elevated 
refinancing risk due to loan structures with a high proportion of their outstanding principal balance payable at maturity.

As of December 31, 2023, the non-recourse portfolio subject to bespoke portfolio stress testing, also referred to as the higher 
risk  CRE  portfolio  or  the  stress-tested  CRE  portfolio,  amounted  to  € 31.2 billion  of  the  € 38.2 billion  non-recourse  CRE 
portfolio, excluding only sub-portfolios with less impacted risk drivers such as data centers and municipal social housing, which 
benefit from strong underlying demand fundamentals. The reduction in the non-recourse CRE portfolio and stress-tested CRE 
portfolio since December 31, 2022 was € 0.7 billion and € 1.2 billion, respectively, mainly driven by paydowns and loan sales. 
The  reduction  in  the  non-recourse CRE  portfolio  in  comparison  to  the  stress-tested  CRE  portfolio was  lower,  as  selective 
originations continued in the aforementioned lower risk non-recourse CRE sub-portfolios such as data centers and municipal 
social housing.  

The following table provides an overview of the Group’s Real Estate Activities and other industry sectors (NACE) contributing

The average LTV in the U.S. office loan segment was 81% as of December 31, 2023 versus 60% as of December 31, 2022. 
LTV  calculations  are  based  on  latest  externally  appraised  values  which  are  additionally  subject  to  regular  interim internal 
adjustments.  While  the  Group  is  updating  CRE  collateral  values  where  applicable,  such  values  and  their  underlying 
assumptions are subject to a higher degree of fluctuation and uncertainty in the current environment of heightened market 
volatility and reduced market liquidity. A continuation of the current stressed market conditions could have a further adverse 
impact on commercial real estate property values and LTV ratios. 

Stage classification and provisioning levels are primarily based on the Group’s assessment of a borrower’s ability to generate 
recurring  cash  flows,  its  ability  to  obtain  refinancing  at  the  loan’s  maturity,  and  an  assessment  of  the  financed  property’s 
collateral value. Deutsche Bank actively monitors these factors for potential signs of deterioration to ensure timely adjustment 
of  the  borrower’s  loan  classifications.  When  a  loan  is  deemed  to  be  impaired,  the  Group  calculates  required  credit  loss 
provisions  using  multiple  potential  scenarios  for  loan  resolution,  weighted  by  their  expected  probabilities  and  taking  into 
account information available at that point. Such assessments are inherently subjective with respect to scenario weightings 
and subject to various assumptions, including future cash flows generated by a property and potential property liquidation 
proceeds. These assumptions are subject to uncertainties which are exacerbated in the current volatile market environment 
such  that  deviating  developments  to  initial  assumptions  could  have  a  material  future  impact  on  calculated  provisions. 
Additional uncertainty exists within the office sector due to the uncertain long-term impact of remote working arrangements on 
demand for office space.  

Given the near-term outlook for interest rates, the Group expects stressed market conditions to continue into 2024 which could 
result in further deterioration of asset quality and higher credit loss provisions, which is reflected in the communicated guidance 
on credit loss provisions for 2024.

Risk and Capital Management 
Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality 

Since the onset of the CRE market deterioration, the Group aims to assess the downside risk of additional credit losses in its 
higher risk non-recourse portfolio through a temporary bespoke stress testing focused on stressing property values as main 
driver  of  loss  severity.  Stressed  values  are  derived  by  applying  an  observed  peak-to-trough  market  index  decline  (a 
commercial property value market index to the appraised values) plus an additional haircut, differentiated by property type 
and region. Implying a liquidation scenario, the stress analysis assumes a loss to occur on a loan when the stressed property 
value is less than the outstanding loan balance, i.e., the stress LTV beyond 100%. For the stress analysis performed as of 
December 31, 2023 the Group applied haircuts ranging from 3%-18% on top of the observed peak-to-trough market index 
decline for each property type. Driven by further deterioration of market conditions especially in the U.S. office sector, the 
index decline in the fourth quarter increased further compared to the prior quarter.  

Based on the stress test assumptions and utilizing the December 31, 2023 stress-tested CRE portfolio of € 31.2 billion as 
jump-off point, the stress scenario could result in approximately € 1.1 billion of credit losses over multiple years based on the 
respective maturity profile. The stress loss is reported gross of allowance, however, it should be noted that it covers a portfolio, 
where the Group has already a credit loss allowance in place. Nevertheless, the stress loss under a liquidation scenario could 
exceed the current ECL estimate. 

The bespoke stress test has numerous limitations, including but not limited to lack of differentiation based on individual asset 
performance,  specific  location  or  asset  desirability,  all  of  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  potential  stress  losses. 
Furthermore,  calculated  stress  losses  are  sensitive  to  potential  further  deterioration  of  peak-to-trough  index  values  and 
assumptions about incremental haircuts, incremental stress loss can therefore change going forward. Changes in underlying 
assumptions could lead to a wider range of stress results and hence the Group's bespoke stress approach is one of multiple 
scenarios. 

Based on currently available information, Deutsche Bank believes that the ECL estimate related to the Group’s CRE portfolio 
is within reasonable ranges, requires no additional corrective measure and thus represents the bank’s best estimate. However, 
the  Group  remains  highly  selective  around  new  business,  focusing  on  more  resilient  property  types  such  as  industrial  or 
logistics.  

Overall Assessment of ECL’s 
To ensure that Deutsche Bank’s ECL model accounted for the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment throughout 
2023, the Group continued to review emerging risks, assessed potential baseline and downside impacts and required actions 
to manage the bank’s credit strategy and risk appetite. The outcome of these reviews concluded that the bank adequately 
provisioned for its expected credit losses as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. 

Results from the above reviews and development of key portfolio indicators are regularly discussed at the Credit Risk Appetite 
and Management Forum and Group Risk Committee. Where necessary, actions and measures are taken to mitigate the risks. 
Client ratings are regularly reviewed to reflect the latest macroeconomic developments and where potentially significant risks 
are identified clients are moved to the watchlist (Stage 2), forbearance measures may be negotiated, and credit limits and 
collateralization are reviewed. Overall, the Group believes that based on its day-to-day risk management activities and regular 
reviews of emerging risks it has adequately provided for its ECL. 

However, the section below further considers whether any additional overlays were required as of year end 2023. 

Management overlays applied to the IFRS 9 model output 

The  Group  regularly  reviews  the  IFRS  9  methodology  and  processes,  key  inputs  into  the  ECL  calculation  and  discusses 
upcoming model changes, potential model imprecisions or other estimation uncertainties, for example in the macroeconomic 
environment to determine if any material overlays are required.  

In 2023 the € 92 million overlay related to parameter recalibrations required due to the new definition of default has been 
released (which at first application led to a decrease of Allowance for Credit Losses). This overlay was introduced in 2021, 
when the Group implemented the new definition of default which is the trigger for Stage 3. The implementation of the new 
definition of default mainly affected the Private Bank, where the Stage 3 population in homogeneous portfolios increased. As 
the change in definition does not materially impact the total loss expectation of these portfolios, this change resulted in an 
overstatement of Stage 3 provisions as related PD and LGD parameters were not updated in the model.  

The envisaged PD and LGD recalibrations took place in the second half of 2023 after additional empirical data was available 
to enable the statistical recalibration and led to the expected parameter updates. The overall net recalibration effect including 
offsetting impact from the release of the overlay amounted to € 15 million.

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Risk and Capital Management 
Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality 

For year end 2022, the Group recorded overlays amounting to in total € (92) million (which led to an decrease of Allowance 
for Credit Losses) versus € 84 million for year end 2023 (which led to an increase of Allowance for Credit Losses), mainly in 
relation to envisaged ECL model changes planned for implementation in the second quarter of 2024. 

In assessing whether the Group requires any additional overlays, it regularly reviews for evolving or emerging risks, especially 
in the current geopolitical environment. Similar to the measures included above in the Focus areas in 2023, these measures 
include client surveys and interviews, along with analysis of portfolios across businesses, regions and sectors. In addition, the 
Group regularly reviews and validates key model inputs and assumptions (including those in feeder models) and ensures 
where expert judgement is applied, it is in line with the Group’s risk management framework. As of December 31, 2023, the 
Group  did  not  identify  any  model  weaknesses  that  would  require  an  additional  overlay,  except  for  the  ECL  model  related 
changes, for which overlays have been recorded. 

Model Sensitivity 

The  Group  has  identified  three  key  model  assumptions  included  in  the  IFRS  9  model.  These  include  forward  looking 
macroeconomic variables, the quantitative criteria for determining if a borrower has incurred a significant increase in credit 
risk and transferred to Stage 2, and the LGD setting on homogenous portfolios in Stage 3. Below the bank provides sensitivity 
analysis on the potential impact if these key assumptions applied in the ECL model were to deviate from the bank’s base case 
expectations. 

Macroeconomic Variables 
The sensitivity of the ECL model with respect to potential changes in projections for key MEVs is shown in the tables below, 
which provides ECL impacts for Stages 1 and 2 from one sigma downward and upward shifts applied separately to each group 
of  MEV  as  of  December  31,  2023,  and  December  31,  2022.  A  sigma  shift  is  a  standard  deviation  used  in  statistics  and 
probability calculations and is a measure of the dispersion of the values of a random variable. Each of these groups consists 
of MEVs from the same category: 

–  GDP growth rates: includes USA, Eurozone, Germany, Italy, Developing Asia, Emerging Markets 
–  Unemployment rates: includes USA, Eurozone, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain 
–  Equities: S&P500, Nikkei, MSCI Asia 
–  Credit spreads: ITX Europe 125, High Yield Index, CDX IG, CDX High Yield, CDX Emerging Markets 
–  Real Estate: Commercial Real Estate Price Index 
–  Commodities: WTI oil price, Gold price 

Although interest rates and inflation are not separately included in the MEVs above, the economic impact of these risks is 
reflected in other macroeconomic variables, such as GDP growth rates, unemployment, equities and credit spreads as higher 
rates and inflation would filter through these forecasts and be included in the ECL model and sensitivity analysis below. 

In addition, the sensitivity analysis only includes the impact of the aggregated MEV group (i.e., potential correlation between 
different MEV groups or the impact of management overlays is not taken into consideration). ECLs for Stage 3 are not affected 
and not reflected in the following tables as its calculation is independent of the macroeconomic scenarios. 

Sensitivity impact is lower as of December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, due to portfolio changes and minor 
improvements of base MEV projections which the analyses were based on.

At  the  divisional  level,  the  sensitivity  analysis  below  was  performed  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  and  2022, 
respectively,  and  revealed  GDP  growth  rates,  credit  spreads  and  commodities  prices  to  be  the  dominant  factors  for  the 
Investment Bank, whereas the model sensitivity for the Corporate Bank and Private Bank is mainly associated with changes 
in GDP growth rates and unemployment rates. The model sensitivity table for the Private Bank shows GDP growth rates and 
unemployment rates only, as the key MEVs relevant to the underlying portfolios.

Impact of Lifetime Expected Credit Losses for Stage 1 borrowers 
As described above, the Group uses a mixture of quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine significant increase in credit 
risk which require, for affected borrowers, a move to lifetime ECL (Stage 2). If for all Stage 1 borrowers Deutsche Bank were 
to record lifetime expected credit losses, the Group’s allowance for credit losses amounting to € 5.7 billion as of December 31, 
2023 and € 5.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 would increase by approximately 38% as of year end 2023 and as of year-
end 2022, respectively. 

Stage 3 LGD setting 
The Group’s allowance for credit losses in Stage 3 for the homogeneous portfolios amounts to € 2.2 billion as of December 31, 
2023 and € 1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The key driver in determining the ECL provision is the loss given default 
estimate, which differs by individual portfolios. Loss given default is influenced by recovery rates, proceeds from the sale of 
collateral, and cure rates. Some of the drivers for different portfolios include elements of expert judgment and in particular on 
expected cure rates. If the LGD for all homogeneous portfolios were to increase by 1%, then Stage 3 ECL would increase as 
of December 31, 2023 by approximately € 22 million (thereof € 14 million in Germany, € 5 million in Italy and € 2 million in 
Spain), and by approximately € 19 million as of December 31, 2022 (thereof € 11 million in Germany, € 5 million in Italy and 
€ 2 million in Spain).

IFRS 9 Model results 

In 2023, provision for credit losses was € 1.5 billion, compared to € 1.2 billion recorded for the year ended 2022. The increase 
is reflecting an overall weakened macroeconomic environment with only slow recovery of the main economies after Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as well as increased challenges for the Commercial Real Estate sector especially in the office 
space which was already affected by a post-Covid driven change in demand. This sector came under further pressure by 
monetary  measures  imposed  by  the  central  banks  in  reply  to  increased  inflation  which  subsequently  led  to  increased 
refinancing risks.  

The total provisions in 2023 include a € 51 million release related to clients in Russia and Ukraine as a result of successful 
de-risking activities compared to a € 114 million increase in 2022.  

In 2023, € 33 million releases of provision for credit losses related to Stage 1 and 2 and € 1.5 billion new provision for credit 
losses to Stage 3, this compares to € 204 million provisions of Stage 1 and 2 provisions and € 1.0 billion in Stage 3 in 2022. 
The  reduction  of  Stage  1  and  2  provisions  was  primarily  driven  by  the  improvement  and  stabilization  of  macroeconomic 
parameters after the macroeconomic outlook significantly deteriorated in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well 
as benefits from a one-time model change. The increase of Stage 3 provisions was affecting all businesses but primarily the 
Private Bank and the Investment Bank. 

Corporate Bank recorded provision for credit losses of € 266 million in 2023 versus a € 335 million in 2022. The year on year 
decrease was primarily driven by Stage 1 and 2 releases in 2023 compared to charges observed in 2022 following an improved 
macro-economic  outlook  and  benefits  from  model  related  changes.  This  was  partly  offset  by  moderately  higher  Stage 3 
provisions compared to the prior year across various portfolios. The Investment Bank recorded an increase of provision for 
credit losses of € 431 million in 2023 versus € 319 million in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by an increased number 
of impairments primarily in Commercial Real Estate. The Private Bank recorded an increase of provisions for credit losses of 
€ 783 million in 2023 versus € 583 million reported in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by Stage 3 provisions in the first 
quarter of 2023 due to single name cases in Wealth Management and in the fourth quarter 2023 due to the reversal of the 
€ 92 million overlay related to parameter recalibrations required due to the new definition of default introduced in 2021. 

The amounts recognized in the allowance for credit losses in relation to climate-related risks are deemed to be immaterial at 
the end of December 31, 2022, and as of December 31, 2023.

and Critical Accounting Estimates of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Exposure to Russia 

Deutsche  Bank  continues  to  have  limited  exposure  to  Russia.  The  following  table  provides  an  overview  of  total  Russian 
exposures, including overnight deposits with the Central Bank of Russia in the amount of € 0.6 billion as of December 31, 
2023  (€ 0.8 billion  as  of  December  31,  2022)  and  other  receivables,  which  are  subject  to  IFRS  9  impairment,  and 
correspondent allowance for credit losses by stages as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.

Total exposure of € 1.2 billion (€ 1.7 billion as of December 31, 2022) consists of € 0.5 billion (€ 0.8 billion as of December 31, 
2022) loan exposure to Russia, € 26 million (€ 78 million as of December 31, 2022) of undrawn commitments and € 0.6 billion 
(€ 0.8 billion as of December 31, 2022) of unsecured overnight deposits in Rubles with the Central Bank of Russia (which 
continues to be reflected in Stage 2 as of December 31, 2023); the residual unsecured exposure, excluding the unsecured 
overnight deposits in Rubles with the Central Bank of Russia, is mainly driven by loans with large Russian companies. Not 
included in these exposures are Deutsche Bank’s interests in its Russian consolidated entities. This disclosure should be read 
in conjunction with the section “Risk and Opportunities” in this Annual Report.

Financial assets at amortized cost subject to impairment decreased by € 24 billion or 3% in 2023, driven by stage 1: 

Stage 1 exposures declined by € 35 billion or 5%, primarily due to a reduction in cash and central bank balances and loans at 
amortized cost.  

Stage 2 exposures increased by € 10 billion or 23% across business divisions, largely driven by loans at amortized cost. 

Stage 3 exposures went up by € 1 billion or 10% in 2023, mainly driven by new defaults of single large clients in Private Bank 
as well as within the CRE portfolio in Investment Bank.

Financial assets at amortized cost subject to impairment increased by € 16 billion or 2% in 2022, largely driven by stage 1: 

Stage 1 exposures increased by € 11 billion or 2%, primarily due to the increases in debt securities held to collect as well as 
loans at amortized cost in Investment Bank and Private Bank, partly offset by a reduction in central bank balances.  

Stage  2  exposures  increased  by  € 5 billion  or  12%,  largely  driven  by  loans  at  amortized  cost  in  Private  Bank  due  to  the 
deterioration of the macroeconomic environment. 

Stage 3 exposures slightly decreased by € 203 million or 2% in 2022, driven by reductions in Private Bank and the POCI loan 
portfolio. This was partly offset by an increase in Corporate Bank due to new defaults.

1  Movements in financial assets including new business, transfers due to changes in creditworthiness and changes in models add up to Provision for Credit Losses excluding 

country risk 

2  Allowance for credit losses does not include allowance for country risk amounting to € 4 million as of December 31, 2023  
3  This position includes charge offs of allowance for credit losses 
4  The total amount of undiscounted expected credit losses at initial recognition on financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired initially recognized during the 

reporting period was € 0 million in 2023 and € 46 million in 2022 

Allowance for credit losses for financial assets at amortized cost subject to impairment went up by € 291 million or 6% in 2023, 
driven by stage 3: 

Stage 1 allowances decreased by € 86 million or 16% across business divisions, driven by non-recurring positive ECL model 
changes and an improved macroeconomic outlook.  

Stage 2 allowances increased by € 54 million or 9% across business divisions, due to the aforementioned overlays mainly 
related to envisaged ECL model changes (Forward Looking Information on LGDs), which led to an increase of Allowance for 
Credit Losses. 

Stage 3 allowances increased by € 323 million or 8%, mainly driven by the new provisions and the release of the existing 
overlay  related  to  parameter  recalibrations  required  due  to  the  new  definition  of  default  in  Private  Bank  (which  at  first 
application led to a decrease of Allowance for Credit Losses), as mentioned above.  

The Group’s stage 3 coverage ratio (defined as allowance for credit losses in stage 3 (excluding POCI) as a percentage of 
financial assets at amortized cost in stage 3 (excluding POCI)) amounted to 31% in the current fiscal year, compared to 32% 
in the prior year. 

Due to the non-recurring positive ECL model changes, net transfers into stage 1 due to changes in creditworthiness increased 
in 2023 on a year-over-year basis. Net outflows from stage 2 due to changes in creditworthiness increased in 2023, which 
was mainly due to the improved macroeconomic environment, as mentioned above. 

In 2023, net outflows from stage 3 (excluding POCI) increased compared to 2022. The immaterial amount of net outflows from 
stage 3 due to creditworthiness in 2023 resulted from a release of an overlay, as mentioned above.

In 2023, collateral and guarantees held against financial assets at amortized cost in stage 3 increased by € 1 billion, or 21% 
mainly driven by Investment Bank and Private Bank. 

Due to full collateralization the Group did not recognize an allowance for credit losses against financial assets at amortized 
cost in stage 3 for € 408 million in 2023 and € 916 million in 2022. 

Modified Assets at Amortized Cost  
A financial asset is considered modified when its contractual cash flows are renegotiated or otherwise modified. Renegotiation 
or modification may or may not lead to derecognition of the old and recognition of the new financial instrument. This section 
covers modified financial assets that have not been derecognized.  

Under  IFRS  9,  when  the  terms  of  a  Financial  Asset  are  renegotiated  or  modified  and  the  modification  does  not  result  in 
derecognition, a gain or loss is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash 
flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR). For modified financial assets the 
determination of whether the asset’s credit risk has increased significantly reflects the comparison of: 

–  The remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) at the reporting date based on the modified terms; with 
–  The remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data at initial recognition and based on the original contractual terms. 

The following table provides the overview of modified financial assets at amortized cost in the reporting periods broken down 
into IFRS 9 stages.

modifications, driven by a single large client in Private Bank and the CRE portfolio in Investment Bank and Corporate Bank. 
The latter were granted with no modification loss.  

In 2023, the Group has not observed any amounts of modified assets that have been upgraded to stage 1. The bank has not 
observed any subsequent re-deterioration of those assets into stages 2 and 3. 

In 2022, the Group has observed immaterial amounts of modified assets that have been upgraded to stage 1. The bank has 
not observed any subsequent re-deterioration of those assets into stages 2 and 3.  

Financial Assets at Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income 

The fair value of financial assets at Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) subject to impairment under 
IFRS 9 was € 36 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to € 32 billion at December 31, 2022. Allowance for credit losses 
against these assets remained at very low levels (€ 48 million as of December 31, 2023 and € 69 million as of December 31, 
2022). Due to immateriality no further breakdown is provided for financial assets at FVOCI.

Legal Claims 

Assets  subject  to  enforcement  activity  consist  of  assets,  which  have  been  fully  or  partially  written  off  and  the  Group  still 
continues to pursue recovery of the asset. Such enforcement activity comprises for example cases where the bank continues 
to devote resources (e.g. our Legal Department/CRM workout unit) towards recovery, either via legal channels or third party 
recovery agents. Enforcement activity also applies to cases where the Bank maintains outstanding and unsettled legal claims. 
This is irrespective of whether amounts are expected to be recovered and the recovery timeframe. It may be common practice 
in certain jurisdictions for recovery cases to span several years. 

Amounts outstanding on financial assets that were written off during the reporting period and are still subject to enforcement 
activity  amounted  to  € 334 million  in  fiscal  year  2023,  mainly  in  Corporate  Bank.  In  2022,  legal  claims  amounted  to 
€ 175 million, mainly in Corporate Bank and Private Bank. 

Renegotiated and forborne assets at amortized costs  
For economic or legal reasons the bank might enter into a forbearance agreement with a borrower who faces or will face 
financial difficulties in order to ease the contractual obligation for a limited period of time. A case-by-case approach is applied 
for corporate clients considering each transaction and client-specific facts and circumstances. For consumer loans the bank 
offers forbearances for a limited period of time, in which the total or partial outstanding or future instalments are deferred to a 
later point of time. However, the amount not paid including accrued interest during this period must be re-compensated at a 
later  point  of  time.  Repayment  options  include  distribution  over  residual  tenor,  a  one-off  payment  or  a  tenor  extension. 
Forbearances are restricted and depending on the economic situation of the client, the Group’s risk management strategies 
and  the  local  legislation.  In  case  a  forbearance  agreement  is  entered  into,  an  impairment  measurement  is  conducted  as 
described below, an impairment charge is taken if necessary and the loan is subsequently recorded as impaired.  

In  the  Group’s  management  and  reporting  of  forborne  assets  at  amortized  costs,  the  bank  follows  the  EBA  definition  for 
forbearances and non-performing loans (Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on Supervisory reporting on forbearance 
and non-performing exposures under article 99(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013). Once the conditions mentioned in the 
ITS are met, the Group reports the loan as being forborne; removes the asset from the bank’s forbearance reporting, once the 
discontinuance criteria in the ITS are met (i.e., the contract is considered as performing, a minimum two year probation period 
has passed, regular payments of more than an insignificant aggregate amount of principal or interest have been made during 
at least half of the probation period, and none of the exposures to the debtor is more than 30 days past-due at the end of the 
probation period).

Forborne assets at amortized cost increased by € 1.3 billion, or 12% in 2023. This was driven by the increase in Investment 
Bank. 

Forborne assets at amortized cost decreased by € 2.6 billion, or 19% in 2022. This was driven by the reduction in the COVID-
19 related forbearance measures, which was partly offset by an increase in Investment Bank and Corporate Bank.

Collateral Obtained 

The  Group  obtains  collateral  on  the  balance  sheet  only  in  certain  cases  by  either  taking  possession  of  collateral  held  as 
security or by calling upon other credit enhancements. Collateral obtained is made available for sale in an orderly fashion or 
through public auctions, with the proceeds used to repay or reduce outstanding indebtedness. Generally, the bank does not 
occupy obtained properties for its business use.

1  Carrying amount of foreclosed residential real estate properties amounted to € 30 million as of December 31, 2023 and € 62 million as of December 31, 2022 

The collateral obtained, as shown in the table above, excludes collateral recorded as a result of consolidating securitization 
trusts under IFRS 10. In 2023 and 2022, the Group obtained € 0 million of collateral related to these trusts. 

Derivatives – Credit Valuation Adjustment 

The bank establishes counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) for OTC derivative transactions to cover expected credit 
losses. The adjustment amount is determined by assessing the potential credit exposure to a given counterparty and taking 
into account any collateral held, the effect of any relevant netting arrangements, expected loss given default and the credit 
risk, based on available market information, including CDS spreads. 

Treatment of default situations under derivatives 

Unlike standard loan assets, the bank generally has more options to manage the credit risk in its derivatives transactions when 
movement in the current replacement costs or the behavior of its counterparty indicate that there is the risk that upcoming 
payment obligations under the transactions might not be honored. In these situations, the bank is frequently able under the 
relevant derivatives agreements to obtain additional collateral or to terminate and close-out the derivative transactions at short 
notice. 

The master agreements and associated collateralization agreements for OTC derivative transactions executed with its clients 
typically result in the majority of its credit exposure being secured by collateral. It also provides for a broad set of standard or 
bespoke termination rights, which allows the bank to respond swiftly to a counterparty’s default or to other circumstances 
which indicate a high probability of failure.  

The  banks  contractual  termination  rights  are  supported  by  internal  policies  and  procedures  with  defined  roles  and 
responsibilities  which  ensure  that  potential  counterparty  defaults  are  identified  and  addressed  in  a  timely  fashion.  These 
procedures include necessary settlement and trading restrictions. When its decision to terminate derivative transactions results 
in  a  residual  net  obligation  owed  by  the  counterparty,  the  bank  restructures the  obligation  into  a  non-derivative  claim and 
manage it through its regular work-out process. As a consequence, for accounting purposes the bank typically does not show 
any nonperforming derivatives. 

Wrong-way risk occurs when exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty. In 
compliance  with  Article  291(2)  and  (4)  CRR  the  bank  has  a  monthly  process  to  monitor  several  layers  of  wrong-way  risk 
(specific wrong-way risk, general explicit wrong-way risk at country/industry/region levels and general implicit wrong-way risk, 
whereby relevant exposures arising from transactions subject to wrong-way risk are automatically selected and presented for 
comment to the responsible credit officer). A wrong-way risk report is then sent to Credit Risk senior management on a monthly 
basis. In addition, the bank utilized its established process for calibrating its own alpha factor (as defined in Article 284 (9) 
CRR) to estimate the overall wrong-way risk in its derivatives and securities financing transactions portfolio. The Private Bank 
Germany’s derivative counterparty risk is immaterial to the Group and collateral held is typically in the form of cash.

Managing and mitigation of credit risk 

Managing credit risk on counterparty level  

Credit-relevant counterparties are principally allocated to credit officers within credit teams which are organized by type of 
counterparty  (such  as  financial  institutions,  corporates  or  private  individuals),  economic  area  (e.g.,  emerging  markets)  or 
product and supported by dedicated rating analyst teams where deemed necessary. The individual credit officers have the 
relevant expertise and experience to manage the credit risks associated with these counterparties and their associated credit 
related transactions. For retail clients, credit decision making and credit monitoring is highly automated due to standardized 
products and processes. Credit Risk Management has full oversight of the respective processes and tools used in these highly 
automated retail credit processes. It is the responsibility of each credit officer to undertake ongoing credit monitoring for their 
allocated counterparties. Deutsche Bank also has procedures in place intended to identify at an early-stage credit exposures 
for which there may be an increased risk of deteriorated risk/ loss. 

In instances where Deutsche Bank has identified counterparties with emerging concern about their credit quality deteriorating 
or likely to deteriorate to the point where they present a heightened risk of default / loss, the respective counterparty is generally 
placed on the “Watchlist”. Deutsche Bank aims to identify those counterparties at an early stage to ensure that credit exposures 
with increased risks are effectively managed, the Bank’s risk management tools are appropriately applied aiming to minimize 
potential losses. The objective of this early warning system is to address potential problems while adequate options for action 
are still available. This early risk detection is a tenet of Deutsche Bank’s credit culture and is designed to raise management 
awareness of these positions. 

Credit limits for individual counterparties are established by the Credit Risk Management function applying credit authorities 
assigned to individual Credit Officers. This also applies to settlement risk that must fall within limits pre-approved by Credit 
Risk Management and in a manner that reflects expected settlement patterns for the subject counterparty. Credit approvals 
are documented by electronic signature under 4-eye principle by the respective credit authority holders and are retained for 
future reference. 

Credit authority is generally assigned as a personal credit authority according to the individual’s professional qualification and 
experience. All assigned credit authorities are reviewed on a periodic basis to help ensure that they are commensurate with 
the individual performance of the authority holder.  

Where credit authority is insufficient to establish required credit limits, the transaction is referred to a credit authority holder 
with the respective credit authority or if exceeding the highest personal authority to an appropriate credit committee. Where 
personal and committee authorities are insufficient to establish appropriate limits, the case is referred to the Management 
Board for approval. 

Mitigation of credit risk on counterparty level 

In addition to determine counterparty credit quality by assigning internal ratings and the alignment of the exposure with the 
Bank’s  counterparty  concentration  risk  guidelines,  Deutsche  Bank  also  uses  various  credit  risk  mitigation  &  protection 
techniques to optimize credit exposure and reduce potential credit losses. These techniques are applied in the following forms: 

–  Comprehensive and enforceable credit documentation with adequate terms and conditions 
–  Collateral  in  its  various  forms  to  reduce  losses  by  increasing  the  recovery  of  obligations;  key  principles  for  collateral 
management include legal effectiveness and enforceability, prudent and realistic collateral valuations, risk and regulatory 
capital reduction, as well as cost efficiency  

–  Risk transfers, which shift the risk of default of an obligor to a third-party including hedging executed by the bank’s Strategic 

Corporate Lending (SCL) team or entity; other de-risking tools, such as securitizations etc., may also be employed 

–  Netting and collateral arrangements which reduce the credit exposure from derivatives and securities financing transactions 

(e.g. repo transactions) 

–  Hedging of derivatives counterparty risk including CVA, using primarily CDS contracts via the bank’s Counterparty Portfolio

Collateral 

Deutsche Bank regularly agrees on collateral to be received from customers that are subject to credit risk or to be provided 
by third parties agreed by legally effective and enforceable contracts as documented by a written and reasoned legal opinion. 
Collateral  is  credit  protection in  the  form  of  (funded)  assigned  or pledged  assets  or (unfunded) third-party  obligations  that 
serves to mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure, by either substituting the counterparty default risk or improving 
recoveries in the event of a default. Deutsche Bank generally takes all types of eligible collateral for its respective businesses 
but may limit accepted collateral types for specific businesses or regions as customary in the respective market or driven by 
purpose of efficiency. While collateral can be an alternative source of repayment, it does not replace the necessity of high-
quality  underwriting  standards  and  a  thorough  assessment  of  the  debt  service  ability  of  the  counterparty  in  line  with 
Article 194 (9) CRR. 

Deutsche Bank distinguishes the following two types of credit protection approaches:  

–  Funded  Credit  Protection  like  financial  and  other  collateral,  which  enables  Deutsche  Bank  to  recover  all  or  part  of  the 
outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral / asset provided, in cases where the counterparty is unable or unwilling 
to fulfill its primary obligations. Cash collateral, securities (equity, bonds), collateral pledges or assignments of other claims 
or inventory, movable assets (i.e., plant, machinery, ships and aircraft) and real estate typically fall into this category; all 
financial collateral is regularly, mostly daily, revalued and measured against the respective credit exposure; the value of 
other  collateral,  including  real  estate,  is  monitored  based  upon  established  processes  that  includes  regular  reviews  or 
revaluations by internal and/or external experts 

–  Unfunded Credit Protection like Guarantees, which complement the counterparty’s ability to fulfill its obligation under the 
legal contract and as such is provided by uncorrelated third parties. Letters of credit, insurance contracts, export credit 
insurance, guarantees, credit derivatives and (unfunded) risk participations typically fall into this category. Guarantees and 
strong letters of comfort provided by correlated group members of customers (generally the parent company) may also be 
accepted and considered in approved rating approaches; guarantee collateral with a non-investment grade rating of the 
guarantor is limited 

Deutsche Bank’s processes seek to ensure that the collateral accepted for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality. This 
includes  processes  to  generally  ensure  legally  effective  and  enforceable  documentation  for  realizable  and  measurable 
collateral or assets which are evaluated within the on-boarding process by dedicated internal appraisers or teams with the 
respective qualification, skills and experience or adequate external valuers mandated in regulated processes. The applied 
valuations follow generally accepted valuation methods or models. Ongoing correctness of values is monitored by collateral 
type-specific, appropriately frequent, and event-driven reviews considering relevant risk parameters. Revaluations are applied 
in cases of identified probable material deterioration and future monitoring may be adjusted respectively. The assessment of 
the suitability of collateral for a specific transaction is part of the credit decision and must be undertaken in a conservative 
way,  including  collateral  haircuts  that  are  applied.  Deutsche  Bank  has  collateral  type  specific  haircuts  in  place  which  are 
regularly reviewed and approved. In this regard, Deutsche Bank strives to avoid “wrong-way” risk characteristics where the 
counterparty’s risk is positively correlated with the risk of deterioration in the collateral value. For unfunded credit protection 
like guarantees, the process for the analysis of the guarantor’s creditworthiness is aligned to the credit assessment process 
for credit-relevant counterparties. 

The valuation of collateral is considered under a liquidation scenario. The liquidation value is equal to the expected proceeds 
of collateral monetization / realization in a base case scenario, wherein a fair price is achieved through careful preparation 
and orderly liquidation of the collateral. Collateral can either move in value over time (dynamic value) or not (static value). The 
dynamic  liquidation  value  generally  includes  a  safety  margin  or  haircut  over  realizable  value  to  address  liquidity  and 
marketability aspects.

Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality 

The Group assigns a liquidation value to eligible collateral, based on, among other things: 

–  The market value and / or lending value, notional amount or face value of a collateral as a starting point  
–  The type of collateral; the currency mismatch, if any, between the secured exposure and the collateral; and a maturity 

mismatch, if any 

–  The applicable legal environment or jurisdiction (onshore versus offshore collateral) 
–  The market liquidity and volatility in relation to agreed termination clauses 
–  The correlation between the performance of the borrower and the value of the collateral, e.g., in the case of the pledge of 

a borrower’s own shares or securities (in this case generally full correlation leads to no liquidation value) 

–  The quality of physical collateral and potential for litigation or environmental risks; and 
–  A determined collateral type specific haircut (0 – 100%) reflecting collection risks (i.e. price risks over the average liquidation 

period and processing/utilization/sales costs) as specified in the respective policies. 

Collateral haircut settings are typically based on available historic internal and / or external recovery data (expert opinions 
may  also  be  used,  where  appropriate).  They  also  incorporate  a  forward-looking  component  in  the  form  of  collection  and 
valuation forecast provided by experts within Risk Management. Considering the expected proceeds from the liquidation of 
the different collateral types, respective value fluctuations, market specific liquidation costs, and time applied haircuts vary 
between 0 to 100%. When data is not sufficiently available or inconclusive, more conservative haircuts than otherwise used 
must be applied. Haircut settings are reviewed at least annually. 

Risk transfers 
Risk transfers to third parties form a key part of the bank’s overall risk management process and are executed in various 
forms, including outright sales, single name and portfolio hedging, and securitizations. Risk transfers are conducted by the 
respective business units and/ or by Strategic Corporate Lending, in accordance with specifically approved mandates. 

Strategic Corporate Lending manages the residual credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments of the institutional 
and  corporate  credit  portfolio,  part  of  the  leveraged  lending  portfolio  and  the  medium-sized  German  companies’  portfolio 
across the bank’s Corporate Bank and Investment Bank divisions.  

Acting as a central pricing reference, Strategic Corporate Lending provides the businesses with an observed or derived capital 
market rate for loan applications; however, the decision of whether or not the business can enter into the credit risk remains 
exclusively with Credit Risk Management. 

Strategic  Corporate  Lending  concentrates  on  two  primary  objectives  within  the  credit  risk  framework  to  enhance  risk 
management discipline, improve returns and use capital more efficiently:  

–  To reduce single-name credit risk concentrations within the credit portfolio and 
–  To manage credit exposures by utilizing techniques including loan sales, securitization via collateralized loan obligations, 

sub-participations and single-name and portfolio credit default swaps 

Netting and collateral arrangements for derivatives and securities financing transactions 
Netting is applicable to both exchange traded derivatives and OTC derivatives. Netting is also applied to securities financing 
transactions  (e.g.  repurchase,  securities  lending  and  margin  lending  transactions)  as  far  as  documentation,  structure  and 
nature  of  the  risk  mitigation  allow  netting  with  the  underlying  credit  risk  in  accordance  with  applicable  law  and  the  bank’s 
Financial Contracts Netting and Collateral Policy and Procedures – Legal (collectively, “Netting Policies”). While cross-product 
netting between derivatives and securities financing transactions may be used in certain cases, the bank does not make use 
of cross-product netting for regulatory purposes. 

All exchange traded derivatives are cleared through central counterparties (CCPs), which interpose themselves between the 
trading entities by becoming the counterparty to each of the entities. Where legally required or where available and to the 
extent agreed with the bank’s counterparties, Deutsche Bank also uses CCP clearing for its OTC derivative transactions.

The Dodd-Frank Act and related Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rules require CCP clearing in the United 
States  for  certain  standardized  OTC  derivative  transactions,  including  certain  interest  rate  swaps  and  index  credit  default 
swaps, subject to limited exceptions when facing certain counterparties. The European Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on OTC 
Derivatives,  Central  Counterparties  and  Trade  Repositories  (EMIR)  and  the  Commission  Delegated  Regulations  (EU) 
2015/2205, (EU) 2015/592 and (EU) 2016/1178 based thereupon introduced mandatory CCP clearing in the EU for certain 
standardized OTC derivatives transactions. Mandatory CCP clearing in the EU began for certain interest rate derivatives on 
June 21, 2016 and for certain iTraxx-based credit derivatives and additional interest rate derivatives on February 9, 2017. 
Article  4  (2)  of  EMIR  authorizes  competent  authorities  to  exempt  intragroup  transactions  from  mandatory  CCP  clearing, 
provided certain requirements, such as full consolidation of the intragroup transactions and the application of an appropriate 
centralized  risk  evaluation,  measurement  and  control  procedure  are  met.  The  bank  successfully  applied  for  the  clearing 
exemption for a number of its regulatory-consolidated subsidiaries with intragroup derivatives, including e.g., Deutsche Bank 
Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. As of December 31, 2023, the bank is allowed to make use of intragroup 
exemptions from the EMIR clearing obligation for 58 bilateral intragroup relationships. The extent of the exemptions differs as 
not all entities enter into relevant transaction types subject to the clearing obligation. Of the 58 intragroup relationships, 14 are 
relationships where both entities are established in the Union (EU) for which a full exemption has been granted, and 44 are 
relationships where one is established in a third country (“Third Country Relationship”). Third Country Relationships required 
repeat applications for each new asset class being subject to the clearing obligation; the process took place in the course of 
2017. Due to “Brexit”, the status of some group entities has changed from an EU entity to a third country entity, but there has 
been no impact for the bank in respect clearing exemptions. 

The rules and regulations of CCPs typically provide for the bilateral set off of all amounts payable on the same day and in the 
same currency (“payment netting”) thereby reducing the bank’s settlement risk. Depending on the business model applied by 
the CCP, this payment netting applies either to all of the bank’s derivatives cleared by the CCP or at least to those that form 
part of the same class of derivatives. Many CCPs’ rules and regulations also provide for the termination, close-out and netting 
of  all  cleared  transactions  upon  the  CCP’s  default  (“close-out  netting”),  which  reduces  the  bank’s  credit  risk.  In  its  risk 
measurement  and  risk  assessment  processes  Deutsche Bank  applies  close-out netting  only  to  the  extent Deutsche Bank 
believes that the relevant CCP’s close-out netting provisions are legally valid and enforceable and have been approved in 
accordance with the bank’s Netting Policies. 

In order to reduce the credit risk resulting from OTC derivative transactions, where CCP clearing is not available, Deutsche 
Bank regularly seeks the execution of standard master agreements (such as master agreements for derivatives published by 
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) or the German Master Agreement for Financial Derivative 
Transactions) with the bank’s counterparties. A master agreement allows for the close-out netting of rights and obligations 
arising under derivative transactions that have been entered into under such a master agreement upon the counterparty’s 
default, resulting in a single net claim owed by or to the counterparty. Payment netting may be agreed from time to time with 
the  bank’s  counterparties  for  multiple  transactions  having  the  same  payment  dates  (e.g.,  foreign  exchange  transactions) 
pursuant to the terms of master agreements which can, reduce the bank’s settlement risk. In its risk measurement and risk 
assessment processes Deutsche Bank applies close-out netting only to the extent Deutsche Bank has concluded that the 
master agreement is legally valid and enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions and the recognition of close-out netting has been 
approved in accordance with the bank’s Netting Policies. 

Deutsche Bank also enters into credit support annexes (CSAs) to master agreements in order to further reduce the bank’s 
derivatives-related credit risk. These annexes generally provide risk mitigation through periodic, usually daily, margining of the 
covered exposure. The CSAs also provide for the right to terminate the related derivative transactions upon the counterparty’s 
failure to honor a margin call. As with netting, when Deutsche Bank believes the annex is enforceable, Deutsche Bank reflects 
this in its exposure measurement. 

Certain CSAs to master agreements provide for rating-dependent triggers, where additional collateral must be pledged if a 
party’s rating is downgraded. Deutsche Bank also enters into master agreements that provide for an additional termination 
event upon a party’s rating downgrade. These downgrade provisions in CSAs and master agreements usually apply to both 
parties  but  in  some  agreements  may  apply  to  Deutsche  Bank  only.  Deutsche  Bank  analyzes  and  monitors  its  potential 
contingent payment obligations resulting from a rating downgrade in its stress testing and liquidity coverage ratio approach 
for liquidity risk on an ongoing basis. For an assessment of the quantitative impact of a downgrading of the bank’s credit rating 
please refer to table “Stress Testing Results” in the section “Liquidity Risk”.

The Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules thereunder, including CFTC rule § 23.504, as well as EMIR and Commission Delegated 
Regulation  based  thereon,  namely  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2016/2251,  introduced  the  mandatory  use  of 
master agreements and related CSAs, which must be executed prior to or contemporaneously with entering into an uncleared 
OTC  derivative  transaction.  Certain  documentation  is  also  required  by  the  U.S.  margin  rules  adopted  by  U.S.  prudential 
regulators. Under the U.S. prudential regulators’ margin rules, Deutsche Bank is required to post and collect initial margin for 
its derivatives exposures with other derivatives dealers, as well as with the bank’s counterparties that (a) are “financial end 
users,” as that term is defined in the U.S. margin rules, and (b) have an average daily aggregate notional amount of uncleared 
swaps, uncleared security-based swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps exceeding U.S.$ 8 billion in 
June, July and August of the previous calendar year. The U.S. margin rules additionally requires Deutsche Bank to post and 
collect variation margin for its derivatives with other derivatives dealers and certain financial end user counterparties. These 
margin requirements are subject to a U.S.$ 50 million threshold for initial margin, but no threshold for variation margin, with a 
combined U.S.$ 500,000 minimum transfer amount. The U.S. margin requirements have been in effect for large banks since 
September 2016, with additional variation margin requirements having come into effect March 1, 2017 and additional initial 
margin requirements having been phased in from September 2017 through September 2022. 

Under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251, which implements the EMIR margin requirements, the CSA must 
provide for daily valuation and daily variation margining based on a zero threshold and a minimum transfer amount of not 
more than € 500,000. For large derivative exposures exceeding € 8 billion, initial margin has to be posted as well. The variation 
margin requirements under EMIR apply as of March 1, 2017; the initial margin requirements originally were subject to a staged 
phase-in  until  September 1,  2021. However,  legislative  changes  published  on  February 17,  2021  extended  deadlines into 
2022. Under Article 31 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251, an EU party may decide to not exchange margin 
with counterparties in certain non-netting jurisdictions provided certain requirements are met. Pursuant to Article 11 (5) to (10) 
of  EMIR,  competent  authorities  are  authorized  to  exempt  intragroup  transactions  from  the  margining  obligation,  provided 
certain requirements are met. While some of those requirements are the same as for the EMIR clearing exemptions (see 
above), there are additional requirements such as the absence of any current or foreseen practical or legal impediment to the 
prompt  transfer  of  funds  or  repayment  of  liabilities  between  intragroup  counterparties.  The  bank  is  making  use  of  this 
exemption. The bank has successfully applied for the collateral exemption for some of its regulatory-consolidated subsidiaries 
with  intragroup  derivatives,  including,  e.g.,  Deutsche  Bank  Securities  Inc.  and  Deutsche  Bank  Luxembourg  S.A.  As  of 
December 31, 2023, the bank is allowed to use intragroup exemptions from the EMIR collateral obligation for a number of 
bilateral  intragroup  relationships  which  are  published  under  db.com/legal-resources/european-market-infrastructure-
regulation/intra-group-exemptions-margining. For some bilateral intragroup relationships, the EMIR margining exemption may 
be used based on Article 11 (5) of EMIR, i.e. without the need for any application or publication, because both entities are 
established in the same EU Member State. For third country subsidiaries, the intragroup exemption was originally limited until 
the earlier of June 30, 2022 and four months after the publication of an equivalence decision by the EU Commission under 
Article 13(2) EMIR, unless, in the case of an equivalence decision being applicable, a follow-up exemption application is made 
and granted. On February 13, 2023, an amendment to Regulation (EU) 2016/2251 has been published in the Official Journal, 
which amendment relates to the extension of the exemption end date until June 30, 2025. While the application requirement 
may be abolished with “EMIR 3.0” (see European Commission proposal COM (2022) 697 final), Deutsche Bank continues to 
have processes in place ensuring readiness for intragroup margining should the need arise. 

Concentrations within credit risk mitigation 
Concentrations within credit risk mitigations taken may occur if a number of guarantors and credit derivative providers with 
similar  economic  characteristics  are  engaged  in  comparable  activities  with  changes  in  economic  or  industry  conditions 
affecting their ability to meet contractual obligations. Concentration risk may also occur in collateral portfolios (e.g. multiple 
claims and receivables against third parties) which are considered conservatively within the valuation process and / or on-site 
inspections where applicable. Deutsche Bank uses a range of tools and metrics to monitor its credit risk mitigating activities 
and potential concentrations. 

For more qualitative and quantitative details in relation to the application of credit risk mitigation and potential concentration 
effects please refer to the section “Maximum exposure to credit risk”.

Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality 

Managing credit risk on portfolio level 

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Portfolio sets the framework for the management of  concentration risks at a portfolio 
level. This includes strategically setting, monitoring, reviewing, reporting, and controlling credit risk appetites across various 
dimensions such as group, division, business unit, legal entity, branch, country, and industry level that need to be considered 
in the context of credit approvals. In addition, ERM Portfolio provides a comprehensive and holistic view of the bank’s risk 
profile across risk types. 

On  a  portfolio  level,  significant  concentrations  of  credit  risk  could  result  from  having  material  exposures  to  a  number  of 
counterparties with similar economic characteristics, or who are engaged in comparable activities, where these similarities 
may cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be affected in the same manner by changes in economic or industry 
conditions. 

Deutsche Bank’s portfolio management framework supports a comprehensive assessment of concentrations within its credit 
risk portfolio in order to keep concentrations within acceptable levels. 

Risk and portfolio developments are regularly discussed at the Credit Risk Appetite and Portfolio Management Forum which 
includes representation from across the Credit Risk Management function including the Head of Credit Risk Management. 

Industry risk management 
To  manage  industry  risk,  Deutsche  Bank  has  grouped  its  corporate  and  financial  institutions  counterparties  into  various 
industry sub-portfolios. Portfolios are regularly reviewed at least on an annual basis. Reviews highlight industry developments 
and risks to the bank’s credit portfolio, review cross-risk concentration risks, analyze the risk/reward profile of the portfolio and 
incorporate the results of an economic downside stress test. Finally, this analysis is used to define the credit strategies for the 
portfolio in question. 

In the bank’s industry risk management framework, thresholds are established for aggregate credit limits to counterparties 
within each industry sub-portfolio. For risk management purposes, the aggregation of limits across industry sectors follows an 
internal  risk  view  that  does  not  have  to  be  congruent  with  NACE  (Nomenclature  des  Activities  Economiques  dans  la 
Communate Europeenne) code-based view applied elsewhere in this report. Regular industry portfolio overviews are prepared 
for the Enterprise Risk Committee to discuss recent developments and to agree on risk management actions where necessary. 

Beyond credit risk, the bank’s industry risk framework comprises of thresholds for Traded Credit Positions while key industry 
relevant non-financial risks are closely monitored. 

Country risk management 
Avoiding  undue  concentrations  from  a  regional  and  country  perspective  is  also  an  integral  part  of  the  bank’s  credit  risk 
management framework. In order to achieve this, country risk thresholds are applied to countries in Non-Japan Asia, Central 
Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa and Latin America as well as selected Developed Markets countries (based on internal 
country risk ratings). Country portfolios are regularly reviewed with the frequency of review dependent on portfolio size and 
risk profile as well as risk developments. Larger / riskier portfolios are reviewed at least on an annual basis. These reviews 
assess amongst other factors, key macroeconomic and political risk developments and outlook; portfolio composition, quality 
and cross-risk concentrations under normal and stress conditions; analyze the risk / reward profile of the portfolio. Based on 
this and taking into account the Group’s Risk Appetite and strategy, country risk appetite and strategies are set by ERM.  

In  the  bank’s  country  risk  framework,  thresholds  are  established  for  counterparty  credit  risk  exposures  in  each  country  to 
manage the aggregate credit risk subject to country-specific economic and political events. These thresholds cover exposures 
to  entities  incorporated  locally  and  subsidiaries  of  foreign  multinational  corporations  as  well  as  companies  with  significant 
economic or operational dependence on a specific country even though they are incorporated externally. In addition, gap risk 
thresholds  are set  to  control  the  risk  of  loss  due  to  intra-country wrong-way  risk  exposure.  As  such, for  risk  management 
purposes, the aggregation of exposures across countries follows an internal risk view that may differ from the geographical 
exposure view applied elsewhere in this report. Beyond credit risk, the bank’s country risk framework comprises thresholds 
for trading positions that measure the aggregate market value of traded credit risk positions. For Emerging Markets, thresholds 
are also set to measure the profit and loss impact under specific country stress scenarios on trading positions across the 
bank’s portfolio. Furthermore, thresholds are set for capital and intra-group funding exposure of Deutsche Bank entities in 
above countries given the transfer risk inherent in these cross-border positions. Key non-financial risks are closely monitored 
and factored into financial threshold setting considerations where relevant. Deutsche Bank’s country risk ratings represent a 
key tool in its management of country risk. They include:

–  Sovereign rating (set and managed by ERM Risk Research): A measure of the probability of the sovereign defaulting on 

its foreign or local currency obligations 

–  Transfer risk rating (set and managed by ERM Risk research): A measure of the probability of a “transfer risk event”, i.e., 
the risk that an otherwise solvent debtor is unable to meet its obligations due to inability to obtain foreign currency or to 
transfer assets as a result of direct sovereign intervention 

All sovereign and transfer risk ratings are reviewed, at least on an annual basis.  

Product/Asset class specific risk management 
Complementary to the bank’s counterparty, industry and country risk approach, Deutsche Bank focuses on certain product / 
asset class specific risk concentrations and sets limits or thresholds where required for risk management purposes. Specific 
risk limits are set in particular if a concentration of transactions of a specific type might lead to significant losses under certain 
conditions. In this respect, correlated losses might result from disruptions in the functioning of financial markets, significant 
moves in market parameters to which the respective product or asset class is sensitive to, or other risk drivers common to the 
asset class.  

Private  Bank  and  certain  Corporate  Bank  businesses  are  managed  via  product-specific  strategies  setting  the  bank’s  risk 
appetite for portfolios with similar credit risk characteristics, such as the retail portfolios of mortgages and consumer finance 
products as well as products for business clients. Risk analyses are performed on portfolio level including further breakdown 
into business units as well as countries/regions. In Wealth Management, target levels are set for global concentrations along 
products as well as based on type and liquidity of collateral.  

Underwriting of capital markets transactions 

Specific  focus  is  placed  on  transactions  with  underwriting  risks  where  Deutsche  Bank  underwrites  commitments  with  the 
intention to sell down or distribute part of the risk to third parties. These commitments include the undertaking to provide bank 
loans  for  syndication  into  the  debt  capital  market  and  bridge  loans  for  the  issuance  of  notes.  The  inherent  risks  of  being 
unsuccessful in the distribution of the facilities or the placement of the notes, comprise of a delayed distribution, funding of the 
underlying loans as well as a pricing risk as some underwriting commitments are additionally exposed to market risk in the 
form of widening credit spreads. Where applicable, Deutsche Bank dynamically hedges this credit spread risk to be within the 
approved market risk limit framework. 

A  major  asset  class,  in  which  Deutsche  Bank  is  active  in  underwriting,  is  leverage  lending,  which  Deutsche  Bank  mainly 
executes through its Leveraged Debt Capital Markets business unit. The business model is a fee-based‚ originate to distribute 
approach  focused  on  the  distribution  of  largely  unfunded  underwriting  commitments  into  the  capital  market.  The  afore-
mentioned risks regarding distribution and credit spread movement apply to this business unit, however, are managed under 
a range of specific notional as well as market risk limits. The latter require the business to also hedge its underwriting pipeline 
against market dislocations. The fee-based model of the bank’s Leveraged Debt Capital Markets business unit includes a 
restrictive  approach  to  single-name  risk  concentrations  retained  on  Deutsche  Bank’s  balance  sheet,  which  results  in  a 
diversified overall portfolio without any material concentrations. The resulting longer-term on-balance sheet portfolio is also 
subject to a comprehensive credit limit and hedging framework. 

Deutsche Bank assumes underwriting risk with respect to Commercial Real Estate loans. Primarily in the Commercial Real 
Estate business unit in the Investment Bank loans may be originated with the intent to securitize in the capital markets or 
syndicate to other lenders. The afore-mentioned inherent underwriting risks such as delayed distribution and pricing risk are 
managed through notional caps, market risk limits and hedging against the risk of market dislocations. 

Deutsche  Bank  also  provides  material  underwriting  activity  through  its  Debt  Capital  Markets  desk  which  is  focused  on 
supporting Investment Grade and cross-over rated corporate borrowers, usually in connection with M&A transaction financing. 
These exposures are typically 12-24 month bridge loans, which are expected to be repaid by syndicated loans and/or capital 
markets issuance by the borrower. Deutsche Bank does not bear market placement or pricing risk on these exposures but 
faces funding risk and credit risk for the duration of the commitment, which are managed through notional underwriting limits 
for the Group and an industry concentration framework.

Market Risk Management 

Market Risk Management 

Market Risk framework 

The vast majority of Deutsche Bank’s businesses are subject to market risk, defined as the potential for change in the market 
value of the Group’s trading  and invested positions. Risk can arise from changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign 
exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and other relevant parameters, such as market volatility and market implied 
default probabilities. The market risk can affect accounting, economic and regulatory views of the exposure. 

Market Risk Management is part of Deutsche Bank’s independent Risk function and sits within the Market and Valuations Risk 
Management  group.  One  of  the  primary  objectives  of  Market  Risk  Management  is  to  ensure  that  the  business  units’  risk 
exposure is within the approved risk appetite commensurate with its defined strategy. To achieve this objective, Market Risk 
Management works closely together with risk takers (“the business units”) and other control and support groups. 

The Group distinguishes between three substantially different types of market risk: 

–  Trading market risk arises primarily through the market-making and client facilitation activities of the Investment Bank and 
Corporate Bank divisions. This involves taking positions in debt, equity, foreign exchange, other securities and commodities 
as well as in equivalent derivatives 

–  Traded default risk arising from defaults and rating migrations relating to trading instruments 
–  Non-trading market risk arises from market movements, primarily outside the activities of the trading units, in the banking 
book  and  from  off-balance  sheet  items;  this  includes  interest  rate  risk,  credit  spread  risk,  investment  risk  and  foreign 
exchange  risk  as  well  as  market  risk  arising  from  pension  schemes,  guaranteed  funds  and  equity  compensation;  non-
trading market risk also includes risk from the modeling of client deposits as well as savings and loan products 

Market Risk Management governance is designed and established to promote oversight of all market risks, effective decision-
making and timely escalation to senior management. 

Market  Risk  Management  defines  and  implements  a  framework  to  systematically  identify,  assess,  monitor  and  report  the 
Group’s market risk. Market risk managers identify market risks through active portfolio analysis and engagement with the 
business units. 

Market Risk measurement  

The Group aims to accurately measure all types of market risks by a comprehensive set of risk metrics embedding accounting, 
economic and regulatory considerations. 

The market risks are measured by several internally developed key risk metrics and regulatory defined market risk approaches.  

Trading Market Risk  

The Group’s primary mechanism to manage trading market risk is the application of the bank’s risk appetite framework of 
which the limit framework is a key component. The Management Board, supported by Market Risk Management, sets group-
wide  value-at-risk,  economic  capital  and  portfolio  stress  testing  limits  for  market  risk  in  the  trading  book.  Market  Risk 
Management allocates this overall appetite to the Corporate Divisions and their individual business units based on established 
and agreed business plans. Deutsche Bank also has business aligned heads within Market Risk Management who establish 
business unit limits, by allocating the limit down to individual portfolios, geographical regions and types of market risks.  

Value-at-risk, economic capital and portfolio stress testing limits are used for managing all types of market risk at an overall 
portfolio level. As an additional and important complementary tool for managing certain portfolios or risk types, Market Risk 
Management  performs  risk  analysis  and  business  specific  stress  testing.  Limits  are  also  set  on  sensitivity  and 
concentration/liquidity, exposure, business-level stress testing and event risk scenarios, taking into consideration business 
plans and the risk vs return assessment. 

Business units are responsible for adhering to the limits against which exposures are monitored and reported. The market risk 
limits set by Market Risk Management are monitored on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, dependent on the risk management 
tool being used.

Internally developed Market Risk Models 

Value-at-Risk (VaR) 

VaR is a quantitative measure of the potential loss (in value) of Fair Value positions due to market movements that should not 
be exceeded in a defined period of time and with a defined confidence level.  

The  Group’s  value-at-risk  for  the  trading  businesses  is  based  on  historical  simulation  model  (internal  model  approach) 
predominantly utilizing full revaluation, although some portfolios remain on a sensitivity based approach. The approach is used 
for both Risk Management and capital requirements.  

Risk management VaR is calibrated to a 99% confidence level and a one day holding period. This means we estimate there 
is a 1 in 100 chance that a mark-to-market loss from our trading positions will be at least as large as the reported VaR. For 
regulatory capital purposes, the VaR model is calibrated to a 99% confidence interval and a ten day holding period. 

The calculation employs a historical simulation technique that uses one year of historical market data as input and observed 
correlations between the risk factors during this one year period. 

The VaR model is designed to take into account a comprehensive set of risk factors across all asset classes. Key risk factors 
are swap/government curves, index and issuer-specific credit curves, single equity and index prices, foreign exchange rates, 
commodity prices as well as their implied volatilities. To help ensure completeness in the risk coverage, second order risk 
factors,  e.g.  money  market  basis,  implied  dividends,  option-adjusted  spreads  and  precious  metals  lease  rates  are  also 
considered in the VaR calculation. The list of risk factors included in the VaR model is reviewed regularly and enhanced as 
part of ongoing model performance reviews. 

The model incorporates both linear and, especially for derivatives, nonlinear impacts predominantly through a full revaluation 
approach but it also utilizes a sensitivity-based approach for certain portfolios. The full revaluation approach uses the historical 
changes to risk factors as input to pricing functions. Whilst this approach is computationally expensive, it does yield a more 
accurate view of market risk for nonlinear positions, especially under stressed scenarios. The sensitivity based approach uses 
sensitivities to underlying risk factors in combination with historical changes to those risk factors.  

For each business unit a separate VaR is calculated for each risk type, e.g. interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, 
foreign exchange risk and commodity risk. “Diversification effect” reflects the fact that the total VaR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VaR relating to the individual risk types. Simply adding the VaR figures of the individual risk types 
to arrive at an aggregate VaR would imply the assumption that the losses in all risk types occur simultaneously. 

The VaR enables the Group to apply a consistent measure across the fair value exposures. It allows a comparison of risk in 
different businesses, and also provides a means of aggregating and netting positions within a portfolio to reflect correlations 
and  offsets  between  different  asset  classes.  Furthermore,  it  facilitates  comparisons  of  the  market  risk  both  over  time  and 
against the daily trading results. 

When using VaR results a number of considerations should be taken into account. These include: 

–  The use of historical market data may not be a good indicator of potential future events, particularly those that are extreme 
in nature; this “backward-looking” limitation can cause VaR to understate future potential losses (as in financial credit crisis 
2008/09),  but  can  also  cause  it  to  be  overstated  immediately  following  a  period  of  significant  stress  (as  in  COVID-19 
pandemic)  

–  The one day holding period does not fully capture the market risk arising during periods of illiquidity, when positions cannot 

be closed out or hedged within one day 

–  VaR does not indicate the potential loss beyond the 99th quantile 
–  Intra-day risk is not reflected in the end of day VaR calculation 
–  There may be risks in the trading or banking book that are not fully captured in the VaR model (either partially captured or 

missing entirely) 

The process of systematically capturing and evaluating risks currently not captured in the bank’s VaR model has been further 
developed and improved. An assessment is made to determine the level of materiality of these risks and material risks are 
prioritized for inclusion in the bank’s internal model. Risks not in VaR are monitored and assessed on a regular basis through 
the Risk Not In VaR (RNIV) framework. This framework has also undergone a significant overhaul in 2020 which included the 
alignment  of  methodologies  with  the  Historical  Simulation  approach  which  in  turn  yields  a  more  accurate  estimate  of  the 
contribution of these missing items and their potential capitalization. 

Deutsche Bank is committed to the ongoing development of the internal risk models, and substantial resources are allocated 
to review, validate and improve them.

Stressed Value-at-Risk 

Stressed Value-at-Risk (SVaR) calculates a stressed value-at-risk measure based on a one year period of significant market 
stress. The Group calculates a stressed value-at-risk measure using a 99% confidence level. Stressed VaR is calculated with 
a holding period of ten days. The SVaR calculation utilizes the same systems, trade information and processes as those used 
for the calculation of value-at-risk. The only difference is that historical market data and observed correlations from a period 
of significant financial stress (i.e., characterized by high volatilities) are used as an input for the historical simulation.  

The stress period selection process for the stressed value-at-risk calculation is based on the comparison of VaR calculated 
using historical time windows compared to the current SVaR. If a historical window produces a VaR which is higher than the 
current SVaR, it is further investigated and the SVaR window can subsequently be updated accordingly. This process runs on 
a quarterly basis. 

During  2023,  the  stress  period  selection  process  for  the  Group  was  conducted  as  outlined  above.  As  a  result,  the  SVaR 
window used at various periods in 2023 included the Financial credit crisis of 2008/09 and the European sovereign crisis of 
2011/12. 

Incremental Risk Charge  

Incremental Risk Charge captures default and credit rating migration risks for credit-sensitive positions in the trading book. 
The Group uses a Monte Carlo Simulation for calculating incremental risk charge as the 99.9% quantile of the portfolio loss 
distribution over a one-year capital horizon under a constant position approach and for allocating contributory incremental risk 
charge to individual positions.  

The  model  captures  the  default  and  migration  risk  in  an  accurate  and  consistent  quantitative  approach  for  all  portfolios. 
Important  parameters  for  the  incremental  risk  charge  calculation  are  exposures,  recovery  rates,  maturities,  ratings  with 
corresponding default and migration probabilities and parameters specifying issuer correlations.  

Market Risk Standardized Approach  

The Market Risk Standardized Approach (“MRSA”) is used to determine the regulatory capital charge for the specific market 
risk  of  trading  book  securitizations,  for  certain  types  of  investment  funds  and  for  longevity  risk  as  set  out  in  CRR/CRD 
regulations. 

Longevity risk is the risk of adverse changes in life expectancies resulting in a loss in value on longevity linked policies and 
transactions. For risk management purposes, stress testing and economic capital allocations are also used to monitor and 
manage longevity risk. 

Market Risk Stress Testing 

Stress  testing  is  a  key  risk  management  technique,  which  evaluates  the  potential  effects  of  extreme  market  events  and 
movements in individual risk factors. It is one of the core quantitative tools used to assess the market risk of Deutsche Bank’s 
positions and complements VaR and Economic Capital. Market Risk Management performs several types of stress testing to 
capture  the  variety  of  risks  (Portfolio  Stress  Testing,  individual  specific  stress  tests  and  Event  Risk  Scenarios)  and  also 
contributes to Group-wide stress testing. These stress tests cover a wide range of severities designed to test the earnings 
stability and capital adequacy of the bank. 

Trading Market Risk Economic Capital 

Deutsche Bank’s trading market risk economic capital model-scaled Stressed VaR based EC (SVaR based EC) - comprises 
two core components, the “common risk” component covering risk drivers across all businesses and the “business-specific 
risk”  component,  which  enriches  the  Common  Risk  via  a  suite  of  Business  Specific  Stress  Tests.  Both  components  are 
calibrated  to  historically  observed  severe  market  shocks.  Common  risk  is  calculated  using  a  scaled  version  of  the  SVaR 
framework while Business Specific Stress Tests are designed to capture more product/business-related bespoke risks (e.g. 
complex basis risks) as well as higher order risks not captured in the common risk component. The SVaR based EC uses the 
Monte Carlo SVaR framework.

Traded Default Risk Economic Capital  

The Traded Default Risk Economic Capital captures the relevant credit exposures across our trading and fair value banking 
books.  Trading  book  exposures  are  monitored  by  Market  Risk  Management  via  single  name  concentration  and  portfolio 
thresholds which are set based upon rating, size and liquidity. Single name concentration risk thresholds are set for two key 
metrics: Default Exposure, i.e., the P&L impact of an instantaneous default at the current recovery rate, and bond equivalent 
Market Value, i.e. default exposure at 0% recovery. In order to capture diversification and concentration effects we perform a 
joint  calculation  for  traded  default  risk  economic  capital  and  credit  risk  economic  capital.  Important  parameters  for  the 
calculation of traded default risk are exposures, recovery rates and default probabilities as well as maturities. The probability 
of  joint  rating  downgrades  and  defaults  is  determined  by  the  default  and  rating  correlations  of  the  portfolio  model.  These 
correlations are specified through systematic factors that represent countries, geographical regions and industries. 

Trading Market Risk Reporting 

Market Risk Management reporting creates transparency on the risk profile and facilitates the understanding of core market 
risk  drivers  to  all  levels  of  the  organization.  The  Management  Board  and  Senior  Governance  Committees  receive  regular 
reporting, as well as ad hoc reporting as required, on market risk, regulatory capital and stress testing. Senior Risk Committees 
receive risk information at a number of frequencies, including weekly or monthly. 

Additionally, Market Risk Management produces daily and weekly Market Risk specific reports and daily limit utilization reports 
for each business owner. 

Regulatory prudent valuation of assets carried at fair value 

Pursuant  to  Article  34  CRR,  institutions  shall  apply  the  prudent  valuation  requirements  of  Article  105  CRR  to  all  assets 
measured at fair value and shall deduct from CET 1 capital the amount of any additional value adjustments necessary. 

We  determined  the  amount  of  the  additional  value  adjustments  based  on  the  methodology  defined  in  the  Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101.  

As of December 31, 2023 the amount of the additional value adjustments was € 1.7 billion. The December 31, 2022 amount 
was € 2.0 billion. The decrease was predominantly due to a combination of risk exposure changes and reductions in price 
dispersion.  

As  of  December  31,  2023  the  reduction  of  the  expected  loss  from  subtracting  the  additional  value  adjustments  was 
€ 102 million, which partly mitigated the negative impact of the additional value adjustments on our CET 1 capital. 

Non-trading Market Risk 

Non-trading market risk arises primarily from activities outside of the trading units, in the banking book, including pension 
schemes and guarantees, and embedding considerations of different accounting treatments of transactions. Significant market 
risk factors the Group is exposed to and are overseen by risk management groups in that area are interest rate risk (including 
risk  from  embedded  optionality  and  changes  in  behavioral  patterns  for  certain  product  types),  credit  spread  risk,  foreign 
exchange  risk  (including  structural  foreign  exchange  risk),  equity  risk  (including  equity  compensation  related  risk  and 
investments in public and private equity as well as real estate, infrastructure and fund assets). 

As for trading market risks the Group’s risk appetite and limit framework is also applied to manage our exposure to non-trading 
market risk. On group level those are captured by the management board set limits for market risk economic capital capturing 
exposures to all market risks across asset classes as well as earnings and economic value based limits for interest rate risk 
in the banking books. Those limits are cascaded down by market risk management to the divisional or portfolio level. The limit 
framework for non-trading market risk exposure is further complemented by a set of business specific stress tests, value-at-
risk & sensitivity limits monitored on a daily or monthly basis dependent on the risk measure being used. 

Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book 

Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the current or prospective risk, to both the Group's capital and earnings, 
arising from movements in interest rates, which affect the Group's banking book exposures. This includes gap risk, which 
arises  from  the  term  structure  of  banking  book  instruments,  basis  risk,  which  describes  the  impact  of  relative  changes  in 
interest rates for financial instruments that are priced using different interest rate curves, as well as option risk, which arises 
from option derivative positions or from optional elements embedded in financial instruments.

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Risk and Capital Management 
Market Risk Management 

The Group manages its IRRBB exposures using economic value as well as earnings based measures. The Group Treasury 
function is mandated to manage the interest rate risk centrally, with Market Risk Management acting as 2nd Line of Defense 
(LoD)  independently  assessing  and  challenging  the  implementation  of  the  framework  and  adherence  to  the  risk  appetite. 
Group Audit in its role as the 3rd LoD is accountable for providing independent and objective assurance on the adequacy of 
the design, operating effectiveness and efficiency of the risk management system and systems of internal control. The Group 
Asset & Liability Committee (“ALCo”) oversees and steers the Group’s structural interest risk position with particular focus on 
banking book risks and the management of the net interest income. The ALCo monitors the sensitivity of financial resources 
and associated metrics to key market parameters such as interest rate curves and oversees adherence to divisional/business 
financial resource limits. 

Economic value based measures look at the change in economic value of banking book assets, liabilities and off-balance 
sheet  exposures  resulting  from  interest  rate  movements,  independent  of  the  accounting  treatment.  Thereby  the  Group 
measures the change in economic value of equity (∆EVE) as the maximum decrease of the banking book economic value 
under the six standard scenarios defined by the EBA in addition to internal stress scenarios for risk steering purposes. For the 
reporting of internal stress scenarios and risk appetite the Group applies a few different modelling assumptions as used in this 
disclosure.  When  aggregating  the  economic  value  of  equity  ∆EVE  across  different  currencies,  DB  adds  up  negative  and 
positive  changes  without  applying  weight  factors  for  positive  changes.  Furthermore,  the  Group  is  using  behavioral  model 
assumptions about the interest rate duration of own equity capital as well as non-maturity deposits from financial institutions. 

Earnings-based measures look at the expected change in net interest income (NII) resulting from interest rate movements 
over a defined time horizon, compared to a defined benchmark scenario. Thereby the Group measures net interest income 
∆NII as the maximum reduction under the six standard scenarios defined by the EBA in addition to internal stress scenarios 
for risk steering purposes, compared to a market implied curve scenario, over a period of 12 months. 

The Group employs mitigation techniques to hedge the interest rate risk arising from non-trading positions within given limits. 
The interest rate risk arising from non-trading asset and liability positions is managed through Treasury Markets & Investments. 
Thereby the Group uses derivatives and applies different hedge accounting techniques such as fair value hedge accounting 
or cash flow hedge accounting. For fair value hedges, the Group uses interest rate swaps and options contracts to manage 
the fair value movements of fixed rate financial instruments due to changes in benchmark interest. For hedges in the context 
of the cash flow hedge accounting, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to cash flow variability of the 
variable rate instruments as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates.  

The Group assesses and measures hedge effectiveness of a hedging relationship based on the change in the fair value or 
cash  flows  of  the  derivative  hedging  instrument  relative  to  the  change  in  the  fair  value  or  cash  flows  of  the  hedged  item 
attributable to the hedged risk. 

The “Model Risk Management” function performs independent validation of models used for IRRBB measurement, as per all 
market risk models, in line with Deutsche Bank’s group-wide risk governance framework.  

The calculation of VaR and sensitivities of interest rate risk is performed daily, whereas the measurement and reporting of 
economic value interest rate and earnings risk is performed on a monthly basis. The Group generally uses the same metrics 
in its internal management systems as it applies for the disclosure in this report.  

Deutsche Bank’s key modelling assumptions are applied to the positions in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank divisions. 
Those positions are subject to risk of changes in client’s behavior with regard to their deposits as well as loan products. The 
Group  regularly  tests  the  assumptions  and  updates  them  where  appropriate  following  a  defined  governance  process.  In 
particular, the  Group has made changes to its assumptions during the early phase of rising interest rates  where a slower 
repricing in deposits was observed than it was anticipated. 

The Group manages the interest rate risk exposure of its non-maturity deposits through a replicating portfolio approach to 
determine the average repricing maturity of the portfolio. For the purpose of constructing the replicating portfolio, the portfolio 
of non-maturity deposits is clustered by dimensions such as business unit, currency, product and geographical location. The 
main dimensions influencing the repricing maturity are elasticity of deposit rates to market interest rates, volatility of deposit 
balances and observable client behavior. For the reporting period the average repricing maturity assigned across all such 
replicating portfolios is 2.40 years and Deutsche Bank uses 15 years as the longest repricing maturity. 

In  the  loan  and  some  of  the  term  deposit  products  Deutsche  Bank  considers  early  prepayment/withdrawal  behavior  of  its 
customers. The parameters are based on historical observations, statistical analyses and expert assessments. 

Furthermore, the Group generally calculates IRRBB related metrics in contractual currencies and aggregates the resulting 
metrics  for  reporting  purposes.  When  calculating  economic  value  based  metrics  the  commercial  margin  is  excluded  for 
material parts of the balance sheet.

Credit Spread Risk in the Banking Book 

Deutsche Bank is exposed to credit spread risk of bonds held in the banking book, mainly as part of the Treasury Liquidity 
Reserves portfolio. The credit spread risk in the banking book is managed by the businesses, with Market Risk Management 
acting as an independent oversight function ensuring that the exposure is within the approved risk appetite. This risk category 
is  closely  associated  with  interest  rate  risk  in  the  banking  book  as  changes  in  the  perceived  credit  quality  of  individual 
instruments  may  result  in  fluctuations  in  spreads  relative  to  underlying  interest  rates.  The  calculation  of  credit  spread 
sensitivities  and  value-at-risk  for  credit  spread  exposure  is  in  general  performed  on  a  daily  basis,  the  measurement  and 
reporting of economic capital and stress tests are performed on a monthly basis. 

Foreign exchange risk 

Foreign exchange risk arises from non-trading asset and liability positions that are denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency of the respective entity. The majority of this foreign exchange risk is transferred through internal hedges 
to trading books within the Investment Bank and is therefore reflected and managed via the value-at-risk figures in the trading 
books.  The  remaining  foreign  exchange  risks  that  have  not  been  transferred  are  mitigated  through  match  funding  the 
investment in the  same currency, so that only residual risk remains in the portfolios. Small exceptions to above approach 
follow the general Market Risk Management monitoring and reporting process, as outlined for the trading portfolio. 

The  bulk  of  non-trading  open  foreign  exchange  risk  arises  from  the  foreign  exchange  translation  of  local  capital  into  the 
reporting currency of the Group and related capital hedge positions. Thereby structural open long positions are taken for a 
selected number of relevant currencies to immunize the sensitivity of the capital ratio of the Group against changes in the 
exchange rates. 

Equity and investment risk 

Non-trading equity risk is arising predominantly from our non-consolidated investment holdings in the banking book and from 
our equity compensation plans. 

Deutsche  Bank’s  non-consolidated  equity  investment  holdings  in  the  banking  book  are  categorized  into  strategic  and 
alternative  investment  assets.  Strategic  investments  typically  relate  to  acquisitions  made  to  support  the  bank’s  business 
franchise and are undertaken with a medium to long-term investment horizon. Alternative assets are comprised of principal 
investments and other non-strategic investment assets. Principal investments are direct investments in private equity, real 
estate, venture capital, hedge or mutual funds whereas assets recovered in the workout of distressed positions or other legacy 
investment assets in private equity and real estate are of a non-strategic nature.  

Investment proposals for strategic investments as well as monitoring of progress and performance against committed targets 
are evaluated by the Group Investment Committee. Depending on size, strategic investments may require approval from the 
Group Investment Committee, the Management Board or the Supervisory Board. 

Credit Risk Management Principal Investments is responsible for the risk-related governance and monitoring of our alternative 
asset  activities.  The  review  of  new  or  increased  principal  investment  commitments  is  the  task  of  the  Principal  Investment 
Commitment Approval Group, established by the Enterprise Risk Committee as a risk management forum for alternative asset 
investments. The Principal Investment Commitment Approval Group approves investments under its authority or recommends 
decisions above its authority to the Management Board for approval. The Management Board also sets investment limits for 
business divisions and various portfolios of risk upon recommendation by the Enterprise Risk Committee. 

The equity investment holdings are included in regular group wide stress tests and the monthly market risk economic capital 
calculations.

Pension risk 

The Group is exposed to market risks from defined benefit pension schemes for past and current employees. Market risks in 
pension plans materialize due to a potential decline in the market value of plan assets or an increase in the present value of 
the  pension  liability  of  each  of  the  pension  plans.  Market  Risk  Management  is  responsible  for  a  regular  measurement, 
monitoring, reporting and control of market risks of the asset and liability side of the defined benefit pension plans. Thereby, 
market risks in pension plans include but are not restricted to interest rate risk, inflation risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, and 
longevity risk. For further details on the Group’s defined benefit pension obligations and their management, please refer to 
Note 33 “Employee Benefits” in the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” section.  

Other risks in the Banking Book 

Market risks in the Asset Management business primarily result from principal guaranteed funds or accounts, but also from 
co-investments in the bank’s funds. 

Non-trading Market Risk Economic Capital 

Non-trading market risk economic capital is calculated either by applying the standard traded market risk EC methodology or 
through the use of non-traded market risk models that are specific to each risk class and which consider, among other factors, 
historically observed market moves, the liquidity of each asset class, and changes in client’s behavior in relation to products 
with behavioral optionality.

Operational risk management 

Operational Risk Management Framework 

Deutsche  Bank  applies  the  European  Banking  Authority’s  Single  Rulebook  definition  of  operational  risk:  “Operational  risk 
means the risk of losses stemming from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. 
Operational risk includes legal risks but excludes business and reputational risk and is embedded in all banking products and 
activities.” Operational risk forms a subset of the bank’s non-financial risks. 

Deutsche Bank’s operational risk appetite sets out the amount of operational risk it is willing to accept as a consequence of 
doing business. The bank takes on operational risks consciously, both strategically as well as in day-to-day business. While 
the  bank  may  have  no  appetite  for  certain  types  of  operational  risk  events  (such  as  violations  of  laws  or  regulations  and 
misconduct),  in  other  cases  a  certain  amount  of  operational  risk  must  be  accepted  if  the  bank  is  to  achieve  its  business 
objectives. In case a residual risk is assessed to be outside risk appetite, risk reducing actions must be undertaken, including 
remediating the risks, insuring risks or ceasing business. 

The Operational Risk Management Framework is a set of interrelated tools and processes that are used to identify, assess, 
mitigate  and  monitor  the  bank’s  operational  risks.  Its  components  have  been  designed  to  operate  together  to  provide  a 
comprehensive, risk-based approach to managing the bank’s most material operational risks. Operational Risk Management 
Framework components include the Group’s approach to setting and adhering to operational risk appetite, the operational risk 
type and control taxonomies, the policies and procedures for operational risk management processes including the respective 
tools, and the bank’s operational risk capital model. 

Organizational and governance structure 

While  the  day-to-day  management  of  operational  risk  is  the  primary  responsibility  of  business  divisions  and  infrastructure 
functions, where these risks are generated, Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM) oversees the Group-wide management 
of operational risks, identifies and reports risk concentrations, and promotes a consistent application of the Operational Risk 
Management Framework across the bank. NFRM is part of the Group’s risk function, the Chief Risk Office, which is headed 
by the Chief Risk Officer.  

The  Chief  Risk  Officer  appoints  the  Head  of  NFRM,  who  is  accountable  for  the  design,  oversight  and  maintenance  of  an 
effective, efficient and regulatory compliant Operational Risk Management Framework, including the operational risk capital 
model.  The  Head  of  NFRM  monitors  and  challenges  the  Operational  Risk  Management  Framework’s  Group  wide 
implementation and monitors overall risk levels against the bank’s operational risk appetite. 

The Non-Financial Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for the oversight, governance 
and coordination of the management of operational risk in the Group on behalf of the Management Board, by establishing a 
cross-risk and holistic perspective of the key operational risks of the Group. Its decision-making and policy related authorities 
include the review, advice and management of all operational risk issues that may impact the risk profile of business divisions 
and infrastructure functions. Several sub-fora with attendees from both the 1st LoD and 2nd LoD support the Non-Financial 
Risk Committee to effectively fulfil its mandate. In addition to the Group level Non-Financial Risk Committee, business divisions 
have established 1st LoD non-financial risk fora for the oversight and management of operational risks on various levels of 
the organization. 

The governance of operational risks follows the bank’s 3LoD approach to managing all of its financial and non-financial risks. 
The Operational Risk Management Framework establishes the operational risk governance standards including the core 1st 
and 2nd LoD roles and their responsibilities, to ensure effective risk management and appropriate independent challenge.  

Operational risk requirements for the 1st LoD: Risk owners as the 1st LoD have full accountability for their operational risks 
and manage these against a defined risk appetite.  

Risk owners are those roles in the bank whose activities generate - or who are exposed to - operational risks. As heads of 
business divisions and infrastructure functions, they must determine the appropriate organizational structure to identify their 
operational  risk  profile,  actively  manage  these  risks  within  their organization, take  business  decisions  on  the  mitigation  or 
acceptance of operational risks to ensure they remain within risk appetite, and establish and maintain 1st LoD controls. 

Operational risk requirements for the 2nd LoD: Risk Type Controllers act as the 2nd LoD control functions for all sub-risk types 
under the overarching risk type “Operational Risk”.

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Risk and Capital Management 
Operational risk management 

Risk Type Controllers establish the framework and define Group level risk appetite statements for the specific operational risk 
type  they  oversee.  Risk  Type  Controllers  define  the  minimum  risk  management  and  control  standards  and  independently 
monitor and challenge risk owners’ implementation of these standards  in their day-to-day processes, as well as their risk-
taking  and  risk  management  activities.  Risk  Type  Controllers  provide  independent  operational  risk  oversight  and  prepare 
aggregated risk type profile reporting. Risk Type Controllers monitor the risk type’s profile against risk appetite and have a 
right to veto risk decisions leading to foreseeable risk appetite breaches. As risk type experts, Risk Type Controllers define 
the risk type and its taxonomy and support and facilitate the implementation of the risk type framework in the 1st LoD. To 
maintain their independence, Risk Type Controller roles are located only in infrastructure functions.  

Operational risk requirements for NFRM as the Risk Type Controller for the overarching risk type “Operational Risk”: As the 
Risk Type Controller / risk control function for operational risk, NFRM establishes and maintains the overarching Operational 
Risk Management Framework and determines the appropriate level of capital to underpin the Group’s operational risk.  

–  As  the  2nd  LoD  risk  control  function,  NFRM  defines  the  bank’s  approach  to  operational  risk  appetite  and  monitors  its 
adherence,  breaches  and  consequences;  NFRM  is  the  independent  reviewer  and  challenger  of  the  1st  LoD’s  risk  and 
control assessments and risk management activities relating to the holistic operational risk profile of a unit (while Risk Type 
Controllers monitor and challenge activities related to their specific risk types). NFRM provides the oversight of risk and 
control  mitigation  plans  to  return  the  bank’s  operational  risk  to  its  risk  appetite,  where required;  it  also  establishes  and 
regularly reports the bank’s operational risk profile and operational top risks, i.e. the bank’s material operational risks which 
are outside of risk appetite 

–  As  the  subject  matter  expert  for  operational  risk,  NFRM  provides  independent  risk  views  to  facilitate  forward-looking 
management of operational risks, actively engages with risk owners (1st LoD) and facilitates the implementation of risk 
management and control standards across the bank 

–  NFRM is accountable for the design, implementation and maintenance of the approach to determine the adequate level of 
capital  required  for  operational  risk,  for  recommendation  to  the  Management  Board;  This  includes  the  calculation  and 
allocation of operational risk capital demand and expected loss under the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) 

Managing operational risk 

To  manage  the  broad  range  of  sub-risk  types  underlying  operational  risk,  the  Operational  Risk  Management  Framework 
provides  a  set  of  tools  and  processes  that  apply  to  all  operational  risk  types  across  the  bank.  These  enable  the  bank  to 
determine its operational risk profile in relation to risk appetite for operational risk, to systematically identify operational risk 
themes and concentrations, and to define risk mitigating measures and priorities. 

In  2023,  the  bank  continued  to  mature  the  management  of  operational  risk  by  further  integrating  and  simplifying  the  risk 
management  process.  This  was  achieved  through  enhancement  of  the  bank’s  central  controls  inventory;  upgrading  the 
application used to analyze operational risk loss events by integrating ‘lessons learned’ functionality; introduction of residual 
risk tolerance zones in the risk appetite framework and by extending framework adherence monitoring to also cover 2LoD 
activities 

Loss  data  collection:  Data  on  internal  and  relevant  external  operational  risk  events  (with  a  P&L  impact  ≥  € 10,000)  is 
independently validated in a timely manner. Material operational risk events trigger clearly defined lessons learned and read-
across analyses, which are performed in the 1st LoD in close collaboration between business partners, risk control and other 
infrastructure functions. Lessons learned reviews analyze the reasons for significant operational risk events, identify their root 
causes, and document appropriate remediation actions to reduce the likelihood of their reoccurrence. Read across reviews 
take  the  conclusions  of  the  lessons  learned  process  and  seek  to  analyze  whether  similar  risks  and  control  weaknesses 
identified in a lessons learned review exist in other areas of the bank, even if they have not yet resulted in problems or losses. 
This allows preventative actions to be undertaken. In 2023, lesson learned documentation functionality was integrated into the 
operational risk event management application (EMApp), allowing for direct technical linkage to the underlying operational risk 
event and enhanced lessons learned monitoring, governance and reporting. 

Scenario  analysis:  The  operational  risk  profile  is  complemented  and  further  substantiated  by  incorporating  exploratory 
scenario  analysis  into  day-to-day  risk  management  activities.  Scenario  analysis  is  used  as  a  risk  identiﬁcation  and 
management tool that enables risk owners and Risk Type Controllers to explore potential exposure to risk as the basis for 
identifying potential gaps in the banks existing operational risk profile. Furthermore, it is used as an input into the calculation 
of the operational risk capital for the bank. Scenario storylines build on internal losses, emerging risk reviews, top risks and 
risk concentrations, and findings, as well as the review of external peer operational risk loss events. Information from actual 
and potential future loss events are systematically utilized to identify thematic susceptibilities and actively seek to reduce the 
likelihood of similar incidents, for example through deep dive analyses or risk profile reviews. In 2023, the scenario analysis 
process has been strengthened by further tightening the roles and responsibilities within the 1st LoD and 2nd LoD in executing 
scenarios  and  scenario  analysis  continues  to  play  an  important  role  in  operational  resilience  exercises,  particularly  in 
assessing impacts of emerging risk themes. Additionally, work has started which will allow scenario analysis to be performed 
in the event management application (EMApp) in order to automate the capture, governance and reporting..

Operational risk management 

Risk & Control Assessment: The risk and control assessment process comprises of a series of bottom-up assessments of the 
risks generated by business divisions and infrastructure functions, the effectiveness of the controls in place to manage them, 
and the remediation actions required to bring the risks within the risk appetite perimeter. The Risk & Control Assessment is 
performed  at  a  global  business  level  and  as  such  covers  all  jurisdictions.  It  is  designed  to  assist  Senior  Management  to 
determine whether operational risks are being managed and controlled adequately via a dynamic assessment approach which 
covers  all  applicable  Risk  Types  from  the  Group’s  Non-Financial  Risk  Type  Taxonomy  (NFRTT).  The  Risk  &  Control 
Assessment  puts  a  greater  emphasis  on  assessing  and  mitigating  risks  that  are  outside  of  appetite  and  risks  that  drive 
unethical and inappropriate market conduct within the bank. 

Top risks: The Top Risk process is a regular process to identify the risks which pose greatest concern across Group and 
divisions, in addition to ensuring there is commensurate remediation activity associated to mitigate the risk. The associated 
Top Risk reporting provides a forward-looking perspective on the impact of top risk reduction programs, comprising of planned 
remediation and control enhancements, indicating the expected timeframe for reduction. The reporting also contains emerging 
risks and themes that have the potential to influence the top risk population in the future. The top risk identification process is 
closely connected to both the risk and control assessment and risk appetite, consuming the risk exposure from the former and 
the appetite levels from the latter to help inform the top risk population. 

Transformation Risk Assessment: To identify and appropriately manage risks from material change initiatives within the bank, 
a transformation risk assessment process is in place to assess the impact of transformation on the bank’s risk profile and 
control environment. The assessment considers impacts to financial and non-financial risk types and is mandatory for a subset 
of  initiatives,  categorized  as  key  deliverables  (typically  includes  regulatory  initiatives,  technology  migrations,  remediation 
initiatives, strategy and organizational changes). In 2023 the scope of the transformation risk assessment was expanded to 
cover to bank’s future joint ventures and strategic investments, to implement requirements of the bank’s updated Joint Venture 
and Strategic Investment Policy. 

Risk appetite: Non-financial risk appetite reflects the amount of non-financial risk the bank is willing to accept to pursue its 
strategy. The non-financial risk appetite framework provides a common approach to define the level of risk appetite across 
the  firm  and  monitor  exposure  against  this  appetite.  NFR  appetite  metrics  are  used  to  monitor  the  operational  risk  profile 
against the bank’s defined risk appetite, and to alert  the organization to impending problems in a  timely fashion. In 2023, 
design amendments have been made resulting in the introduction of residual risk tolerance zones which allow for a more 
precise articulation of tolerance for residual risk assessed by the risk and control assessment process. This introduces defined 
consequences for given combinations of likelihood and severity of impact for a given risk type. 

Findings  and  issue  management:  The  findings  and  issue  management  process  facilitates  the  bank  in  mitigating  the  risks 
associated with known control weaknesses and deficiencies, and enables management to make risk-based decisions over 
the  need  for  further  remediation  or  risk  acceptance.  Outputs  from  the  findings  management  process  must  be  able  to 
demonstrate to internal and external stakeholders that the bank is actively identifying its control weaknesses and taking steps 
to manage associated risks within acceptable levels of risk appetite. In 2023, Group Audit’s review and approval role in the 
lifecycle of Self-Identified Issues was enhanced. Additionally, the scope of the ‘Findings to Control’ linkage was expanded to 
cover all Risk Types and integrated in the Findings management tool. 

Framework Adherence: Operational Risk Framework Adherence is a key activity to oversee, monitor and test the conformity 
to  NFR  Framework  component  requirements  by  key  stakeholders.  Operational  Risk  Framework  Adherence  results  aim  to 
proactively identify implementation improvements required of users of the NFR Framework and highlight potential Framework 
design  improvements.  In  2023,  Operational  Risk  Framework  Adherence  monitoring  was  expanded  to  also  cover  2nd  LoD 
activities.

Operational risk type frameworks 

Operational risk is a risk type on the Group’s Risk Type Taxonomy. Together with Reputational Risk it forms Non-Financial 
risk.  The  Operational  Risk  Management  Framework  is  a  set  of  interrelated  tools  and  processes  that  are  used  to  identify, 
assess,  measure,  monitor  and  mitigate  Deutsche  Bank  Group’s  operational  risks  according  to  regulatory  and  industry-
established definition of operational risk. It applies to the operational sub-risk types on a more granular level and enables the 
bank  to  aggregate  and  monitor  its  operational  risk  profile.  These  operational  sub-risk  types  are  controlled  by  various 
infrastructure functions and include the following: 

–  The Compliance department performs an independent 2nd level control function that protects the bank’s license to operate 
by promoting and enforcing compliance with the law and driving a culture of compliance and ethical conduct in the bank; 
the Compliance department assists and challenges the business divisions and works with other infrastructure functions 
and  regulators  to  establish  and  maintain  a  risk-based  approach  to  the  management  of  the  bank’s  compliance  risks  in 
accordance with the bank’s risk appetite and to help the bank detect, mitigate and prevent breaches of laws and regulations; 
the Compliance department performs the following principal activities: the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring 
and  reporting  on  compliance  risk;  performs  second  level  controls;  the  results  of  these  assessments  and  controls  are 
regularly  reported  to  the  Management  Board  and  Supervisory  Board;  the  Compliance  department  also  assists  the 
Regulatory Management team with regulatory engagement 

–  Financial  crime  risks  are  managed  by  the  Anti-Financial  Crime  (AFC)  function  via  maintenance  and  development  of  a 
dedicated program; the AFC program is based on regulatory and supervisory requirements; AFC has defined roles and 
responsibilities and established dedicated functions for the identification and management of financial crime risks resulting 
from money laundering, terrorism financing, compliance with sanctions and embargoes, the facilitation of tax evasion as 
well  as  other  criminal  activities  including  fraud,  bribery  and  corruption  and  other  crimes;  AFC  updates  its  strategy  for 
financial  crime  prevention  via  regular  development  of  internal  policies  processes  and  controls,  institution-specific  risk 
assessment and staff training 

–  The Legal department is a fully independent infrastructure function, mandated to provide legal advice to the Management 
Board, the Supervisory Board (restricted to matters that do not give rise to conflict of interest), corporate divisions and 
infrastructure functions, and to support the Management Board in setting up and guarding the bank’s corporate governance 
framework and manage the bank’s legal corporate governance framework, antitrust legal and data privacy risk 
The Legal Department carries out its mandate through the following responsibilities: 
–  Advising the Management Board and Supervisory Board on legal aspects of their activities 
–  Providing legal advice to all Deutsche Bank units to facilitate adherence to legal and regulatory requirements in relation 

to their activities respectively 

–  Supporting other bank units managing Deutsche Bank Group’s interactions with regulatory authorities

managing Deutsche Bank Group’s response to external regulatory enforcement investigations 

–  Establishing appropriate processes for the preparation, review and execution of transactional documentation 
–  Preserving documents in connection with the management of Continuous Matters by issuing Legal Holds 
–  Advising on legal aspects of internal investigations 
–  Setting the global governance framework for Deutsche Bank Group, facilitating its cross-unit application and assessing 

its implementation 

–  Developing and safeguarding efficient corporate governance structures suitable to support efficient decision-making, to 

align risk and accountability based on clear and consistent roles and responsibilities 

–  Maintaining Deutsche Bank Group’s framework for policies, procedures, framework and key operating documents and 

serving in particular as guardian for the same 

–  Setting the framework for the establishment, composition and functioning of joint decision-making bodies, ensuring its 
consistent implementation and providing a framework and platforms for sustainable, and auditable documentation of 
decision-making events, allowing for central swift retrieval of information 
–  Setting the framework for and facilitating the legal entity approval processes 
–  Advising on internal corporate governance topics to ensure the implementation of the governance frameworks, including 
the analysis of corporate governance specific laws and regulations, interaction with supervisors on internal corporate

–  Advising on data privacy laws, rules and regulation and maintaining Deutsche Bank Group´s data privacy risk and control 

framework 

–  Ensuring appropriate quality assurance in relation to all of the above 

–  Deutsche Bank’s New Product Approval and Systematic Product Review processes form a control framework designed to 
manage  the  risks  associated  with  new  products  and  services  and  their  lifecycle  management;  these  processes  are 
overseen by Product Governance, within the Non-Financial Risk function; existing products and services are reviewed in 
one- to three year cycles designed to assess whether they remain fit for purpose and consistent with their respective target 
markets’ characteristics and objectives; each product or service must be sponsored by a business Managing Director who 
bears ultimate accountability for it; breaches of the New Product Approval requirements are in scope of the bank’s Red 
Flag consequence management process 

–  NFRM is the Risk Type Controller for a number of operational resilience risks; its mandate includes second line oversight 
of controls over transaction processing activities, as well as infrastructure risks to prevent technology or process disruption, 
maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, records and information security, and ensure business divisions 
and infrastructure functions have robust plans in place to recover critical business processes and functions in the event of 
disruption including technical or building outage, or the effects of cyber-attack or natural disaster as well as any physical 
security or safety risk; NFRM Risk Type Controller also manages the risks arising from the bank’s internal and external 
vendor engagements via the provision of a comprehensive third party risk management framework 

Measuring Operational Risks 

Deutsche  Bank  calculates  and  measures  the  regulatory  and  economic  capital  requirements  for  operational  risk  using  the 
Advanced  Measurement  Approach  (AMA)  methodology.  The  AMA  capital  calculation  is  based  upon  the  loss  distribution 
approach. Gross losses from historical internal and external loss data (Operational Riskdata eXchange Association consortium 
data)  complemented  by  scenario  data  are  used  to  estimate  the  risk  profile  (i.e.,  a  loss  frequency  and  a  loss  severity 
distribution).  The  loss  distribution  approach  model  includes  conservatism  by  recognizing  losses  on  events  that  arise  over 
multiple years as single events in the historical loss profile. 

Within the loss distribution approach model, the frequency and severity distributions are combined in a Monte Carlo simulation 
to generate potential losses over a one-year time horizon. Finally, the risk mitigating benefits of insurance are applied to each 
loss generated in the Monte Carlo simulation. Correlation and diversification benefits are applied to the net losses in a manner 
compatible with regulatory requirements to arrive at a net loss distribution at Group level, covering expected and unexpected 
losses. Capital is then allocated to each of the business divisions considering qualitative adjustments after deducting expected 
loss. 

The regulatory and economic capital requirements for operational risk is derived from the 99.9% percentile; see the section 
“Internal Capital Adequacy” for details. Both regulatory and economic capital requirements are calculated for a time horizon 
of one year. 

The  regulatory  and  economic  capital  demand  calculations  are  performed  on  a  quarterly  basis.  NFRM  establishes  and 
maintains the approach for capital demand quantification and ensures that appropriate development, validation and change 
governance processes are in place, whereby the validation is performed by an independent validation function and in line with 
the Group’s model risk management process.

Drivers for operational risk capital development  

By design of the AMA capital calculation, Deutsche Bank’s operational risk capital demand is predominantly driven by historical 
internal  loss  events.  In  view  of  the  relevance  of  legal  risks  within  the  bank’s  operational  risk  profile,  specific  attention  is 
dedicated to the management and measurement of open civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters where the bank 
relies both on information from internal as well as external data sources to consider developments in legal matters that affect 
the  bank  specifically  but  also  the  banking  industry  as  a  whole.  Reflecting  the  multi-year  nature  of  legal  proceedings  the 
measurement of these risks furthermore takes into account changing levels of certainty by capturing the risks at various stages 
throughout the lifecycle of a legal matter.  

Conceptually, the bank measures operational risk including legal risk by determining the annual operational risk loss that will 
not be exceeded with a given probability. This loss amount is driven by a component that due to the IFRS criteria is reflected 
in the bank’s financial statements and a component beyond the amount reflected as provisions within the bank’s financial 
statements. 

The legal losses which the bank expects with a likelihood of more than 50% are already reflected in the IFRS group financial 
statements. These losses include net changes in provisions for existing and new cases in a specific period where the loss is 
deemed probable and is reliably measurable in accordance with IAS 37. 

Uncertain legal losses which are not reflected in the bank’s financial statements as provisions because they do not meet the 
recognition criteria under IAS 37 are considered within regulatory or economic capital demand. 

To quantify the litigation losses in the AMA model, the bank takes into account historical losses, provisions, contingent liabilities 
and legal forecasts. Legal forecasts generally comprise ranges of potential losses covering risks of outflows greater than the 
provision and topside adjustments which are deemed remote or relate to yet unknown matters. Such forecasts may result 
from ongoing and new legal matters which are reviewed at least quarterly by the attorneys handling the legal matters. 

The legal forecasts are included in the “relevant loss data” used in the AMA model. The projection range of the legal forecasts 
is not restricted to the one year capital time horizon but goes beyond and conservatively assumes early settlement of the 
underlying losses in the reporting period - thus considering the multi-year nature of legal matters.

Risk and Capital Management 
Liquidity risk management 

Liquidity risk management  

Liquidity risk arises from Deutsche Bank Group’s potential inability to meet payment obligations when they come due or without 
incurring excessive costs. The Group’s risk taxonomy differentiates between two aspects of liquidity risk: Short-term liquidity 
risk and Structural funding risk, both embedded in one liquidity risk management framework. Its objective is to ensure that all 
necessary governance and controls are established within the Group to fulfil its payment obligations at all times (including 
intraday) and to manage its liquidity and funding risks within the Management Board approved risk appetite, when executing 
the strategic plan. The framework considers relevant and significant drivers of liquidity risk, whether on-balance sheet or off-
balance sheet. 

Liquidity and funding risk framework 

The  Management  Board  defines  the  liquidity  and  funding  risk  strategy  for  the  Group and  sets  the  risk  appetite,  based  on 
recommendations made by the Group Asset and Liability Committee and Group Risk Committee. The Management Board 
reviews and approves the risk appetite at least annually. The risk appetite is applied to the Group and to bespoke Key Liquidity 
Entities e.g., Deutsche Bank AG to monitor and control liquidity risk as well as the Group’s long-term funding and issuance 
plan. 

The Liquidity Risk Management Framework defines the organization of the liquidity managing functions in alignment with the 
three lines of defense structure, which is described in the “Risk Management Policy”. The Corporate Divisions and Treasury 
comprise the first line of defense, responsible for executing the steps needed to most effectively manage the liquidity of the 
Group  and  steer  business  activities.  Risk  comprises  the  second  line  of  defense,  responsible  for  defining  the  liquidity  risk 
management framework, providing independent risk oversight, challenge, and validation of activities conducted  by the first 
line  of  defense,  including  establishing  the  risk  appetite.  Group  Audit  comprises  the  third  line  of  defense,  responsible  for 
overseeing the activities of both the first line of defense and second line of defense. 

The Group Asset and Liability Committee is the Group’s decisive governing body mandated by the Management Board to 
optimize  the  sourcing  and  deployment  of  the  Group’s  balance  sheet and  financial  resources  in  line  with  the  Management 
Board’s  risk  appetite  and  strategy.  The  Group  Asset  and  Liability  Committee  has  the  overarching  responsibility  to  define, 
approve  and  optimize  the  Group’s  funding  strategy.  Regarding  the  second  line  of  defense  the  Group  Risk  Committee  is 
mandated  by  the  Management  Board  with  decision-making  authority  regarding  material  risk-related  topics.  In  addition,  it 
reviews and recommends items for Management Board approval, including key risk management principles, the Group’s risk 
appetite  statement,  recovery  plan,  the  contingency  funding  plan,  over-arching  risk  appetite  parameters,  and  recovery  and 
escalation indicators. 

The  Group’s  liquidity  risk  management  principles  are  documented  in  the  “Liquidity  Risk  Management  Policy”  and  the 
framework is described in the “Global Liquidity Risk Framework” and “Global Funding Risk Framework” documents. Both the 
policy and framework documents adhere to and articulate how the eight key risk management practices are applied to liquidity 
risk, namely risk governance, risk organization (3 lines of defense), risk culture, risk appetite and -strategy, risk identification 
and -assessment, risk mitigation and controls, risk measurement and reporting, stress planning and -execution. The individual 
roles and responsibilities are laid out and documented in the Global Responsibility Matrix, which provides further clarity and 
transparency on the roles and responsibilities across all involved stakeholders. All additional policies and procedures (both 
global and local) issued by the liquidity risk management functions further define the requirements specific to liquidity risk 
practices. They are subordinate to the “Liquidity Risk Management Policy” and are subject to the standards it sets forth. 

In accordance with the European Central Bank’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (and revised Internal Liquidity 
Adequacy  Assessment  Process  requirement  issued  in  November  2018),  the  Group  has  implemented  an  Internal  Liquidity 
Adequacy  Assessment  Process,  which  is  assessed,  documented  and  reviewed  at  least  annually  and  approved  by  the 
Management Board. 

As part of an annual strategic planning process, Treasury projects the development of the key liquidity and funding metrics 
including the U.S. Dollar currency exposure based on anticipated business activities to ensure that the strategic plan can be 
executed in accordance with the Group’s risk appetite.

Liquidity risk management 

Risk appetite and control setting  

The Group’s liquidity risk appetite, which is defined through qualitative principles and supporting quantitative metrics, is laid 
out in the “Risk Appetite Statement” and is subject to the standards defined in the “Risk Appetite Policy”. This Risk Appetite 
Statement is further underpinned by the liquidity risk controls framework consisting of ”Key Limits” based on risk appetite, as 
well as a suite of additional limits, thresholds and early warning indicators. 

Deutsche Bank implemented a dedicated Risk Appetite framework covering regulatory Pillar 1as well as internal stress metrics 
(Pillar 2) which are defined by Liquidity Risk Management and ensure the Group’s liquidity  position is balanced across the 
Group, its Key Liquidity Entities and across currencies. 

Treasury  manages  liquidity  and  funding,  in  accordance  with  the  risk  appetite  across  a  range  of  relevant  metrics  and 
implements several tools including business level risk appetite limits further cascading aspects of risk appetite to divisional 
level, to ensure compliance. As such, Treasury works closely with Liquidity Risk Management under its delegated authority 
and the business divisions to identify, analyze and monitor underlying liquidity risk characteristics within business portfolios. 
These  parties  are  engaged  in  regular  dialogue  regarding  changes  in  the  Group’s  liquidity  position  arising  from  business 
activities and market circumstances. 

Furthermore,  the  Group ensures  at  the  level  of  each  liquidity  relevant  entity that all  local liquidity  metrics  are  managed  in 
compliance with the defined risk appetite. Local liquidity surpluses are pooled in Deutsche Bank AG hubs and local liquidity 
shortfalls  can  be  met  through  support  from  these  hubs.  Transfers  of  liquidity  capacity  between  entities  are  subject  to  the 
approval framework involving the Group’s liquidity steering function as well as the local liquidity managers considering the 
compliance with Pillar 1 metrics like Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as well as stressed 
Net Liquidity Position (sNLP), which is a Pillar 2 metric. Available surplus that resides in entities with restriction to transfer 
liquidity to other Group entities, for example due to regulatory lending requirements, is treated as trapped and as such not 
considered in the calculation of the consolidated Group liquidity surplus. 

The Management Board is informed about the Group’s performance against the key liquidity metrics, including the risk appetite 
and internal and market indicators, via a weekly liquidity dashboard. 

Liquidity risk monitoring and management  

Finance - Liquidity & Treasury Reporting & Analysis (LTRA) and Finance - Global Reporting – LTRA together have overall 
accountability for the accurate and timely production of both external regulatory liquidity reporting (Pillar 1) as well as internal 
management  reporting  (Pillar  2)  for  liquidity  risk  of  the  Group.  In  addition,  Liquidity  &  Treasury  Reporting  &  Analysis  is 
responsible  for  the  development  of  management  information  systems and  the  related  analysis  to  support  the  liquidity  risk 
framework and its governance for Treasury and Liquidity Risk Management. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

The LCR which is also a key limit is intended to promote the short-term resilience of a bank’s liquidity risk profile over a 30-
day stress scenario. The ratio is defined as the amount of High-Quality Liquid Assets that could be used to raise liquidity in a 
stressed  scenario,  measured  against  the  total  volume  of  net  cash  outflows,  arising  from  both  contractual  and  prescribed 
modelled exposures over a 30-day time horizon on a consolidated currency basis. 

By  maintaining  a  ratio  in  excess  of  the  minimum  regulatory  requirements,  the  LCR  seeks  to  ensure  that  the  Group  holds 
adequate liquidity resources to mitigate a short-term liquidity stress. 

Key differences between the internal liquidity stress test (sNLP) and the LCR include the time horizon (eight weeks versus 30 
days),  the  classification  and  haircut  differences  between  debt securities  within  the  sNLP  and the  LCR  High-Quality  Liquid 
Assets, outflow rates for various categories of funding, as well as inflow assumption for various assets (for example, loan 
repayments). The Group’s internal liquidity stress test also includes outflows related to intraday liquidity assumptions, which 
are not explicitly reflected in the LCR.

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

The Net Stable Funding Ratio is a regulatory metric for assessing a Bank’s structural funding profile. The NSFR is intended 
to reduce medium to long-term funding risks by requiring banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and 
off-balance sheet activities. The ratio is defined as the amount of Available Stable Funding (the portion of capital and liabilities 
expected  to  be  a  stable  source  of  funding),  relative  to  the  amount  of  Required  Stable  Funding  (a  function  of  the  liquidity 
characteristics of various assets held). 

Based on risk appetite a NSFR key limit has been set for the Group as well as for all Key Liquidity Entities and liquidity relevant 
entities subject to a respective regulatory requirement to ensure compliance to it. 

Liquidity stress testing and scenario analysis 

Global internal liquidity stress testing and scenario analysis is used for measuring liquidity risk and evaluating the Group’s 
short-term liquidity position within the liquidity framework. This complements the daily operational cash management process. 
The long-term liquidity strategy based on contractual and behavioral modelled cash flow information is represented by a long-
term metric known as the Funding Matrix (refer to Funding risk management and funding diversification below). 

The global liquidity stress testing process is managed by Treasury towards a respective risk appetite. Treasury is responsible 
for the design of the overall methodology, the choice of liquidity risk drivers and the determination of appropriate assumptions 
(parameters) to translate input data into stress testing output. Liquidity Risk Management is responsible for the definition of 
the  stress  scenarios.  Under  the  principles  and  policy  requirements  laid  out  by  Model  Risk  Management,  Liquidity  Risk 
Management  and  Model  Risk  Management  perform  the  independent  validation  of  liquidity  risk  models  and  non-model 
estimates.  Finance  -Liquidity  &  Treasury  Reporting  &  Analysis  and  Finance  -  Global  Reporting  are  responsible  for 
implementing  these  methodologies  and  performing  the  stress  test  calculation  in  conjunction  with  Treasury,  Liquidity  Risk 
Management, Group Strategic Analytics and IT. 

Stress testing and scenario analysis are used to describe and evaluate the impact of sudden and severe stress events on the 
Group’s liquidity position. Deutsche Bank has selected four scenarios to calculate the Group’s stressed Net Liquidity Position. 
These  scenarios  are  designed  to  capture  potential  outcomes  which  may  be  experienced  by  the  Group.  The  most  severe 
scenario  assesses  the  potential  consequences  of  a  combined  market-wide  and  idiosyncratic  stress  event,  including 
downgrades of Deutsche Bank credit rating. Under each of the scenarios, the impact of a liquidity stress event over different 
time horizons and across multiple liquidity risk drivers, covering all business lines and product areas and with that all portfolios 
and balance sheet, is considered. The output from this scenario analysis feeds the Group Wide Stress Test, which considers 
the impact of scenarios across all risk stripes. 

In addition, potential funding requirements from contingent liquidity risks which can arise under stress, including drawdowns 
on  lending  facilities,  increased  collateral  requirements  under  derivative  agreements,  and  outflows  from  deposits  with  a 
contractual rating linked trigger are included in the analysis. Subsequently, countermeasures, which are the actions the Group 
would  take  to  counterbalance  the  outflows  incurred  during  a  stress  event,  are  taken  into  consideration.  Those 
countermeasures  include  the  usage  of  the  Group’s  liquidity  reserve  and  generating  liquidity  from  other  unencumbered, 
marketable assets without causing any material impact on the Group’s business model. 

Stress testing is conducted at a global level and for defined entities relevant for liquidity risk management. The stress analysis 
covers an eight-week stress horizon which is considered to be the most critical time span during a liquidity crisis requiring that 
liquidity is actively assessed and steered on a Group level. In addition to the consolidated currency stress test, further stress 
tests are performed for material currencies. On a global level and in the U.S. liquidity stress tests a twelve-months period is 
covered. Additionally, stress test results are monitored over a twelve-month period with specific risk limits, if required by local 
regulators. Ad-hoc analysis may be conducted to reflect the impact of potential downside events that could affect the Group 
such as climate / ESG-related events. Relevant stress assumptions are applied to reflect liquidity flows from risk drivers and 
on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet products. The suite of stress testing scenarios and assumptions are reviewed on a 
regular basis and are updated when enhancements are made to stress testing methodologies. 

Complementing the daily liquidity stress testing, the Group also conducts regular group-wide stress tests run by Enterprise 
Risk Management, which analyze liquidity risks in conjunction with the other defined risk types and evaluate their impact and 
interplay to both capital and liquidity positions as described in “Risk and Capital Framework - Stress testing”.

Funding Risk Management and Funding Diversification 

Funding Management 

In line with regulatory guidelines, Deutsche Bank has developed a set of internal indicators to measure its inherent funding 
risks. These are considered for steering purposes in addition to the regulatory metric Net Stable Funding Ratio. 

The Group relies on a vast range of funding sources such as e.g. deposits, unsecured wholesale funding, Capital Markets 
Issuances and secured funding. These protect its liquidity position twofold. Firstly, since stress events may impact funding 
markets  differently,  maintaining  a  well-diversified  funding  portfolio will lower the  average impact  of  these. Secondly,  when 
experiencing liquidity stress, having access to a wide range of funding sources significantly improves the Group’s ability to tap 
different funding markets. The diversification across products is complemented by Risk thresholds in order to monitor tenor 
concentration and counterparty concentration for both secured and unsecured funding sources.  

In addition, the stability of Deutsche Bank Group’s funding position can be negatively impacted by various forms of industry 
risks. These are typically medium to long term structural trends with potentially significant long-term impact on the economy 
and consequently on banks’ balance sheets. Deutsche Bank is performing ad-hoc analyzes on such emerging risks to assess 
the impact of such trends on its funding position to ensure that mitigating measures will be taken well in time when deemed 
necessary. In addition, Treasury evaluates current market access information in its significant funding markets on a regular 
basis. Market access information is compiled monthly and presented to Group Asset and Liability Committee. 

The  Group’s  primary  internal  tool  for  monitoring  and  managing  structural  funding  risk  is  the  Funding  Matrix.  The  Funding 
Matrix assesses the Group’s structural funding profile over a time horizon beyond one year. To produce the Funding Matrix, 
all  funding-relevant  assets  and  liabilities  are  mapped  into  time  buckets  corresponding  to  their  contractual  or  modelled 
maturities. This allows the Group to identify expected excesses and shortfalls in term liabilities over assets in each time bucket, 
facilitating the management of potential liquidity exposures. 

The  liquidity  profile  is  based  on  contractual  cash  flow information. If  the  contractual  maturity profile  of  a  product does  not 
adequately reflect the liquidity profile, it is replaced by modelling assumptions. Short-term balance sheet items (less than one 
year) or matched funded structures (asset and liabilities directly matched with no liquidity risk) are excluded from the term 
analysis.  

The bottom-up assessment by individual business line is combined with a top-down reconciliation against the Group’s IFRS 
balance sheet. From the cumulative term profile of assets and liabilities beyond 1 year, long-funded surpluses or short-funded 
gaps in the Group’s maturity structure can be identified. The cumulative profile is thereby built up starting from the “greater 
than ten-year” bucket down to the “greater than one-year” bucket. The Funding Matrix is also undertaken for material foreign 
currencies i.e. USD.  

To diversify our refinancing activities Deutsche Bank actively uses among others Capital Markets Issuance. 

Capital Markets Issuance 

The main objective of debt issuance is to raise medium term funding and securing in the most cost optimal manner. Debt 
issuance, encompassing senior unsecured bonds, covered bonds, and capital securities, is a key source of term funding for 
the  Group  and  is  managed  directly  by  Treasury.  At  least  once  a  year,  following  endorsement  by  the  Asset  and  Liability 
Committee, Treasury submits an annual long-term funding plan to the Group Risk Committee for recommendation and then 
to  Management  Board  for  approval.  This  plan  is  driven  by  global  and  local  funding  and  liquidity  requirements  based  on 
expected  business  development.  The  Group’s  capital  markets  issuance  portfolio  is  dynamically  managed  through  annual 
issuance plans to avoid excessive maturity concentrations. 

Deutsche Bank holds a license to issue mortgage Pfandbriefe and maintains a program to issue structured covered bonds. 
Additionally, the Group continues to run a program for the purpose of issuing covered bonds under Spanish law (Cedulas). In 
2023, Deutsche Bank further diversified its investor base through inaugural transactions in China (so-called Panda bonds). 
Since 2020 the Group maintains its Green Bond framework which the bank continuously expands to offer green note issuances 
to  both,  institutional  and  retail  investors.  Furthermore,  multiple green  structured  notes,  first  green deposits  and  first  green 
repurchase agreements (repos) were executed. In 2023, the Group concluded on integrating the legacy bond portfolio from 
former Postbank activities into Deutsche Bank’s infrastructure, leading to a uniform platform for all issuances.

Liquidity risk management 

Risk Mitigation 

High Quality Liquid Assets 

High-quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) is a Pillar 1 calculation which feeds into LCR and, since the beginning of the fourth quarter 
2023 is a key limit per the risk appetite, replacing Liquidity Reserve. HQLA comprise available cash and cash equivalents and 
unencumbered high quality liquid securities (including government and government guaranteed bonds), representing the most 
readily available and most important countermeasure in a stress event. 

The vast majority of the Group’s HQLA are held centrally across major currencies at the central bank accounts of the parent 
entity and foreign branches in the key locations in which we are active and in a dedicated Treasury-owned Strategic Liquidity 
Reserves portfolio, set up exclusively to serve as a mitigant during periods of stress.  

Asset Encumbrance 

Encumbered assets primarily comprise those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are pledged as collateral against secured 
funding, collateral swaps, and other collateralized obligations. Generally, loans are encumbered to support long-term capital 
markets  secured  issuance  such  as  covered  bonds  or  other  self-securitization  structures,  while  financing  debt  and  equity 
inventory on a secured basis is a regular activity for the Investment Bank business. Additionally, in line with the European 
Banking Authority technical standards on regulatory asset encumbrance reporting, assets pledged with settlement systems 
(including  default  funds  and  initial  margins)  as  well  as  other  assets  pledged  which  cannot  be  freely  withdrawn  such  as 
mandatory minimum reserves at central banks are considered encumbered assets. Derivative margin receivable assets as 
encumbered under these European Banking Authority guidelines are also included. 

Funds transfer pricing 

The funds transfer pricing framework is key to incentivize liquidity steering activities to the business units. It  applies to all 
Corporate  Divisions  and  entities  with  balance  sheet  items  requiring  active  management  and  funding  from  the  Group  and 
promotes pricing of (i) assets in accordance with their underlying liquidity risk, (ii) liabilities in accordance with their liquidity 
value and (iii) contingent liquidity exposures in accordance with the cost of providing for appropriate High Quality Liquid Assets. 

Within this framework funding and liquidity risk costs and benefits are allocated to the Group’s business units based on rates 
which reflect the economic costs of liquidity for Deutsche Bank. Treasury might set further financial incentives in line with the 
Group’s liquidity risk guidelines. While the framework promotes a diligent Group-wide allocation of its funding costs to the 
liquidity users, it also provides an incentive-based framework for businesses generating stable long-term and stress compliant 
funding. 

Throughout 2023, the Bank continued to deliver against improvements of the changes to the internal Funds Transfer Pricing 
framework started in 2019 aimed at enhancing its effectiveness as a management tool, as well as better supporting funding 
cost optimization. Additional details are included in Note 4 „Business segments and related information“ of the consolidated 
financial statements. 

Contingency Funding Planning 

Deutsche Bank’s Group Contingency Funding Plan outlines how Deutsche Bank would respond to an actual or anticipated 
liquidity stress event. It specifies the provisions, procedures and action plans for responding to potential disruptions to the 
Bank’s ability to fund itself. It covers actions that can be taken to raise cash and/or recover the Bank’s liquidity metrics  in 
breach. The Contingency Funding Plan outlines governance arrangements for its activation and presents the framework of 
liquidity indicators enabling the Bank to identify deteriorating market circumstances in a timely manner and that determine 
quickly what actions need to be taken, incl. communication and coordination during a liquidity stress event. Deutsche Bank 
has established the Financial Resource Management Council, which is responsible for oversight of capital and liquidity across 
contingency, recovery, and resolution scenarios in a defined crisis situation.

Risk and Capital Management 
Enterprise risk management 

Enterprise risk management 

Enterprise  Risk  Management  (ERM)  provides  a  holistic  view  of  the  Bank’s  risk  profile  across  risk  types,  businesses  and 
geographies. Key responsibilities include: 

–  Defining the overarching risk management policy, including setting of risk management standards. 
–  Setting and monitoring the Bank’s overarching risk appetite and cascading to business & entity dimensions. 
–  Delivering insight through emerging risks and trends analysis, forward-looking stress tests, portfolio concentration, deep-

dive analyses and ad-hoc event reporting. 

–  Overseeing the Bank’s internal capital adequacy process, including capital risk appetite. 
–  Coordinating and implementing the group recovery plan and maintaining credible resolution plans that could be executed 

in a crisis. 

–  Developing and managing the climate risk management framework. 
–  Providing risk reporting and analytics to key stakeholders, including senior management and regulators. 
–  Acting as risk controlling function for credit risk. 

Strategic risk  

Strategic risk is the risk of a shortfall in planned earnings (excluding other material risks) due to incorrect business plans, 
ineffective plan execution, or inability to effectively respond to material plan deviations. Strategic risk arises from the exposure 
of  the  bank  to  the  macroeconomic  environment,  changes  in  the  competitive  landscape,  and  regulatory  and  technological 
developments.  Additionally,  it  could  occur  due  to  errors  in  strategic  positioning,  the  bank’s  failure  to  execute  its  planned 
strategy and/or a failure to effectively address underperformance versus plan targets. 

The strategic plan is developed annually and presented to the Management Board for discussion and approval. The final plan 
is presented to the Supervisory Board. The plan is challenged in an iterative process with respect to its assumptions, credibility 
and  integrity.  During  the  year,  execution  of  business  strategies  is  regularly  monitored  to  assess  the  performance  against 
targets. A more comprehensive description of this process is detailed in the section ‘Strategic and Capital Plan’. 

Strategic  risk  is  measured  through  a  dedicated  risk  model  that  quantifies  potential  losses  caused  by  unexpected  pre-tax 
earnings shortfalls that cannot be offset by cost reductions under extreme but plausible market conditions over a 12-month 
period. Strategic risk appetite is also established for the Group via dedicated metrics. 

The Business Divisions and Infrastructure Functions are the 1st LoD that own the risk and have the responsibility to manage 
strategic risk in accordance with the plan approved by the Management Board. Finance and Risk are the 2nd LoD and act as 
facilitators via their controlling activities, and are responsible for escalation to the appropriate decision-taking authorities.  

Capital risk 

Capital risk is defined as the risk that Deutsche Bank has an insufficient level or composition of capital supply to support its 
current and planned business activities and associated risks during normal and stressed conditions. 

The bank’s capital risk framework consists of several elements which aim to ensure that Deutsche Bank maintains on an 
ongoing basis an adequate capitalization to cover the risks to which is exposed. The framework is strongly integrated with the 
bank-wide strategic planning process and closely linked to Deutsche Bank’s internal capital adequacy assessment process 
(see section “Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process” for further details). Treasury together with the divisions is the 
key risk manager of the associated risks and represents the 1st LoD. ERM acts as the 2nd LoD for capital risk. 

Treasury  function  manages  capital  risk  at  group  level  and  locally  in  each  region,  as  applicable.  This  includes  managing 
issuances and repurchases of capital instruments (see section on “Capital management” for details). Additionally, divisional 
limits for key capital resources are approved by the Group Asset and Liability Committee to ensure alignment with the capital 
risk appetite (see section on “Resource limit setting” for details). 

ERM  sets  the  capital  risk  framework,  assesses  the  capital  risk  profile  and  provides  independent  challenge.  This  includes 
setting of risk appetite thresholds for key capital ratios. Threshold breaches are subject to a dedicated governance framework 
triggering management actions up to the execution of Deutsche Bank’s recovery plan. Thresholds also provide boundaries to 
the capital plan and are fully integrated into the regular assessment of capital risk under stress scenarios.

Enterprise risk management 

Portfolio concentration risk  

Risk concentrations refer to clusters of the same or similar risk drivers within specific risk types (intra-risk concentrations in 
credit, market, operational and strategic risks) as well as across different risk types (inter-risk concentrations). They occur 
within and across counterparties, businesses, regions/countries, industries and products. The management and monitoring of 
risk concentrations is achieved through a quantitative and qualitative approach, as follows: 

–  Intra-risk concentrations are assessed, monitored and mitigated by the individual risk functions (enterprise, credit, market, 
operational and liquidity risk management). This is supported by risk appetite including limit setting on different levels and/or 
management according to each risk type 

–  Inter-risk  concentrations  are  managed  through  quantitative  top-down  stress-testing  and  qualitative  bottom-up  reviews, 
identifying  and  assessing  risk  themes  independent  of  any  risk  type  and  providing  a  holistic  view  across  the  bank.  The 
diversification effects between credit, market, operational and strategic risk are measured through a dedicated risk model 
that quantifies the diversification benefit caused by non-perfect correlations between these risk types. The calculation of 
the risk type diversification benefit is intended to ensure that the standalone economic capital figures for the individual risk 
types are aggregated in an economically meaningful way 

The most senior governance body for the oversight of risk concentrations is the Group Risk Committee (GRC). 

Environmental, social and governance risk 

The impacts of rising global temperatures, the enhanced focus on climate change and the transition to a net-zero economy 
from society, regulators and the banking sector have led to the emergence of new and increasing sources of financial and 
non-financial risks. These include the physical risks arising from extreme weather events, which are growing in frequency and 
severity, as well as transition risks as carbon intensive sectors are faced with higher taxation, reduced demand and potentially 
restricted access to financing. These risks can impact Deutsche Bank across a broad range of financial and non-financial risk 
types.  

Financial institutions are facing increased scrutiny on climate and broader ESG-related issues from governments, regulators, 
shareholders and other bodies, leading to reputational risks if the Group is not seen to support the transition to a lower carbon 
economy,  to  protect  biodiversity  and  human  rights.  Deutsche Bank is  reviewing  and  enhancing  its  ESG risk  management 
frameworks  in  alignment  with  regulatory  guidance  and  to  ensure  that  we  actively  manage  ESG  risks  and  prevent 
greenwashing. Data, methodologies and industry standards for measuring and assessing climate and other environmental 
risks are still evolving or, in certain cases, are not yet available. This, combined with a lack of comprehensive and consistent 
climate and other environmental risk disclosures by its clients means that the bank, in line with the wider industry,  remains 
partially reliant on proxy estimates and qualitative approaches when assessing these risks which introduces a higher degree 
of uncertainty into climate-related disclosures. 

Financial  institutions  are  facing  increased  scrutiny  as  well  as  reporting  requirements  on  climate  and  broader  ESG-related 
issues from governments, regulators, shareholders and other bodies. This can lead to reputational risks if the bank is not seen 
to support the transition to a lower carbon economy or is perceived to be heavily involved in the financing of activities harmful 
to nature or linked to human rights abuse within supply chains. 

Certain  jurisdictions  have  begun  to  develop  anti-ESG  measures  including  requiring  financial  institutions  that  wish  to  do 
business  with  them  to  certify  their  non-adherence  to  aspects  of  the  transition  agenda.  Failing  to  comply  with  these 
requirements  may  result  in  the  termination  of  existing  business  and  the  inability  to  conduct  new  business  with  those 
jurisdictions, while complying may lead to reputational risks. 

Deutsche Bank is committed to managing its business activities and operations in a sustainable manner, including aligning its 
portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050. In October, Deutsche Bank published its Initial Transition Plan (*), which documents 
the strategy that the bank has developed to decarbonize its operations, its upstream supply chain and its financing portfolio. 
In the plan the Group also disclosed net-zero aligned decarbonization pathways for three additional carbon intensive sectors 
compared to 2022, bringing the total number of sectors covered by portfolio targets to seven: Oil and Gas (upstream), Power 
Generation, Automotive (light duty vehicles), Steel, Coal mining, Cement and Shipping. Targets and metrics disclosed in the 
bank’s Transition Plan are integrated into the Group-wide risk management framework, appetite and controls.

The Group Sustainability Committee acts as the main governance and decision-making body for sustainability related matters 
across Deutsche  Bank.  This  includes  the  assessment  of  material  impacts as well  as  risks  and  opportunities for Deutsche 
Bank. The Management Board has delegated sustainability related decisions to this committee, which is chaired by the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Sustainability Officer (Vice Chair).  

The Group Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and established by the Management Board has the mandate to 
oversee  several  risk  &  capital  related  matters.  This  includes  the  responsibility  for  developing  the  bank’s  Climate  Risk 
Framework. The Committee approves the Bank’s climate and environmental risk appetite, including appetite for deviation from 
net-zero  decarbonization  linear  reduction  pathways.  A  number  of  other  committees  of  the  Group  Risk  Committee  are 
responsible for the development and management of specific elements of climate and environmental risk. 

Deutsche  Bank’s  business  activities  are  governed  by  a  dedicated  Climate  and  Environmental  Risk  Policy  outlining  roles, 
responsibilities as well as qualitative risk appetite principles and quantitative risk-appetite thresholds and KPIs. In addition, the 
bank’s Environmental  and Social  policy  outlines  specific  restrictions  for certain  sectors.  Deutsche  Bank  uses  a  number of 
complementary  tools  to  identify  and  assess  risks  including  the  Group’s  risk  identification  process,  an  internal  climate  risk 
taxonomy and regular internal reporting of portfolio financed emissions and intensities and progress against net zero targets.

Model Risk Management 

Model Risk Management  

Introduction 

Model  risk  is  the  potential  for  adverse  consequences  from  decisions  based  on  incorrect  estimation  approaches  (covering 
models and non-model estimates) or their misused outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business or strategic 
decision making, or damage to its reputation. Deutsche Bank recognizes the use of estimation approaches can affect other 
risk-types, and that model risk is a distinct risk that can increase or decrease aggregate risk across other risk-types. 

Deutsche Bank uses estimation approaches for a broad range of decision-making activities, such as: underwriting credits; 
valuing  exposures,  instruments,  and  positions;  measuring  risk;  managing  and  safeguarding  client  assets  and  determining 
capital and reserve adequacy. The term ‘estimation approach’ refers to a ‘model’ or ‘non-model estimate’ that is a quantitative 
or qualitative method, system, or approach that applies expert judgement, statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical 
theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates. Estimation approaches are simplified 
representations of real-world relationships and are based on assumptions and judgment. Accordingly, the Bank is exposed to 
model risk, which must be identified, measured, and controlled appropriately. 

Model risk management oversight is provided by all levels of management, including the Management Board. Management 
of model risk is underpinned by a framework designed and monitored by a 2nd Line of Defense control function independent 
from developer, owner, and user of estimation approaches.  

Model Risk Management Framework and Governance  

Model risk is one of the Bank’s Level 1 risks, and is overseen by the Chief Risk Officer through the setting of a quantitative 
and qualitative risk appetite statement, and managed through: 

–  The Model Risk Policy and Procedure, and supporting documents aligned to risk appetite, regulatory requirements, and 

industry best practice, with clear roles and responsibilities for stakeholders 

–  Inventorization  of  all  estimation  approaches,  supporting  ongoing  model  risk  framework  components  including  risk 

assessments and attestations 

–  Key  controls  for  estimation  approaches  from  development  through  to  decommissioning,  including  validation,  approval, 

deployment and monitoring 
–  Independent  Validations,  and  subsequent  independent  approvals,  verify  that  estimation  approaches  have  been 
appropriately designed and implemented for their intended scope and purpose, and that respective controls are in place 
to assure that they continue to perform as expected during their use 

–  The  controls  identify  estimation  approaches’  limitations  and  weaknesses,  resulting  in  findings  and  compensating 

controls, these may be conditions for use, such as adjustments or overlays 

–  Model risk governance, including senior forums for monitoring and escalation of model risk related topics, as well as monthly 
updates to the Management Board on the model risk appetite metrics, and periodic model risk updates to the Supervisory 
Board. 

Developments during the reporting period  

In 2023, Deutsche Bank elevated the status of model risk management with the Global Head of Model Risk Management 
joining the Executive Committee of the Chief Risk Officer and reporting directly into the CRO. This manifests the importance 
of model risk for the Bank and is reflective of model risk being a Level 1 risk for the Bank. 

In addition, Deutsche Bank consolidated the Model Inventory systems further on the strategic bank-wide model risk platform 
replacing  all  historic  inventories  going  forward.  This  single  platform  aligns  model  risk  data  across  the  Bank  and  supports 
compliance to the model risk framework, including key measurements, controls, and mitigation of model risks.

Risk and Capital Management 
Reputational Risk Management 

Reputational Risk Management 

Within the group’s risk management process, reputational risk is defined as the risk of possible damage to Deutsche Bank’s 
brand and reputation, and the associated risk to earnings, capital or liquidity arising from any association, action or inaction 
which could be perceived by stakeholders to be inappropriate, unethical or inconsistent with the Deutsche Bank’s values and 
beliefs.  

Deutsche Bank has limited appetite for transactions or relationships with material reputational risk or in areas which inherently 
pose  a  higher  reputational  risk  such  as  the  defense,  gaming,  or  adult  entertainment  sectors,  or  where  there  are  certain 
environmental concerns. Reputational risk cannot be precluded as it can be driven by unforeseeable changes in perception 
of its practices by its various stakeholders (e.g. public, clients, shareholders and regulators).  

The Reputational Risk Framework (the Framework) is in place to manage the process through which active decisions are 
taken on matters which may pose a reputational risk, before the event, and in doing so to prevent damage to Deutsche Bank’s 
reputation  wherever  possible.  The  Framework  provides  consistent  standards  for  the  identification,  assessment  and 
management of reputational risk issues. Reputational impacts which may arise as a consequence of a failure from another 
risk type, control or process are addressed separately via the associated risk type framework and are therefore not addressed 
in this section.  

The  reputational  risk  could  arise  from  multiple sources including, but not limited  to,  potential issues with  the profile  of  the 
counterparty, the business purpose / economic substance of the transaction or product, high risk industries, environmental 
and social considerations, and the nature of the transaction or product or its structure and terms.  

The modelling and quantitative measurement of reputational risk internal capital is implicitly covered in the bank’s economic 
capital framework primarily within strategic risk. 

Governance and Organizational Structure 

The Framework is applicable to all business units and regions. Matters specific to DWS are reviewed by a DWS reputational 
risk committee and, if necessary, escalated to the DWS Executive Board, which can escalate matters to the management 
board of Deutsche Bank AG. 

Whilst every employee has a responsibility to protect the bank’s reputation, the primary responsibility for the identification, 
assessment, management, monitoring and, if necessary, referring or reporting of reputational risk matters lies with Deutsche 
Bank’s Business Divisions as the primary risk owners. Each Business Division has an established process through which 
matters, which are deemed to be a moderate or greater reputational risk are assessed, the Unit Reputational Risk Assessment 
Process. 

The  Unit  RRAP  is  required  to  refer  any  material  reputational  risk  matters  to  the  respective  Regional  Reputational  Risk 
Committee. The Framework also sets out a number of matters which are considered inherently higher risk from a reputational 
risk  perspective  and  are  therefore  mandatory  referrals  to  the  Regional  Reputational  Risk  Committees.  The  Regional 
Reputational Risk Committees, which are 2nd LoD Committees, are responsible for ensuring the oversight, governance and 
coordination of the management of reputational risk in the respective region of Deutsche Bank. The Regional Reputational 
Risk Committees meet, as a minimum, on a quarterly basis with ad hoc meetings as required. The Group Reputational Risk 
Committee (GRRC) is responsible for ensuring the oversight, governance and coordination of the management of reputational 
risk  at  Deutsche  Bank  on  behalf  of  the  Group  Risk  Committee  and  the  Management  Board.  Additionally,  the  Group 
Reputational Risk Committee reviews cases with a Group wide impact and in exceptional circumstances, those that could not 
be resolved at a regional level.

Cybersecurity 

Cybersecurity 

Cybersecurity governance 

Responsibility for cybersecurity matters sits within the Chief Security Office, where it forms the first Line of Defense (1st LoD) 
within Deutsche Bank’s Three Lines of Defense (“3LoD”) model. The Chief Security Officer has delegated authority from the 
Management  Board  and  reports  directly  to  the  Chief  Technology,  Data,  and  Innovation  Officer,  who  is  a  member  of  the 
Management Board.  

Deutsche Bank’s Chief Security Officer has served in various roles in information security for more than 20 years. This includes 
the role as global Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) / Chief Security Officer (CSO) for three different large European 
financial institutions and a partner position in a global strategy and consulting firm, leading security work for financial service 
clients.  

The  Chief  Security  Officer  is  supported  by  information  security  role  holders  at  various  seniority  levels  to  help  ensure  that 
security  requirements  are  met  from  a  regional,  divisional,  and  technical  perspective.  All  information  security  activities  are 
overseen by two dedicated governance fora chaired by the Chief Security Officer: the Group IT Security Council (interface to 
the  bank’s  IT  units),  and  the  Group  Information  Security  Committee  (interface  to  the  bank’s  business  and  infrastructure 
divisions).  Furthermore,  both  fora  oversee  the  information  security  posture  of  Deutsche  Bank  against  defined  targets,  the 
progress and performance of key information security deliverables, the remediation status of information security related audit 
findings and current information security incidents. They also endorse the information security strategy and act as the highest 
escalation level within the Chief Security Office.  

The  Chief  Security  Office  develops  the  bank’s  group-wide  security  strategy  and  oversees  its  implementation  and 
operationalization globally via the organizational set-up, governance, and implemented security policies. The security strategy 
is  reviewed  continually  to  address  changes  in  the  threat  landscape,  technology,  the  regulatory  environment,  the  bank’s 
corporate and IT strategy, and other internal and external parameters. Deutsche Bank’s security strategy framework provides 
comprehensive and layered security controls. This framework is strengthened by a threat-driven approach to direct and adjust 
the security investment, including the continual review and assessment of the maturity of the bank’s security implementation.  

The Chief Security Office maintains a comprehensive metrics and reporting framework, underpinned by an extensive data set 
allowing for global, regional, and divisional views. Security metrics and reporting provided to the bank´s governance fora at all 
seniority  levels  support  appropriate  security  risk  awareness  and  decision  taking.  The  Management  Board  receives  a 
comprehensive quarterly information security risk posture report, as well as ad hoc information if required. Furthermore, the 
Chief Security Officer provides regular updates on material topics relating to security to the Supervisory Board’s Committee 
responsible for Technology, Data and Innovation. 

Information Security Risk is managed as an Operational Risk under the Non-Financial Risk Management Framework of the 
bank.  The  Chief  Security  Office,  in  its  responsibility  as  1st  LoD,  executes  against  the  Non-Financial  Risk  Management 
Framework and leverages its various instruments (e.g., an annual Risk & Control Assessment) whereas the Non-Financial 
Risk Management as second Line of Defense (2nd LoD) provides oversight, review, and challenge. Accordingly, part of the 
Non-Financial  Risk  Committee’s  (NFRC)  remit  is  to  oversee  and  govern  Deutsche  Bank’s  cybersecurity  risk  profile, 
remediation programs and risk tolerance. Also, 2nd LoD is represented in both 1st LoD fora described above. 

In alignment with its Non-Financial Risk Management policies, Deutsche Bank’s security policy framework defines the core 
principles of security risk management and the fundamentals for security management. The complete framework is reviewed 
annually, and any changes are endorsed by the Group Information Security Committee. The framework is governed centrally 
and  applied  globally  across  all  product  groups  and  business  and  infrastructure  divisions.  The  framework  includes  a  clear 
description of the risk tolerance related to information security. It also sets out the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities 
of key personnel identified to manage information security risk; the strategy and measures to cope with information security 
breaches, and related communication procedure.

Additionally, the bank’s Information Security Management System has been certified according to ISO 27001 for all information 
security  domains  defined  in  that  standard  since  2012.  To  maintain  the  ISO  27001  certification,  the  bank  performs  a  full 
recertification process every three years, with the latest taking place in 2021. In the years a full certification process does not 
take place, the bank performs a certification-follow-up, designed to ensure compliance between certification intervals. The 
latest certification follow-up was in 2023. The next full recertification will take place in September 2024. 

Deutsche Bank employs a variety of mechanisms to self-identify areas for improvements and control enhancements. These 
include  security  testing,  security  problem  management  and  lessons  learned.  The  effectiveness  of  the  bank´s  overall 
information security program is evaluated on a regular basis by third-party organizations that compare the bank’s approach 
with industry benchmarks. Deutsche Bank´s independent Group Audit function frequently includes the assessment of security 
controls in its audit plan.  

Identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity threats 

Deutsche Bank operates in an environment with increasing levels of digitization and a continually evolving landscape related 
to cybersecurity threats. Due to the dynamics and complexity of the current environment, the bank is continuously monitoring 
the  security  threat  landscape.  The  bank  vigilantly  observes  technological  developments,  the  geopolitical  landscape  and 
economic impacts driving security risks and assesses their relevance for potential impacts to Deutsche Bank and the wider 
financial ecosystem.  

Deutsche Bank has a variety of prevention methods and controls in place, such as threat intelligence, data leakage prevention, 
cyber  hygiene,  and  encryption  solutions.  These  also  include  placing  a  strong  emphasis  on  detection,  backed  by  a  robust 
incident-response  process.  The  bank  actively  shares  best  practices  and  threat  information  with  national  and  international 
security organizations, government authorities, and peer organizations. These relationships help to ensure that the bank’s 
security technology and procedures reflect current industry best practices and keep pace with the threat environment. 

Deutsche Bank’s security incident management covers cybersecurity events that may affect the bank, its clients, business 
partners, or employees. The related management and reporting processes performed with the involvement of Compliance, 
Legal and Group Data Privacy are designed to enable a quick and effective response to cyberattacks and information security 
threats. The objective is to minimize loss, leakage, or disruption and to use insights gained from the handling of incidents to 
continuously  improve  the  bank’s  processes.  The  worldwide  distributed  Cyber  Intelligence  and  Response  Centers  in  Asia-
Pacific, Europe and America allow detection of threats and response to incidents worldwide by 24/7 operations. 

To address evolving security threats, the bank continually reviews and enhances its information security controls into every 
layer  of  technology,  including  identity  and  access  management,  data,  infrastructure,  devices,  and  applications.  This  is 
complemented by organizational controls and security training and awareness. The purpose of this layered approach is to 
provide end-to-end protection, as well as multiple opportunities to detect, prevent, respond to, and recover from cyberthreats. 

Security risks are assessed on a regular basis, at least annually, taking internal as well as external risk drivers and events 
dynamically  into  account.  A  thorough  analysis  of  the  external  threat  landscape,  which  leverages  industry  standard  threat 
assessment frameworks, provides a foundation for the assessment of financial industry relevant risk scenarios. These are 
evaluated against the bank’s capabilities to cope with these risks. In case of emerging developments, additional risk reviews 
are conducted. As part of the annual risk and control assessment process, subject matter experts provide a risk description, 
and are supported by other areas such as Legal, Compliance or Group Data Privacy, as necessary. Senior information security 
experts from all divisions and functions assess the exposure of the Group, based on their divisional or functional background. 
The process considers contextual data such as major events, threat assessments, findings, scenario analysis, control metrics, 
lessons learned, read across, regulatory expectations and remediation activities when assessing control suites and residual 
risk positions. Measures for the further reduction of material residual risks may include policy changes or policy amendments 
at divisional or group level as well as prioritized investment and accelerated implementation of risk mitigating activities. 

Reliance on third parties’ products and services that support critical operations can affect the bank’s risk posture, because 
these can be the target of new and evolving cybersecurity attacks. This risk, along with expanded regulatory requirements, 
has necessitated an increased use of technology to better identify information security risks across third parties and where 
necessary, pro-actively perform outreach with them. Deutsche Bank manages third party information security risks by means 
of its global third-party risk management program. This program includes an information security policy specifically for third 
parties  that  sets  forth  the  bank’s  control  objectives  and  expectations.  Additionally,  Deutsche  Bank  has  a  third-party  risk 
management process designed to identify, monitor, and mitigate risks arising from working with third parties, which includes 
the bank’s oversight of third parties’ operations related to the services provided to the bank.

Cybersecurity 

Material and potentially material impacts from cybersecurity threats 

Deutsche Bank’s cybersecurity threats are mainly related to the risk of breaches in confidentiality, integrity, or availability of 
the banks or clients’ information, which includes breaches of the security of third-party computer systems. Breaches can occur 
due  to  unauthorized  access  to  networks  or  resources,  the  introduction  of  computer  viruses  or  malware,  or  other  forms  of 
cybersecurity attacks or incidents, including regulatory, geopolitical, operational, and third-party risk.  

Deutsche Bank may face operational risks arising from failures in the control environment, including errors in the performance 
of processes or security controls, as well as loss of data, which may disrupt business and lead to material losses. At the same 
time, the bank may also face risks of material losses or reputational damage, if services are not provided as agreed, or in line 
with internal standards, which could result in regulatory penalties and financial losses. Cyberattacks could impact Deutsche 
Bank both directly and indirectly including impacts from third parties.  

The  increasing  frequency  and  sophistication  of  recent  cyberattacks  has  resulted  in  an  elevated  risk  profile  for  many 
organizations around the world including Deutsche Bank. Significant attention by the bank’s management has been paid to 
the overall level of preparedness against such attacks. Cybersecurity continues as a focus area due to factors such as the 
continued and increasing reliance on the bank’s technology environment, as well as potential risks arising from the need for 
digital innovation, such as the usage of public cloud services, artificial intelligence, or quantum computing. 

The technological advancements also pose demands on data privacy, security, and other information security risks. As the 
use of artificial intelligence becomes widespread, there are also increased risks to cybersecurity: denial of service, the criminal 
use  of  deepfakes,  and  more  sophisticated  social  engineering  attacks.  Cybercrime  groups  may  have  the  capability  to  use 
machine learning techniques to automate the deployment and operation of malware campaigns.  

Financially  motivated  and  other  sophisticated  cyberattacks,  including  ransomware,  can  be  observed  as  persistent  threats 
across  industries  and  are  expected  to  become  more  frequent.  Additional  threats  are  posed  by  supply  chain  attacks,  an 
increasing  frequency  of  critical  software  vulnerabilities  potentially  exploited  by  threat  actors  (zero-day  exploits),  and  an 
expanding threat surface introduced by, for example, remote ways of working or the usage of cloud services.  

Deutsche  Bank  experienced  attacks  on  computer  systems,  including  attacks  aimed  at  obtaining  unauthorized  access  to 
confidential company or client information, damaging, or interfering with company data, resources, or business activities, or 
otherwise  exploiting  vulnerabilities  in  its  infrastructure,  including  attacks  that  occurred  at  the  bank’s  third-party  providers. 
In 2023, the bank did not experience any material effect on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition 
as a result of an information security incident, including an attempted cyberattack. Deutsche Bank expects to continue to be 
the target of such attacks in the future and may not be able to effectively anticipate or prevent more material attacks from 
occurring in the future. 

As a result, cyberattacks could lead to technology failures, security breaches, unauthorized access, unavailability of services, 
data loss, data destruction, and the inaccessibility of data and/or systems. This includes internal and third-parties information 
technology systems. A successful cyberattack could have a significant negative impact on the bank that may result in the 
disclosure  or  misuse  of  client  as  well  as  proprietary  information,  damage  to  or  inability  to  access  information  technology 
systems, financial losses, remediation costs (such as for investigation and reestablishing services), increased cybersecurity 
costs  (such  as  for  additional  personnel,  technology,  or  third-party  vendors),  personal  data  breach  notification  obligations, 
reputational damage, client dissatisfaction and potential regulatory penalties or litigation exposure.

Own Funds 

The  calculation  of  Deutsche  Bank’s  own  funds  incorporates  the  capital  requirements  following  the  “Regulation  (EU) 
No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions” CRR and the “Directive 2013/36/EU on access to the activity 
of  credit  institutions  and  the  prudential  supervision  of  credit  institutions”  “CRD”,  which  have  been  further  amended  with 
subsequent Regulations and Directives. The CRD has been implemented into German law. The information in this section as 
well as in the section “Development of risk-weighted assets” is based on the regulatory principles of consolidation. 

This section refers to the capital adequacy of the group of entities consolidated for banking regulatory purposes pursuant to 
the CRR and the German Banking Act (“Kreditwesengesetz” or “KWG”), which does not include insurance companies and 
companies outside the finance sector.  

The total own funds pursuant to the effective regulations as of year-end 2023 comprises Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital 
is subdivided into Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital. 

CET 1 capital consists primarily of common share capital (net of own holdings) including related share premium accounts, 
retained earnings (including losses for the financial year, if any) and accumulated other comprehensive income, subject to 
regulatory  adjustments  (i.e.,  prudential  filters  and  deductions),  as  well  as  minority  interests  qualifying  for  inclusion  in 
consolidated CET 1 capital. Prudential filters for CET 1 capital, according to Articles 32 to 35 CRR, include securitization gains 
on  sale,  cash  flow  hedges  and  changes  in  the  value  of  own  liabilities,  and  additional  value  adjustments.  CET 1  capital 
deductions for instance includes intangible assets (exceeding their prudential value), deferred tax assets that rely on future 
profitability, negative amounts resulting from the calculation of expected loss amounts, net defined benefit pension fund assets, 
(reciprocal cross holdings in the capital of financial sector entities and, significant and non-significant investments in the capital 
(CET 1, AT1, Tier 2) of financial sector entities above certain thresholds. All items which are not deducted (i.e., amounts below 
the threshold) are subject to risk-weighting.  

Additional Tier 1 capital consists of AT1 capital instruments and related share premium accounts as well as noncontrolling 
interests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated AT1 capital. To qualify as AT1 capital under CRR/CRD, instruments must 
have principal loss absorption through a conversion to common shares or a write-down mechanism allocating losses at a 
trigger point and must also meet further requirements such as perpetual with no incentive to redeem, institution must have full 
dividend/coupon discretion at all times, etc. 

Tier 2 capital comprises eligible capital instruments, the related share premium accounts and subordinated long-term debt, 
certain loan loss provisions and noncontrolling interests that qualify for inclusion in consolidated Tier 2 capital. To qualify as 
Tier 2 capital, capital instruments or subordinated debt must have an original maturity of at least five years. Moreover, eligible 
capital instruments may inter alia not contain an incentive to redeem, a right of investors to accelerate repayment, or a credit 
sensitive dividend feature. 

Capital instruments  

The Management Board was authorized by the 2022 Annual General Meeting to buy, on or before April 30, 2027, shares of 
up to 10% of the share capital at the time this resolution was taken or, if lower, of the share capital at the respective time the 
authorization was exercised. As at the 2022 Annual General Meeting, this corresponded to a volume of up to 206.6 million 
shares. Thereof, a volume of up to 5% of the total share capital or 103.3 million shares can be purchased by using derivatives, 
including derivatives with a volume of up to 2% of the total share capital with a maturity exceeding 18 months. During the 
period from the 2022 Annual General Meeting until the 2023 Annual General Meeting, 36.3 million shares were purchased for 
equity  compensation  purposes  in  the  same  period  or  upcoming  periods.  Thereof,  22.7 million  shares  were  purchased  by 
exercising  call  options.  In  addition,  30.2 million  new  call  options  were  purchased  for  equity  compensation  purposes  in 
upcoming periods. The number of shares held in Treasury amounted to 5.0 million as of the 2023 Annual General Meeting. 
These shares were held for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods.

The Annual General Meeting on May 17 , 2023 granted the Management Board the approval to buy, on or before April 30, 
2028, shares of up to 10% of the share capital at the time of this resolution was taken or, if lower, of the share capital at the 
respective time the authorization was exercised. As at the 2023 Annual General Meeting, this corresponded to 204 million 
shares. Thereof, a volume of up to 5% of the total share capital or 102 million shares can be purchased by using derivatives, 
including  derivatives  with  a  volume  of  up  to  2%  of  the  total  share  capital  with  a  maturity  exceeding  18  months.  These 
authorizations replaced the authorizations of the previous year. During the period from the 2023 Annual General Meeting until 
December 31,  2023,  45.5 million  shares  were  purchased  for  cancellation  with  the  purpose  of  distributing  capital  to 
shareholders.  The  number of  shares held  in  Treasury  from  buybacks  amounted  to  48.2 million  as  of  December 31, 2023. 
Thereof 45.5 million relate to shares bought back for cancellation. The remaining amount of 2.7 million shares relates to shares 
to be used for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods.  

Since  the  2017  Annual  General  Meeting,  renewed  at  the  2021  Annual  General  Meeting,  and  as  of  December  31,  2023, 
authorized capital available to the Management Board is € 2,560 million (1,000 million shares).  

Since the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the Management Board is authorized to issue participatory notes and other hybrid 
debt  securities  that  fulfill  the  regulatory  requirements  to  qualify  as  Additional  Tier 1  capital  with  an  equivalent  value  of 
€ 9.0 billion  on  or  before  April  30,  2027.  Deutsche  Bank  issued  € 1.25 billion  new  AT1  notes  under  this  authorization  in 
November 2022. 

The current CRR as applicable since June 27, 2019, provides further grandfathering rules for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments 
issued prior to June 27, 2019. AT1 and Tier 2 instruments issued through special purpose entities were grandfathered until 
December 31, 2021. In 2023, transitional arrangements only exist for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments which continue to qualify 
until June 26, 2025, even if they do not meet certain new requirements that apply since June 27, 2019. Deutsche Bank had 
an immaterial amount of instruments that qualified during 2023, which resulted in no material difference between the “fully 
loaded” and “transitional” amounts.  

Based on the current CRR, the Group has eligible AT1 instruments of € 8.6 billion outstanding as of December 2023. In 2023, 
the bank did not issue or redeem AT1 notes. 

As of December 31, 2023, Tier 2 capital instruments amounted to € 8.6 billion (nominal value of € 11.5 billion). In 2023, the 
bank issued Tier 2 capital instruments with a nominal value U.S. $ 1.5 billion (equivalent amount of € 1.4 billion) and a notional 
of € 132.5 million Tier 2 capital instruments matured. 

Minimum capital requirements and additional capital buffers 

The Pillar 1 CET 1 minimum capital requirement applicable to the Group is 4.50% of RWA. The Pillar 1 total capital requirement 
of 8.00% demands further resources that may be met with up to 1.50% Additional Tier 1 capital and up to 2.00% Tier 2 capital. 

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in supervisory measures such as restrictions of profit distributions or 
limitations on certain businesses such as lending. Deutsche Bank complied with the minimum regulatory capital adequacy 
requirements in 2023. 

In  addition  to  these  minimum  capital  requirements,  the  following  combined  capital  buffer requirements  were  fully  effective 
beginning 2023 onwards. These buffer requirements must be met in addition to the Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements but 
can be drawn down in times of economic stress. 

The capital conservation buffer is implemented in Section 10c German Banking Act, based on Article 129 CRD and equals a 
requirement of 2.50% CET 1 capital of RWA in 2023 and onwards. 

The countercyclical capital buffer is deployed in a jurisdiction when excess  credit growth is associated with an increase in 
system-wide risk. It may vary between 0% and 2.50% CET 1 capital of RWA. In exceptional cases, it could also be higher 
than  2.50%.  The  institution-specific  countercyclical  buffer  that  applies  to  Deutsche  Bank  is  the  weighted  average  of  the 
countercyclical capital buffers that apply in the jurisdictions where our relevant credit exposures are located. As per Decem-
ber 31, 2023, the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer was at 0.45%. 

In addition to the aforementioned buffers, national authorities, such as the BaFin, may require a systemic risk buffer to prevent 
and mitigate long-term non-cyclical systemic or macro-prudential risks that are not covered by the CRR. They can require an 
additional buffer of up to 5.00% CET 1 capital of RWA. As of the year end 2023, a systemic risk buffer applied to Deutsche 
Bank is 0.19%.

Deutsche Bank continues to be designated as a global systemically important institution (G-SII) by the BaFin in agreement 
with the Deutsche Bundesbank, resulting in a G-SII buffer requirement of 1.50% CET 1 capital of RWA in 2023 based on the 
indicators as published in 2020. This assessment has been confirmed by the FSB in 2023. Further, BaFin has announced that 
the G-SII buffer requirement for Deutsche Bank will remain unchanged for the years 2024 and 2025  

Additionally,  Deutsche  Bank  has  been  classified  by  BaFin  in  agreement  with  the  Deutsche  Bundesbank  as  an  “other 
systemically important institution” (O-SII) with an additional capital buffer requirement of 2.00% in 2023 that has to be met on 
a consolidated level. Hence, for Deutsche Bank, the O-SII buffer amounts to  2.00% in 2023. BaFin has announced O-SII 
buffer requirement for Deutsche bank remain unchanged for the year 2024.The higher of the buffers for systemically important 
institutions (G-SII buffer or O-SII buffer) must be applied.  

Pursuant to the Pillar 2 SREP, the ECB may impose capital requirements on individual banks which are more stringent than 
statutory requirements (so-called Pillar 2 requirement).  

In  December  2022,  the  ECB  informed  Deutsche  Bank  of  its  decision  effective  January  1,  2023,  that  the  bank’s  Pillar 2 
requirement changed compared to 2022. This results in ECB’s Pillar 2 requirement to 2.70% of RWA. As of  December 31, 
2023, Deutsche Bank needs to maintain on a consolidated basis a CET 1 ratio of at least 11.16%, a Tier 1 ratio of at least 
13.17%  and  a  Total  Capital  ratio  of  at  least  15.84%.  The  CET  1  requirement  comprises  the  Pillar  1  minimum  capital 
requirement  of  4.50%,  the  Pillar  2  requirement  (SREP  add-on)  of  1.52%,  the  capital  conservation  buffer  of  2.50%,  the 
countercyclical buffer of 0.45% and the systemic risk buffer of 0.19% (both subject to changes throughout the year) as well as 
the higher of our G-SII/O-SII buffer of 2.00%. Correspondingly, the Tier 1 capital requirement includes additionally a Tier 1 
minimum capital requirement of 1.50% plus a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.51%, and the Total Capital requirement includes further 
a Tier 2 minimum capital requirement of 2.00% and a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.68%. Also, following the results of the 2023 
SREP, the ECB communicated to Deutsche Bank an individual expectation to hold a further Pillar 2 CET 1 capital add-on, 
commonly referred to as the Pillar 2 guidance. The capital add-on pursuant to the Pillar 2 guidance is separate from and in 
addition to the Pillar 2 requirement. The ECB has stated that it expects banks to meet the Pillar 2 guidance although it is not 
legally binding, and failure to meet the Pillar 2 guidance does not lead to automatic restrictions of capital distributions.  

On  December  11,  2023,  Deutsche  Bank  was  informed  by  the  ECB  of  its  decision  regarding  prudential  minimum  capital 
requirements for 2024 that applies from January 1, 2024, onwards, following the results of the 2023 SREP. The decision set 
ECB’s Pillar 2 requirement to 2.65% of RWA, effective as of January 1, 2024, of which at least 1.49% must be covered by 
CET 1 capital and 1.99% by Tier 1 capital.  

The following table gives an overview of the different Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 minimum capital buffer requirements (but excluding 
the Pillar 2 guidance) as applicable to Deutsche Bank for the years 2023 and 2024.

Development of Own Funds 

Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 capital as of December 31, 2023, amounted to € 48.1 billion and remained materially flat compared 
to  the  end  of  2022.  AT1  capital  was  € 0.2 billion  lower  amounted  to  € 8.3 billion  as  of  December  31,  2023  compared  to 
€ 8.5 billion at the end of 2022. Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2023, amounted to € 56.4 billion compared to € 56.6 billion 
at the end of 2022. Tier 2 capital was  € 0.9 billion lower as of December 31, 2023, amounted to  € 8.6 billion compared to 
€ 9.5 billion  at  the  end  of  2022.  Total  capital  was  € 1.1 billion  lower  as  of  December  31,  2023,  amounted  to  € 65.0 billion 
compared to € 66.1 billion at the end of 2022. 

CET 1 capital was materially flat over the year with positive net profit of  € 4.8 billion for the year 2023 offset by regulatory 
deductions for future common share dividend and AT1 coupon payments of € 1.3 billion which is in line with the ECB Decision 
(EU)  (2015/656)  on  the  recognition  of  interim  or  year-end  profits  in  CET  1  capital  in  accordance  with  the  Article  26(2)  of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (ECB/2015/4), and increased regulatory adjustments related to the expected loss shortfall of 
€ 1.9 billion mainly due to new model implementations and deferred tax assets of € 1.0 billion partially offset by reductions in 
the  additional  value  adjustment  of  € 0.3 billion,  equity  compensation  of  € 0.2 billion  and  other  regulatory  adjustments  of 
€ 0.1 billion. In addition, CET 1 capital decreased as a result of negative effects from currency translation adjustments net of 
capital deduction item counter-effects of € 0.8 billion and share buybacks of € 0.5 billion. 

The AT1 capital decrease of  € 0.2 billion was driven by increased capital deduction resulting from higher limits for market 
making transactions.  

The Tier 2 capital decrease of € 0.9 billion was mainly due to the redemption of a Tier 2 instrument with a notional amount of 
€ 1.3 billion, € 0.7 billion amortization, € 0.2 billion due to foreign exchange effects and € 0.2 billion higher deduction in market 
making limit. This was partially offset by issuance of a new Tier 2 capital instrument with a notional amount of € 1.4 billion in 
the first quarter of 2023.

Minimum loss coverage for Non Performing Exposure (NPE)  

In April 2019, the EU published requirements Regulation (EU) 2019/630 amending the CRR (Regulation (EU) No 575/2013) 
for a prudential backstop reserve for non-performing exposure (NPE). This regulation results in a Pillar 1 deduction from CET 1 
capital  when  a  minimum  loss  coverage  requirement  is  not  met.  It  is  applied  to  exposures  originated  and  defaulted  after 
April 25, 2019.  

In  addition,  in  March  2018,  the  ECB  published  its  “Addendum  to  the  ECB  Guidance  to  banks  on  non-performing  loans: 
supervisory expectations for prudential provisioning of non-performing exposures” and in August 2019, its “Communication 
on supervisory coverage expectations for NPEs”.  

The ECB guidance issued is applicable to all newly defaulted loans after April 1, 2018 (ECB - new NPE’s after April 1, 2018) 
and, similar to the EU rules, it requires banks to take measures in case a minimum impairment coverage requirement is not 
met. Within the annual SREP discussions ECB may impose Pillar 2 measures on banks in case ECB is not confident with 
measure taken by the individual bank. 

For the year end 2020, the bank introduced a framework to determine the prudential provisioning of non-performing exposure 
as a Pillar 2 measure as requested in the before mentioned ECB’s guidance and SREP recommendation.  

For the minimum loss coverage expectation for NPE´s arising from clients defaulted before April 1, 2018 (ECB – NPE Stock) 
a phase-in path to 100% coverage expectation was envisaged with an annual increase of 10%. In a first step, banks were 
allocated  to  three  comparable  groups  on  the  basis  of  the  bank’s  net NPL  ratios  as  of  end-2017  and  in  a  second  step  an 
assessment of capacity regarding the potential impact was carried out for each individual bank with a horizon of end-2026. 
Deutsche Bank has been assigned to Group 1 which requires a full applicability of 100% minimum loss coverage by year end 
2024 for secured loans respectively by year end 2023 for unsecured loans. 

The shortfall between the minimum loss coverage requirements for non-performing exposure and the risk reserves recorded 
in line with the IFRS 9 for defaulted (Stage 3) assets amounted to € 322 million as of December 31, 2023 and was deducted 
from CET 1. This additional CET 1 charge can be considered as additional loss reserve and leads to a € 2.6 billion RWA relief. 
The reduction in the shortfall and the respective increase in the RWA relief in 2023 were driven by the benefits from data and 
process optimization as part of the bank´s capital efficiency measures, as discussed below.

Deutsche Bank´s RWA were € 349.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared to € 360.0 billion at the end of 2022. Market 
risk RWA declined by € 4.6 billion, primarily driven by decreases in the Value-at-Risk and Stressed-Value-at-Risk components 
following a reduction in the qualitative and quantitative components of the capital multiplier. In addition, reductions in exposure 
led to a lower Value-at-Risk and Stressed-Value-at-Risk, which was partially offset by a higher Incremental Risk Charge, when 
compared to year end 2022. Credit risk RWA decreased by € 3.4 billion, primarily driven by benefits from data and process 
optimization  as  part  of  the  bank´s  capital  efficiency  measures,  new  securitizations,  foreign  exchange  movements  and  a 
reduction in RWA for deferred tax assets. This was partially offset by an RWA increase due to regulatory changes from the 
introduction of new models, impacts from rating migration, exposures to central counterparties, increases from the acquisition 
of  Numis  and  business  growth.  Operational  risk  RWA  decreased  by  € 1.2 billion,  mainly  driven  by  a  more  favorable 
development of Deutsche Bank´s internal loss profile feeding into the capital model. Credit valuation adjustment (CVA) RWA 
decreased  by  € 0.9 billion  mainly  driven  by  model  updates  and  market  data  changes,  partially  offset  by  changes  in 
methodology and policy as well as business activities. 

The tables below provide an analysis of key drivers for risk-weighted asset movements observed for credit risk, credit valuation 
adjustments as well as market and operational risk in the reporting period. They also show the corresponding movements in 
capital requirements, derived from the RWA by an 8% minimum capital requirement.

The classifications of key drivers for the RWA credit risk development table are fully aligned with the recommendations of the 
Enhanced  Disclosure  Task  Force.  Organic  changes  in  the  Group´s  portfolio  size  and  composition  are  considered  in  the 
category “book size”. The category “book quality” mainly represents the effects from portfolio rating migrations, loss given 
default, model parameter recalibrations as well as collateral and netting coverage activities. “Model updates” include model 
refinements and advanced model roll out. RWA movements resulting from externally, regulatory-driven changes, e.g., applying 
new  regulations,  are  considered  in  the  “methodology  and  policy”  section.  “Acquisition  and  disposals”  is  reserved  to  show 
significant exposure movements which can be clearly assigned to new businesses or disposal-related activities. Changes that 
cannot be attributed to the above categories are reflected in the category “other”. 

The decrease in RWA for credit risk by € 3.4 billion, or 1.3%, since December 31, 2022, is mainly driven by the categories 
“foreign  exchange  movements”,  “book size”,  “other”  and  “book quality”.  This was  partially  offset  by  changes  shown  in  the 
categories “methodology and policy”, “acquisition and disposals” and “model updates”. The decrease in category “book size” 
is  predominantly  driven  by  a  relief  from  synthetic  securitizations  in  the  Corporate  Bank  and  the  Private  Bank,  which  was 
partially offset by business growth. Additionally, the decrease in category “other” reflects a reduction in RWA for deferred tax 
assets and investments in financial sector entities. The reduction in “book quality” is mainly driven by benefits from data and 
process optimization as part of the bank´s capital efficiency measures, partially offset by counterparty rating deteriorations. 
The  aforementioned  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  increases  in  the  category  “methodology  and  policy”  which  mainly 
reflects impacts from the introduction of new models due to regulatory changes and exposures to central counterparties. The 
category “acquisition and disposals” reflects the acquisition of Numis. Furthermore, credit risk RWA increased in the category 
“model updates” compared to 2022, driven by refinements on Deutsche Bank´s IRBA model.  

RWA for counterparty credit risk decreased by € 3.7 billion, or 15.8%, since December 31, 2022, mainly driven by the decrease 
in category “book size” reflecting lower exposures for derivatives along with lower risk weights for new positions as well as a 
reduction in the category “foreign exchange movements”. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in category “book 
quality”, particularly stemming from counterparty rating deteriorations. Additionally, RWA for counterparty credit risk increased 
in the category “methodology and policy”, driven by impacts from the introduction of new models due to regulatory changes 
and exposures to central counterparties. 

Based on the CRR/CRD regulatory framework, Deutsche Bank is required to calculate RWA using the CVA which takes into 
account  the  credit  quality  of  our  counterparties.  RWA  for  CVA  covers  the  risk  of  mark-to-market  losses  on  the  expected 
counterparty risk in connection with OTC derivative exposures and securities financing transactions. Deutsche Bank calculates 
the majority of the CVA based on our own internal model as approved by the BaFin.

The development of CVA RWA is broken down into a number of categories: “Movement in risk levels”, which includes changes 
to the portfolio size and composition; “Market data changes and calibrations”, which includes changes in market data levels 
and volatilities as well as recalibrations; “Model updates”, which refers to changes to either the IMM credit exposure models 
or the value-at-risk models that are used for CVA RWA; “Methodology and policy”, which relates to changes to the regulation. 
Any significant business acquisitions or disposals would be presented in the category “Acquisitions and disposals”.

The analysis for market risk covers movements in the bank’s internal models for value-at-risk (VaR), stressed value-at-risk, 
incremental risk charge (IRC) as well as results from the market risk standardized approach (MRSA), which is captured in the 
category  “Other”.  MRSA  is  used  to  determine  the  regulatory  capital  charge  for  the  specific  market  risk  of  trading  book 
securitizations, for certain types of investment funds and for longevity risk as set out in CRR/CRD regulations.  

Market risk RWA movements due to changes in market data levels, volatilities, correlations, liquidity and ratings are included 
under  the  “Market  data  changes  and  recalibrations”  category.  Changes  to  market  risk  RWA  internal  models,  such  as 
methodology enhancements or risk scope extensions, are included in the category “Model updates”. In the “Methodology and 
policy”  category  regulatory  driven  changes  to  market  risk  RWA  models  and  calculations  are  reported.  Significant  new 
businesses and disposals would be assigned to the line item “Acquisition and disposals”. The impacts of “Foreign exchange 
movements” are only calculated for the CRM and Standardized approach methods. 

As of December 31, 2023 the RWA for market risk was € 21.5 billion, a decrease of € 4.6 billion, or -18% since December 31, 
2022. The decrease is driven by the “Methodology and policy” category due to a reduction in quantitative component of capital 
multiplier by 0.85 on the back of backtesting outliers moving out of the 250 day window and reduction in qualitative component 
of multiplier by 0.5. The Incremental Risk Charge increased by € 3.5 billion driven by changes in sovereign bond inventory for 
facilitating market making in Global Rates and Global Emerging Markets business which is offset by lower value at risk and 
stressed value at risk driven by a reduction in interest rates exposure under Global Rates and reductions following the changes 
in Global Foreign Exchange business strategy.

Changes in internal and external loss events are reflected in the category “Loss profile changes”. The category “Expected loss 
development” is based on divisional business plans as well as historical losses and is deducted from the AMA capital figure 
within certain constraints. The category “Forward looking risk component” reflects qualitative adjustments and, as such, the 
effectiveness  and  performance  of  the  day-to-day  operational  risk  management  activities  via  Non-Financial  Risk  appetite 
metrics and Risk and Control Assessment (RCA) scores, focusing on the business environment and internal control factors. 
The  category  “Model  updates”  covers  model  refinements,  such  as  the  implementation  of  model  changes.  The  category 
“Methodology and policy” represents externally driven changes such as regulatory add-ons. The category “Acquisition and 
disposals” represents significant exposure movements which can be clearly assigned to new or disposed businesses. 

The overall decrease of the RWA for operational risk by € 1.2 billion during 2023 was mainly driven by lower loss frequencies 
feeding into our capital model. 

Economic Capital 

Economic capital adequacy 

Deutsche Bank’s internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) aims at maintaining the continuity of the bank on an 
ongoing basis. Internal capital adequacy is assessed from an economic perspective as the ratio of economic capital supply 
divided by economic capital demand as shown in the table below.

The economic capital adequacy ratio was 205% as of December 31, 2023, compared with 239% as of December 31, 2022. 
The  decline  was  due  to  an  increase  in  economic  capital  demand,  which  is  explained  in  the  section  “Risk  Profile”,  and  a 
decrease in economic capital supply.  

The  decrease  in  economic  capital  supply  by  € 2.4 billion  compared  to  year-end  2022  was  mainly  driven  by  higher  capital 
deduction from expected loss shortfall of € 1.9 billion, introduction of a new deduction of € 1.5 billion for valuation differences 
between carrying and fair values for debt securities held to collect, deductions for future common share dividend and AT1 
coupon payments of € 1.3 billion, currency translation adjustments of € 1.1 billion, higher capital deductions for IFRS deferred 
tax assets excluding temporary differences of € 0.8 billion and cash flow hedges of € 0.8 billion. These decreases were partly 
offset by a positive net income of € 4.8 billion and reduced deduction for additional valuation adjustments of € 0.3 billion.

Leverage Ratio 

Leverage Ratio according to CRR/CRD framework 

The non-risk-based leverage ratio is intended to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-based capital requirements. Its 
objectives are to constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, helping avoid destabilizing deleveraging processes 
which can damage the broader financial system and the economy, and to reinforce the risk-based requirements with a simple, 
non-risk based “backstop” measure. 

A minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3% was introduced effective starting with June 28, 2021. Starting January 1, 2023, 
an additional leverage ratio buffer requirement of 50% of the applicable G-SII buffer rate applies. This additional requirement 
equals 0.75% for Deutsche Bank. Furthermore, the European Central Bank has set a Pillar 2 requirement for the leverage 
ratio for the first time; effective January 1, 2024, this requirement will be 0.10%. 

Deutsche Bank calculates its leverage ratio exposure in accordance with Articles 429 to 429g of the CRR. 

The Group’s  total  leverage ratio  exposure includes derivatives,  securities  financing transactions  (SFTs),  off-balance  sheet 
exposure and other on-balance sheet exposure (excluding derivatives and SFTs). 

The leverage exposure for derivatives is calculated by using a modified version of the standardized approach for counterparty 
credit  risk  (SA-CCR),  comprising  the  current  replacement  cost  plus  a  regulatory  defined  add-on  for  the  potential  future 
exposure.  The  effective  notional  amount  of  written  credit  derivatives,  i.e.,  the  notional  reduced  by  any  negative  fair  value 
changes  that  have  been  incorporated  in  Tier  1  capital  is  included  in  the  leverage  ratio  exposure  measure;  the  resulting 
exposure measure is further reduced by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivative protection on the same 
reference name provided certain conditions are met. 

The SFT component includes the gross receivables for SFTs, which are netted with SFT payables if specific conditions are 
met. In addition to the gross exposure a regulatory add-on for the counterparty credit risk is included.  

The off-balance sheet exposure component follows the standardized approach for credit risk with credit risk conversion factors 
(CCF) depending on the risk category (0% for low risk, 20% for medium/low risk, 50% for medium risk, or 100% for full risk). 
For the determination of the leverage exposure a floor of 10% is applied leading to a 10% CCF for the low risk category. 

The on-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives and SFTs) component reflects the accounting values of the assets 
(excluding derivatives, SFTs and regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement). The exposure value of regular-way 
purchases and sales awaiting settlement is determined as offset between those cash receivables and cash payables where 
the related regular-way sales and purchases are both settled on a delivery-versus payment basis. 

Assets can be excluded from the leverage ratio exposure measure if they have been deducted in the determination of Tier 1 
capital. The corresponding regulatory adjustments are reflected in the asset amounts deducted in determining Tier 1 capital 
component. 

The following tables show the leverage ratio exposure and the leverage ratio. For further details on Tier 1 capital please also 
refer to the section “Development of Own Funds”.

Description of the factors that had an impact on the leverage ratio in 2023 

As of December 31, 2023, the leverage ratio was 4.5% compared to 4.6% as of December 31, 2022. This takes into account 
a  Tier 1  capital  of  € 56.4 billion  over  an  applicable  exposure  measure  of  € 1,240.3 billion  as  of  December 31,  2023 
(€ 56.6 billion over an applicable exposure measure of € 1,240.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, respectively). 

Over  the  year  2023  the  leverage  exposure  was  materially  unchanged  at  € 1,240.3 billion.  Asset  amounts  deducted  in 
determining Tier 1 capital declined by € 2.8 billion mainly reflecting higher capital deductions for negative amounts resulting 
from  the  calculation  of  expected  loss  amounts  and  deferred  tax  assets.  In  addition,  off-balance  sheet  leverage  exposure 
decreased by € 0.6 billion. The leverage exposure for assets not related to derivatives and secured financing transactions 
decreased by € 0.5 billion which largely reflects the development of the balance sheet (for additional information please refer 
to  section  “Movements  in  assets  and  liabilities”  in  this  report).  SFT-related  items  (securities  purchased  under  resale 
agreements and securities borrowed) increased by € 3.0 billion, largely in line with the development on the balance sheet. 
Furthermore, the leverage exposure related to derivatives increased by € 0.8 billion. 

The development of the leverage exposure in 2023 includes a negative foreign exchange impact of € 17.7 billion mainly due 
to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro. The effects from foreign exchange rate movements are embedded in the 
movement of the leverage exposure items discussed in this section. 

For main drivers of the Tier 1 capital development please refer to section “Development of Own Funds”. 

Minimum Requirement of Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities and Total Loss 
Absorbing Capacity 

MREL Requirements 

The minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) was introduced by the European Union’s Regulation 
establishing  uniform  rules  and  a  uniform  procedure  for  the  resolution  of  credit  institutions  (Single  Resolution  Mechanism 
Regulation or SRMR) and the European Union’s Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit 
institutions (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive or BRRD) as implemented into German law by the German Recovery 
and Resolution Act.  

The  currently  required  level  of  MREL  is  determined  by  the  competent  resolution  authorities  for  each  supervised  bank 
individually, depending on the respective preferred resolution strategy. In the case of Deutsche Bank AG, MREL is determined 
by  the  Single  Resolution  Board.  While  there  is  no  statutory  minimum  level  of  MREL,  the  SRMR,  BRRD  and  a  delegated 
regulation set out criteria which the resolution authority must consider when determining the relevant required level of MREL. 
Guidance is provided through an MREL policy published annually by the SRB. Any binding MREL ratio determined by the 
SRB is communicated to Deutsche Bank via the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).  

As a result of its regular annual review the SRB has updated Deutsche Bank AG’s binding MREL ratio requirements in the 
second quarter of 2023 applicable immediately. The MREL ratio requirement on a consolidated basis is now 25.21% of RWA 
and 6.92% of LRE of which 19.54% of RWA and 6.92% of LRE must be met with own funds and subordinated instruments.  

The combined buffer requirements of 5.14% as of December 31, 2023 must be met in addition to the RWA based MREL and 
subordinated MREL requirements.

TLAC Requirements 

Since June 27, 2019, Deutsche Bank, as a global systemically important bank, has also become subject to global minimum 
standards for its Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). The TLAC requirement was implemented via amendments to the 
Capital  Requirements  Regulation  and  the  Capital  Requirements  Directive  provided  in  June  2019  with  the  publication  of 
Regulation (EU) 2019/876 and Directive (EU) 2019/878.  

This TLAC requirement is based on both risk-based and non-risk-based denominators and set at the higher-of 18% of RWA 
plus the combined buffer requirements and 6.75% of LRE since January 1, 2022. 

MREL ratio development 

As of December 31, 2023, available MREL were € 123.3 billion, corresponding to a ratio of 35.24% of RWA. This means that 
Deutsche Bank has a comfortable MREL surplus of € 17.1 billion above Deutsche Bank’s MREL requirement of € 106.2 billion 
(i.e. 30.35% of RWA including combined buffer requirement). Compared to December 31, 2022 the surplus has reduced as a 
higher MREL requirement was not fully offset by lower RWA.  

€ 114.1 billion of Deutsche Bank’s available MREL were own funds and subordinated liabilities, corresponding to a MREL 
subordination  ratio  of  32.63%  of  RWA,  a  buffer  of  € 27.8 billion  over  Deutsche  Bank’s  subordination  requirement  of 
€ 86.3 billion (i.e. 24.68% of RWA including combined buffer requirements). Compared to December 31, 2022 the surplus has 
increased due to a lower subordinated MREL requirement and lower RWA. 

TLAC ratio development 

As of December 31, 2023, TLAC was € 114.1 billion and the corresponding TLAC ratios were 32.63% of RWA and 9.20% of 
LRE.  This  means  that  Deutsche  Bank  has  a  comfortable  TLAC  surplus  of  € 30.4 billion  over  its  TLAC  requirement  of 
€ 83.7 billion (6.75% of LRE). Compared to December 31, 2022 the surplus has reduced due to a lower available TLAC.

Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities 

To meet the MREL and TLAC requirement, Deutsche Bank needs to ensure that enough eligible liabilities instruments are 
maintained. Instruments eligible for MREL and TLAC are regulatory capital instruments (own funds) and liabilities that meet 
certain criteria, which are referred to as eligible liabilities.  

Own funds used for MREL and TLAC include the full amount of Tier 2 capital instruments with a remaining maturity of greater 
than 1 year and less than 5 years which are reflected in regulatory capital on a pro-rata basis only.  

Eligible  liabilities  are liabilities  issued  out of  the  resolution  entity  Deutsche Bank  AG that  meet  eligibility  criteria  which  are 
supposed to ensure that they are structurally suited as loss-absorbing capital. As a result, eligible liabilities exclude deposits 
which are covered by an insurance deposit protection scheme or which are preferred under German insolvency law (e.g., 
deposits from private individuals as well as small and medium-sized enterprises). Among other things, secured liabilities and 
derivatives  liabilities  are generally  excluded  as  well.  Debt instruments  with  embedded  derivative  features  can  be  included 
under certain conditions (e.g., a known and fixed or increasing principal). In addition, eligible liabilities must have a remaining 
time to maturity of at least one year and must either be issued under the law of a Member State of the European Union or 
must include a bail-in clause in their contractual terms to make write-down or conversion effective. The SRB has granted a 
transitional period for liabilities issued under UK law on or before November 15, 2018, which do not include an enforceable 
and effective bail-in clause but can still be included in eligible liabilities after Brexit until June 28, 2025. 

In addition, eligible liabilities need to be subordinated to be counted against the TLAC and MREL subordination requirements. 
Effective January 1, 2017, the German Banking Act provided for a new class of statutorily subordinated debt securities that 
rank as senior non-preferred below the bank’s other senior liabilities (but in priority to the bank’s contractually subordinated 
liabilities, such as those qualifying as Tier 2 instruments). Following a harmonization effort by the European Union implemented 
in Germany effective July 21, 2018, banks are permitted to now decide if a specific issuance of eligible senior debt will be in 
the non-preferred or in the preferred category. Any such senior non-preferred debt instruments issued by Deutsche Bank AG 
under such rules rank on parity with its outstanding debt instruments that were classified as senior non-preferred under the 
prior rules. All these senior non-preferred issuances meet the TLAC and MREL subordination criteria.

Credit Risk Exposure 

Credit Risk Exposure 

Deutsche Bank defines its credit exposure by taking into account all transactions where losses might occur due to the fact 
that counterparties may not fulfill their contractual payment obligations as defined under ‘Credit Risk Framework’. 

Maximum Exposure to Credit Risk 

The maximum exposure to credit risk table shows the direct exposure before consideration of associated collateral held and 
other  credit  enhancements  (netting  and  hedges)  that  do  not  qualify  for  offset  in  the  financial  statements  for  the  periods 
specified. The netting credit enhancement component includes the effects of legally enforceable netting agreements as well 
as the offset of negative mark-to-markets from derivatives against pledged cash collateral. The collateral credit enhancement 
component  mainly  includes  real  estate,  collateral  in  the  form  of  cash  as  well  as  securities-related  collateral.  In  relation  to 
collateral,  the  Group  applies  internally  determined  haircuts  and  additionally  cap  all  collateral  values  at  the  level  of  the 
respective collateralized exposure.

The overall decrease in maximum exposure to credit risk for December 31, 2023 was € 34.3 billion mainly driven by decreases 
of € 47.8 billion in positive market values from derivatives financial instruments, € 15.7 billion in other assets subject to credit 
risk  and  € 9.6 billion  in  loans  at  amortized  cost.  These  decreases  were  partly  offset  by  increases  in  trading  assets  of 
€ 32.6 billion, € 3.9 billion in financial assets at fair value through OCI and € 2.3 billion in Off-balance sheet exposure. 

Trading assets as of December 31, 2023, includes traded bonds of € 112.5 billion (€ 80.2 billion as of December 31, 2022) of 
which over 85% were investment-grade (over 83% as of December 31, 2022). 

Credit Enhancements are split into three categories: netting, collateral and guarantees / credit derivatives. Haircuts, parameter 
setting  for  regular  margin  calls  as  well  as  expert  judgments  for  collateral  valuation  are  employed  to  prevent  market 
developments from leading to a build-up of uncollateralized exposures. All categories are monitored and reviewed regularly. 
Overall credit enhancements received are diversified and of adequate quality being largely cash, highly rated government 
bonds  and  third-party  guarantees  mostly  from  well  rated  banks  and  insurance  companies.  These  financial  institutions  are 
domiciled mainly in European countries and the United States. Furthermore, the Bank has  collateral pools of highly liquid 
assets and mortgages (principally consisting of residential properties mainly in Germany) for the homogeneous retail portfolio.

Credit Risk Exposure 

Main Credit Exposure Categories  

The tables in this section show details about several of Deutsche Bank’s main credit exposure categories, namely Loans, 
Revocable  and  Irrevocable  Lending  Commitments,  Contingent  Liabilities,  Over-The-Counter  (“OTC”)  Derivatives,  Debt 
Securities and Repo and repo-style transactions: 

–  “Loans” are gross loans as reported on our balance sheet at amortized cost, loans at fair value through profit and loss and 
loans  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  before  deduction  of  allowance  for  credit  losses;  this  includes 
“Traded loans” that are bought and held for the purpose of selling them in the near term, or the material risks of which have 
all been hedged or sold; from a regulatory perspective the latter category principally covers trading book positions 

–  “Revocable and irrevocable lending commitments” consist of the undrawn portion of revocable and irrevocable lending-

related commitments 

–  “Contingent  liabilities”  consist  of  financial  and  performance  guarantees,  standby  letters  of  credit  and  other  similar 

arrangements (mainly indemnity agreements) 

–  “OTC derivatives” are the bank’s credit exposures from over-the-counter derivative transactions that the Group has entered 
into, after netting and cash collateral received; on the bank’s balance sheet, these are included in financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss or, for derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting, in other assets, in either case only applying 
cash collateral received and netting eligible under IFRS 

–  “Debt securities” include debentures, bonds, deposits, notes or commercial paper, which are issued for a fixed term and 
redeemable by the issuer, as reported on our balance sheet within accounting categories at amortized cost and at fair value 
through other comprehensive income before deduction of allowance for credit losses, it also includes category at fair value 
through profit and loss; this includes “Traded bonds”, which are bonds, deposits, notes or commercial paper that are bought 
and held for the purpose of selling them in the near term; from a regulatory perspective the latter category principally covers 
trading book positions 

–  “Repo  and  repo-style  transactions”  consist  of  reverse  repurchase  transactions,  as  well  as  securities  or  commodities 

borrowing transactions, only applying collateral received and netting eligible under IFRS. 

Although considered in the monitoring of maximum credit exposures, the following are not included in the details of the Group’s 
main  credit  exposure:  brokerage  and  securities  related  receivables,  cash  and  central  bank  balances,  interbank  balances 
(without central banks), assets held for sale, accrued interest receivables, traditional securitization positions. 

Unless stated otherwise, the tables below reflect credit exposure before the consideration of collateral and risk mitigation or 
structural enhancements, except for OTC derivatives wherein they are post credit enhancements

business 

Deutsche  Bank’s  total  main  credit  exposure  increased  by  € 19.8 billion  year-on-year  where  € 32 billion  of  an  increase  in 
Investment Bank, is partially offset by decrease in the Private Bank by  € 7.7 billion, Corporate Bank by € 3.2 billion and in 
Corporate & Other by € 2.3 billion. The business division Corporate & Other primarily contains exposures in Treasury and 
Capital Release Unit. Exposure increases have been observed primarily in Debt Securities and Off-Balance sheet which is 
partly offset by decrease in Loans and OTC Derivative products included in main credit exposures by business divisions. 

Main Credit Exposure Categories by Industry Sectors  

The below tables give an overview of the bank’s credit exposure by industry based on the NACE code of the counterparty. 
NACE  (Nomenclature  des  Activités  Économiques  dans  la  Communauté  Européenne)  is  a  standard  European  industry 
classification system and does not have to be congruent with an internal risk based view applied elsewhere in this report.

9  Non-recourse Commercial Real Estate portfolio based on Deutsche Bank’s definition is € 39 billion 

The portfolio is subject to the same credit underwriting requirements stipulated in the bank’s “Principles for Managing Credit 
Risk”, including various controls according to single name, country, industry and product/asset class-specific concentration. 

Material transactions, such as loans underwritten with the intention to sell down or distribute part of the risk to third parties, 
are subject to review and approval by senior credit risk management professionals and (depending upon size) an underwriting 
committee and/or the Management Board. High emphasis is placed on structuring and pricing such transactions so that de-
risking can be achieved in a timely manner and – where Deutsche Bank takes market price risk – to mitigate such market risk. 

The Group’s amortized cost loan exposure within above categories is mostly to good quality borrowers. Moreover, with the 
focus on the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank, loan exposure is subject to further risk mitigation through the bank’s e.g., 
Strategic Corporate Lending unit. 

Deutsche Bank’s household loan exposure is principally associated with Private Bank portfolios.

Annual Report 2023 

Risk and capital performance 
Credit Risk Exposure 

The bank’s amortized cost loan exposure of € 49.3 billion to Real Estate activities as reported above is based on NACE code 
classification and comprises of recourse and non-recourse financing, across various parts of the group and client segment. 
This  includes  25.1 billion  of  loans  which  is  based  on  Deutsch  Bank’s  definition  of  non-recourse  CRE  loans.  For  more 
information on non-recourse CRE loans, see section Focus areas in 2023 in the chapter IFRS 9 Impairment. 

The  Group’s  commercial  real  estate  loans,  primarily  originated  in  the  U.S.  and  Europe,  are  generally  secured  by  first 
mortgages  on  the  underlying  real  estate  property.  Deutsche  Bank  originates  fixed  and  floating  rate  loans  and  selectively 
acquires (generally at substantial discount) sub- /non-performing loans sold by financial institutions. The underwriting process 
is stringent and the exposure is managed under separate portfolio limits. Credit underwriting policy guidelines provide that 
LTV ratios of generally less than 75% are adhered to at loan origination. Additionally, given the significance of the underlying 
collateral, independent external appraisals are commissioned for all secured loans by a valuation team (part of the independent 
Credit Risk Management function) which is also responsible for reviewing and challenging the reported real  estate values 
regularly. Deutsche Bank originates loans for distribution in the banking market or via securitization. In this context Deutsche 
Bank  frequently  retains  a  portion  of  the  syndicated  loans  while  securitized  positions  may  be  entirely  sold  (except  where 
regulation requires retention of economic risk). Mezzanine or other junior tranches of debt are retained only in exceptional 
cases.  The  bank  also  participates  in  conservatively  underwritten  unsecured  lines  of  credit  to  well-capitalized  real  estate 
investment trusts and other real estate operating companies.  

Commercial real estate property valuations and rental incomes can be significantly impacted by macro-economic conditions 
and idiosyncratic events affecting the underlying properties. Accordingly, the portfolio is categorized as higher risk and hence 
subject to the aforementioned tight restrictions on concentration. 

The Group’s credit exposure to ten largest counterparties accounted for 12% of the bank’s aggregated total credit exposure 
in  these  categories  as  of  December 31,  2023,  compared  with  11%  as  of  December 31,  2022.  The  top  ten  counterparty 
exposures were well-rated counterparties or otherwise related to structured trades which show high levels of risk mitigation. 

Deutsche Bank’s exposure to Financial and Insurance Activities is € 381.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 which also includes 
exposures to Asset Backed Securities, Banks, Insurance, Financial intermediaries, Public Sector as well as to Corporates 
including  Holding  Companies.  Exposures  are  managed  using  bespoke  risk  management  frameworks,  trade-by-trade 
approvals  and  relevant  risk  appetite  metrics.  Total  loans  across  all  applicable  measurement  categories  amounted  to 
€ 116.3 billion, total repo and repo style transactions across all applicable measurement categories amounted to € 93.3 billion 
and off-balance sheet activities amounted to € 118.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and were principally associated with 
Investment Bank and Corporate Bank portfolios, which were majorly held in North America and Europe.

The tables above provide an overview of Deutsche Bank’s credit exposure by geographical region, allocated based on the 
counterparty’s country of domicile. The domicile view might differ from any internal risk based view applied elsewhere in this 
report 

The Group’s largest concentration of credit risk within loans from a regional perspective is in its home market Germany, with 
a significant share in households, which includes the majority of the mortgage lending and home loan business. 

Within OTC derivatives, tradable assets as well as repo and repo-style transactions, the largest concentrations from a regional 
perspective were in Europe and North America. 

Credit Exposure Classification 

Deutsche Bank also classifies its credit exposure along business divisions, which is in line with the divisionally aligned chief 
risk  officer  mandates.  The  section  below  discloses  the  credit  exposure  of  the  Corporate  Bank  and  the  Investment  Bank 
together. The subsequent section provides the credit exposure for the Private Bank.

Credit Risk Exposure 

The above tables show an overall increase in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank gross exposure in 2023 of € 29.1 billion 
or 4%. Debt Securities at fair value through profit and loss increased by  € 31.8 billion mainly due to increase in long bond 
inventory  position  in  Government  securities  in  Core  rates  business.  Off-balance  sheet  positions  increased  by€ 6.1 billion 
mainly driven by new commitments issued during the period. Repo and repo-style transactions increased by € 3.5 billion in 
Investment  Bank.  From  a  regional  perspective,  the  increase  was  primarily  attributable  to  counterparties  domiciled  in  the 
Cayman Island, Italy, China and Germany. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in Loans at amortized cost of 
€ 7.2 billion primarily in Corporate Bank and decrease in OTC Derivatives of € 5.4 billion due to reduction in Interest Rate and 
Foreign Exchange Derivative products. 

The  above  table  also  shows  a  material  shift  in  internal  credit  ratings,  primarily  from  Non-Investment  Grade  to  Investment 
Grade.  This  is  attributable  to  a  regulatory-driven  recalibration  of  the  Global  Corporates  and  Leveraged  Finance  related 
scorecards to better reflect observed default histories. 

The  Group  uses  risk  mitigation  techniques  as  described  above  to  optimize  Corporate  Bank  and  Investment  Bank  credit 
exposures and reduce potential credit losses. The tables for “net” exposure disclose the development of the bank’s Corporate 
Bank and Investment Bank credit exposures net of collateral, guarantees and hedges. 

Risk Mitigation for Credit Exposure 

Strategic  Corporate  Lending  (“SCL”)  unit  helps  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  the  bank’s  corporate  credit  exposures. The  notional 
amount  of  SCL’s  risk  reduction  activities  increased  from  € 33.9 billion  as  of  December 31,  2022,  to  € 37.7 billion  as  of 
December 31, 2023.  

As of year-end 2023, SCL mitigated the credit risk of € 32.0 billion of loans and lending-related commitments, through synthetic 
collateralized  loan  obligations  supported  predominantly  by  financial  guarantees.  This  position  totaled  € 27.5 billion  as  of 
December 31, 2022.  

SCL also held credit derivatives with an underlying notional amount of  € 5.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The position 
totaled € 6.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The credit derivatives used for the bank’s portfolio management activities are 
accounted for at fair value. 

The bank makes use of hedging also in other businesses to reduce single name concentration risks and utilizes private risk 
insurance and export credit agency cover to manage noncollateralized exposures.

Consumer  Finance  is  divided into  personal  instalment  loans,  credit  lines  and  credit cards.  Consumer Finance  business is 
uncollateralized, loan risk depends on client quality. Various lending requirements are stipulated, including (but not limited to) 
client rating, maximum loan amounts and maximum tenors, and are adapted to regional conditions and/or circumstances of 
the borrower (i.e., for consumer loans a maximum loan amount taking into account customer net income). Given the largely 
homogeneous nature  of  this  portfolio,  counterparty  credit-worthiness  and  ratings  are predominately  derived by  utilizing  an 
automated decision engine.

Credit Risk Exposure 

Mortgage business is the financing of residential properties (primarily owner-occupied) sold by various business channels in 
Europe, primarily in Germany but also in Spain and Italy. The level of credit risk of the mortgage loan portfolio is determined 
by assessing the quality of the client and the underlying collateral. The loan amounts are generally larger than Consumer 
Finance loans and they are extended for longer time horizons. Based on the bank’s underwriting criteria and processes and 
the diversified portfolio (customers/properties) with respective collateralization, the mortgage portfolio is categorized as lower 
risk, while consumer finance is categorized as high risk. 

Business Finance represents credit products for small businesses, SME up to large corporates. Products range from current 
accounts  and  credit  lines  to  investment  loans  or  revolving  facilities,  factoring,  leasing  and  derivatives.  Clients  are  located 
primarily in Italy and Spain, but credit can also be extended to subsidiaries abroad, mostly in Europe. 

Wealth Management offers customized wealth management solutions and private banking services including discretionary 
portfolio management and traditional and alternative investment solutions, complemented by structured risk  management, 
wealth  planning,  lending  and  family  office  services  for  wealth,  high-net-worth  (HNW)  and  ultra-high-net-worth  (UHNW) 
individuals  and  family  offices.  Wealth  Management’s  total  exposure  is  divided  into  Lombard  Lending  (against  readily 
marketable liquid collateral / securities) and Structured Lending (against less liquid collateral). While the level of credit risk for 
the Lombard portfolio is determined by assessing the quality of the underlying collateral, the level of credit risk for the structured 
portfolio is determined by assessing both the quality of the client and the collateral. Products range from secured Lombard 
and  mortgage  loans  to  current  accounts  (Europe  only),  credit  lines  and  other  loans;  to  a  lesser  extent  derivatives  and 
contingencies. Clients are located globally.

1  When assigning the exposure to the corresponding LTV buckets, the exposure amounts are distributed according to their relative share of the underlying assessed real estate 

value 

The LTV expresses the amount of exposure as a percentage of the underlying real estate value. 

The  Group’s  LTV  ratios  are calculated  using  the  total  exposure  divided  by  the  current determined  value  of the  respective 
properties. These values are monitored and updated if necessary, on a regular basis. The exposure of transactions that are 
additionally backed by liquid collateral is reduced by the respective collateral values, whereas any prior charges increase the 
corresponding total exposure. The LTV calculation includes exposure which is secured by real estate collateral. Any mortgage 
lending exposure that is collateralized exclusively by any other type of collateral is not included in the LTV calculation. 

The creditor’s creditworthiness, the LTV and the quality of collateral is an integral part of the Group’s risk management when 
originating loans and when monitoring and steering the Group’s credit risks. In general, the Group is willing to accept higher 
LTV’s,  the  better  the  creditor’s creditworthiness  is.  Nevertheless,  restrictions of  LTV  apply  e.g.  for countries  with  negative 
economic outlook or expected declines of real estate values. 

As of December 31, 2023, 65% of the Group’s exposure related to the mortgage lending portfolio had an LTV ratio below or 
equal to 50% compared to 63% as on December 31, 2022.

Credit Risk Exposure 

Credit Exposure from Derivatives  

All exchange traded derivatives are cleared through central counterparties (“CCPs”), the rules and regulations of which provide 
for daily margining of all current and future credit risk positions emerging out of such transactions. To the extent possible, the 
bank also uses CCP services for OTC derivative transactions (“OTC clearing”); thereby the bank benefits from the credit risk 
mitigation achieved through the CCP’s settlement system. 

The Dodd-Frank Act provides for an extensive framework for the regulation of OTC derivatives, including mandatory clearing, 
platform trading and transaction reporting of certain OTC derivatives, as well as rules regarding registration, capital, margin, 
business conduct standards, recordkeeping and other requirements for swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major 
swap  participants  and  major  security-based  swap  participants.  The  Dodd-Frank  Act  and  related  CFTC  rules  require  OTC 
clearing in the United States for certain standardized OTC derivative transactions, including certain interest rate swaps and 
index credit default swaps. Margin requirements for non-cleared derivative transactions in the U.S. started in September 2016. 
The European Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories (“EMIR”) 
introduced a number of risk mitigation techniques for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives in 2013 and the reporting of OTC 
and exchange traded derivatives in 2014. Mandatory clearing of certain standardized OTC derivatives transactions in the EU 
began in June 2016, and margin requirements for un-cleared OTC derivative transactions in the EU started in February 2017. 
Deutsche  Bank  implemented  the  exchange  of  both  initial  and  variation  margin  in  the  EU  from  February  2017  for  the  first 
category of counterparties subject to the EMIR margin for un-cleared derivatives requirements.  

The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the most significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. More recently, in September 
2020, the CFTC issued a final rule on the cross-border application of U.S. swap rules, which builds on, and in some cases 
supersedes the CFTC’s cross-border guidance from 2013 and related no-action relief letters. In October 2020, also pursuant 
to  the  Dodd-Frank  Act,  the  CFTC  finalized  regulations  to  impose  position  limits  on  certain  commodities  and  economically 
equivalent swaps, futures and options.  

The SEC has also finalized rules regarding registration, trade reporting, capital, margin, risk mitigation techniques, business 
conduct  standards,  trade  acknowledgement  and  verification,  recordkeeping  and  financial  reporting,  and  cross-border 
requirements  for  security-based  swap  dealers  and  major  security-based  swap  participants.  Compliance  with  these 
requirements was generally required as of November 2021.  

Finally, U.S. prudential regulators (the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Farm 
Credit Administration and the Federal Housing Finance Agency) have adopted final rules establishing margin requirements 
for non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps that are applicable to swap dealers and security-based swap dealers that 
are subject to U.S. prudential regulations (such as Deutsche Bank) in lieu of the CFTC’s and the SEC’s margin rules. Deutsche 
Bank implemented the exchange of both initial and variation margin for uncleared derivatives in the U.S. from September 
2016, for the first category of counterparties subject to the U.S. prudential regulators’ margin requirements. Additional initial 
margin requirements for smaller counterparties have been phased in from September 2017 through September 2022, with the 
relevant compliance dates depending in each case on the transactional volume of the parties and their affiliates.  

The following table shows a breakdown of notional amounts and gross market values for assets and liabilities of exchange 
traded and OTC derivative transactions on the basis of clearing channel.

Development of historic simulation value-at-risk by risk types in 2023 

The  average  value-at-risk  over  2023  was  € 41 million,  which  decreased  by  € 3.3 million  (-8%)  compared  to  the  average 
for 2022; this was primarily driven by roll-off of market volatility in the rolling 1yr period of value-at-risk model. Additionally 
reduced cross currency interest rates exposures under Global Foreign Exchange business as it focused on its flow businesses 
and changes in sovereign bond curve positioning and reduction in overall interest rates exposure under Global Rates business 
also contributed towards lower average value-at-risk for 2023.

The incremental risk charge as at the end of 2023 was € 570 million, which has increased by € 279 million (+96%) compared 
to year-end 2022. The change was driven by increase in sovereign bond inventory for facilitating market making under Global 
Rates and Global Emerging Markets business. 

Results of Regulatory Backtesting of Trading Market Risk 

In 2023, the Group observed one outlier where the Group’s loss on a buy-and-hold and actual basis exceeded the value-at-
risk of the Trading books. This was driven by an increase in market volatility following the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in the first 
quarter of 2023. The market volatility led to moves in interest rates that were larger than those within the preceding one-year 
period used in the value-at-risk calculation. 

The following graph shows the trading units daily buy-and-hold and Actual income in comparison to the value-at-risk as of the 
close  of  the  previous  business day  for the  trading  days  of  the  reporting  period.  The  value-at-risk  is  presented  in  negative 
amounts to visually compare the estimated potential loss of the trading positions with the buy and hold income given buy-and-
hold is the relevant portion of daily profit and loss for comparison against the previous day's value at risk which excludes new 
trades, reserves, and any carry profit and loss ordinarily part of actual income. Figures are shown in millions of euro. The chart 
shows that the trading units achieved a positive buy and hold income for 54% of the trading days in 2023 as well as displays 
the global outlier experienced in 2023.

The economic capital figures do take into account diversification benefits between the different risk types. 

Economic Capital Usage for Non-trading Market Risk totaled € 6.5 billion as of December 31, 2023, which is € 1.6 billion above 
the economic capital usage at year-end 2022. The increase in economic capital was predominantly driven by additional interest 
rate risk positions taken to mitigate downside risk to the Group’s net interest income, higher risk related to behavioral modelling 
assumption for our non-maturity deposit portfolio and a higher market risk contribution from our defined benefit pension plans. 

–  Interest rate risk; economic capital charge for interest rate risk in the banking book, including gap risk, basis risk and option 
risk, such as the risk of a change in client behavior embedded in modelled non-maturity deposits or prepayment risk; in 
total the economic capital usage for December 31, 2023 was € 3.0 billion, compared to € 1.8 billion for December 31, 2022 
–  Credit spread risk; economic capital charge for portfolios in the banking book subject to credit spread risk; economic capital 

usage was € 60 million as of December 31, 2023, versus € 29 million as of December 31, 2022 

–  Equity and Investment risk; economic capital charge for equity risk from a structural short position in the bank’s own share 
price arising from the Group’s equity compensation plans, and from the non-consolidated investment holdings, such as 
strategic  investments  and  alternative  assets  the  economic  capital  usage  was  € 1.0 billion  as  of  December 31,  2023, 
compared to € 841 million as of December 31, 2022 

–  Foreign exchange risk; foreign exchange risk predominantly arises from the Group’s structural position taken to immunize 
the  sensitivity  of  the  bank’s  capital  ratio  against  changes  in  the  exchange  rates.  The  economic  capital  usage  was 
€ 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, versus € 1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 

–  Pension risk; this risk arises from the Group’s defined benefit obligations, including interest rate risk and inflation risk, credit 
spread risk, equity risk and longevity risk. The economic capital usage was € 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared 
to € 803 million as of December 31, 2022 

–  Guaranteed  funds  risk;  economic  capital  usage  was  € 59 million  as  of  December  31,  2023,  versus  € 82 million  as  of

Non-trading Market Risk Exposures 

The  maximum  economic  value  of  equity  loss  was  € (5.1) billion  as  of  December  2023,  compared  to  € (4.6) billion  as  of 
December 2022. As per December 2023 the maximum EVE loss represents 9.0% of Tier 1 Capital. 

The  maximum  economic  value  of  equity  (EVE)  loss  due  to  a  +200  basis  points  parallel  shift  of  the  yield  curve  across  all 
currencies as defined by the BaFin was € (5.1) billion as of December 2023, representing 7.7% of Total Capital. 

The moderate change in economic value of equity loss for the “Parallel up” interest rate scenario was driven by rebalancing 
activities related to the interest rate risk position within the Bank’s Treasury portfolio. Deutsche Bank’s overall interest rate risk 
positioning remains largely unchanged and is managed via defined risk management as part of the IRRBB framework.  

The maximum one-year loss in net interest income (NII) was € (0.3) billion as of December 2023, compared to € (1.2) billion 
as of December 2022. 

The maximum loss for the 12M net interest income sensitivity for “Parallel down“ scenario decreased by circa € 0.8 billion. 

The reduction in the maximum net interest income loss in the “Parallel down” scenario was mainly driven by a combination of 
methodology  enhancements  to  better  reflect  client  behavior  and  changes  of  our  interest  rate  risk  position  in  Treasury  in 
response to the change in interest rate environment.

As of December 31, 2023, operational risk losses decreased by € 20 million, or 3%, to € 582 million. This was primarily driven 
by a gain of € 333 million related to the event type “Internal Fraud”, which reflects a release of litigation provisions. Losses 
under Clients, Products and Business Practices” increased year on year due to increased provisions from civil litigation. Legal 
losses are broadly stable when aggregating settled matters and changes in litigation reserves for unsettled matters across 
categories. 

Operational risk losses by event type occurred in the period 2023 (2018 - 2022)1

The diagram “Distribution of Operational Risk Losses” summarizes the value of net operational risk loss postings by event 
type in 2023, against the average for the comparative five-year period 2018-2022 (in square brackets). The event type “Clients, 
Products and Business Practices” forms the most significant portion of operational losses with a share of € 605 million largely 
made up of settled matters and changes in litigation reserves for unsettled matters. The event type ‘External Fraud’ saw a 
substantial year on year increase, driven by two material litigation cases. The event type ‘Execution, Delivery and Process 
Management’ also significantly increased, primarily due to non-litigation losses. The reduction of losses in event type “Internal 
Fraud” is driven by a release of litigation provisions. 

The diagram “Frequency of Operational Losses” summarizes the operational risk events by event type (based on a count of 
events where losses were first recognized in 2023), related to the average for the comparative five-year period 2018-2022 (in 
brackets). “External Fraud” remains the highest frequency event type although there has been a notable reduction versus the 
five year average. 

Whilst the bank seeks to ensure the comprehensive capture of all operational risk loss events with a net operational risk loss 
impact of € 10,000 or greater, the totals shown in this section may be underestimated due to delayed detection and recording 
of loss events.

Funding Markets and Capital Markets Issuance  

Multiple macro topics emerged during 2023 and weighed on markets, following a normalization after geopolitical events in the 
past  years.  Particularly  impactful  were  the  high  inflation  countered  by  unprecedented  rate  hikes,  continued  geopolitical 
uncertainties, the default of some regional US banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS. Notwithstanding this backdrop, 
the Bank navigated markets well and successfully concluded its issuance activity at 17.2 billion euros. After deducting the 
1.5 billion USD senior-non preferred note issued in November as pre-funding, the overall volume was within the plan of 13-
18 billion euros which was narrowed to a guidance of 14 to 16 billion euros during Q4. 

Looking at the whole year, credit markets showed a constructive performance despite the multiple disruptions with broader 
indices trading tighter versus year end 2022. The bank’s senior non-preferred cash bonds widened on account of the market 
turmoil in March relating to regional U.S. banks and Credit Suisse and underperformed peers until April 2023. Thereafter DB’s 
spreads tightened and outperformed peers. The positive development of DB’s spreads was supported by three rating upgrades 
from DBRS, Fitch and S&P throughout the year. As of year end 2023, DB’s spreads are tighter than at the beginning of the 
year.  

The  total  issuance  volume  of  € 17.2 billion  is  split  as  follows:  € 1.4 billion  in  capital  issuances,  € 6.7 billion  of  senior  non-
preferred  funding,  € 6.0 billion  in  senior  preferred.  The  Group  also  issued  € 2.6 billion  Pfandbriefe  and  € 0.5 billion 
Cédulas. From  a  currency  perspective,  the  total  issuance  volume  is  divided  as  follows:  Euros  (€ 8.5 billion),  U.S.  dollars 
(€ 6.9 billion), Pounds Sterling (€ 0.8 billion) and other currencies aggregated (€ 1.0 billion). The Group’s investor base for 
2023 issuances was as follows: asset managers and pension funds (34%), retail customers (17%), banks (16%), insurance 
companies (8%), Corporates (1%), Governments and agencies (4%) and other institutional investors (20%). The geographical 
distribution  was  split  between  Germany  (41%),  rest  of  Europe  (24%),  U.S.  (26%),  Asia/Pacific  (8%)  and  Other  (1%). The 
average spread of issuance over 3-months-Euribor/RFR (Risk Free Rate) was 164bp for the full year. The average tenor was 
5.1 years. The Group issued the following volumes over each quarter: Q1: € 7.5 billion, Q2: € 2.0 billion, Q3: € 3.1 billion and 
Q4: € 4.7 billion.  

Deutsche Bank’s issuance plan for 2024 is € 13-18 billion and similar to 2023. It comprises capital instruments, senior non-
preferred, senior preferred and covered bonds. The Group also plans to raise a portion of this funding in U.S. dollar and may 
enter into cross currency swaps to manage any residual requirements. The Bank has total capital markets maturities, excluding 
legally exercisable calls, of approximately € 11 billion. Furthermore, the Bank issued structured notes with a volume of EUR 
5.3bn in 2013 and plans to issue € 6-7 billion in 2024. This activity is conducted by the FIC division and not part of the Treasury 
issuance plan. 

Funding Diversification  

In  2023,  total  external  funding  increased  by  € 14.6 billion  from  € 955.7 billion  at  December  31,  2022,  to  € 970.3 billion  at 
December 31, 2023. Funding from the Corporate Bank has increased by € 1.5 billion, whereas deposits in the Private Bank 
have  decreased  by  € 9.6 billion.  For  both  divisions,  there  has  been  a  shift  from  sight  to  term  deposits.  The  unsecured 
Wholesale  Funding  portfolio  increased  by  € 11.4 billion,  thereof  € 2.5 billion  from  Investment  Bank  deposits.  In  addition, 
Capital Markets and Equity increased by € 8.5 billion driven by an increase of € 2.5 billion in Equity and € 6.0 billion in long-
term Debt Issuances. Secured funding and shorts have been overall stable compared to December 31, 2022, with reductions 
from  the  repayment  of  TLTRO  (Targeted  Longer-Term  Refinancing  Operations)  of  € 18.7 billion  as  well  as  a  decrease  of 
€ 6.6 billion in trading liabilities has been offset by an increase of € 23.9 billion in repurchase operations.

As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  Group’s  HQLA  remained  stable  compared  to  December  31,  2022,  at  € 219 billion.  This  is 
primarily due to the repayment of TLTRO liabilities offset by business portfolio movements. The Group maintains additional 
highly liquid central bank eligible assets, not qualifying as HQLA or subject to transfer restrictions under the HQLA definition. 
These additional liquid assets were € 42 billion, such that the Group’s total Liquidity Reserves were € 261 billion as at the end 
of December 31, 2023. As at the end of December 31, 2022, these additional liquid assets were € 37 billion, such that the 
Group’s total Liquidity Reserves were € 256 billion. The 12 month average HQLA in 2023 was € 215 billion as compared with 
€ 218 billion during 2022. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 140% at the end fourth quarter of 2023, a surplus to regulatory requirements of € 62 billion 
as compared to 142% as at the end of fourth quarter of 2022, a surplus to regulatory requirements of € 64 billion. This was 
primarily driven by the ECB TLTRO repayments offset by business portfolio movements.  

The Group’s twelve month weighted average LCR was 137%. This has been calculated in accordance with the Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 and the EBA Guidelines on LCR disclosure to complement the disclosure of liquidity risk 
management under Article 435 CRR.

The  Net  Stable  Funding  Ratio  was  121%  at  the  end  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023,  a  surplus  to  regulatory  requirements  of 
€ 107 billion  as  compared  to  120%  as  at  the  end  of  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022,  a  surplus  to  regulatory  requirements  of 
€ 99 billion. This was primarily driven by business portfolio movements offset by ECB TLTRO repayments.

Liquidity Risk Exposure 

Asset Encumbrance  

This section refers to asset encumbrance in the group of institutions consolidated for banking regulatory purposes pursuant 
to the German Banking Act. Therefore, this excludes insurance companies or companies outside the finance sector. Assets 
pledged by our insurance subsidiaries are included in Note 20 “Assets Pledged and Received as Collateral” of the consolidated 
financial  statements,  and  restricted  assets  held  to  satisfy  obligations  to  insurance  companies’  policy  holders  are  included 
within Note 37 “Information on Subsidiaries” of the consolidated financial statements. 

Encumbered assets primarily comprise those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are pledged as collateral against secured 
funding, collateral swaps, and other collateralized obligations. Additionally, in line with EBA technical standards on regulatory 
asset encumbrance reporting, assets placed with settlement systems, including default funds and initial margins, as well as 
other assets pledged which cannot be freely withdrawn such as mandatory minimum reserves at central banks, are considered 
encumbered. We also include derivative margin receivable assets as encumbered under these EBA guidelines. 

Readily available assets are those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are not otherwise encumbered, and which are in 
freely transferrable form. Unencumbered financial assets at fair value, other than securities borrowed or purchased under 
resale  agreements  and  positive  market  value  from  derivatives,  and  available  for  sale  investments  are  all  assumed  to  be 
readily available. 

The readily available value represents the on- and off-balance sheet carrying amount or fair value rather than any form of 
stressed liquidity value (see the “High Quality Liquid Assets” for an analysis of unencumbered liquid assets available under a 
liquidity stress scenario). Other unencumbered on- and off-balance sheet assets are those assets that have not been pledged 
as collateral against secured funding or other collateralized obligations or are otherwise not considered to be readily available. 
Included  in  this  category  are  securities  borrowed  or  purchased  under  resale  agreements  and  positive  market  value  from 
derivatives. Similarly, for loans and other advances to customers, these would only be viewed as readily available to the extent 
they are already in a pre-packaged transferrable format and have not already been used to generate funding. This represents 
the most conservative view given that an element of such loans currently shown in Other assets could be packaged into a 
format that would be suitable for use to generate funding.

Maturity Analysis of Assets and Financial Liabilities 

Treasury manages the maturity analysis of assets and liabilities. Modeling of assets and liabilities is necessary in cases where 
the contractual maturity does not adequately reflect the liquidity risk position. The most significant example in this context 
would be immediately repayable deposits from retail and transaction banking customers which have consistently displayed 
high stability throughout even the most severe financial crises. 

The modeling profiles are part of the overall liquidity risk management framework (see section “Liquidity Stress Testing and 
Scenario Analysis” for short-term liquidity positions ≤ 1 year and section “Structural Funding” for long-term liquidity positions 
> 1 year) which is defined and approved by the Management Board.

Sustainability 

Sustainability, which encompasses ESG dimensions, has been a key element of Deutsche Bank’s strategy since 2019 and 
one of the three thematic pillars that underpin Deutsche Bank’s corporate strategy – along with macro-economic shifts and 
technology. In 2023, the bank continued to focus on four pillars of its sustainability strategy: Sustainable Finance, Policies & 
Commitments, People & Own Operations as well as Thought Leadership & Stakeholder Engagement. Making progress along 
these  four  pillars  is  aimed  at  enabling  the  bank  to  maximize  its  contribution  to  the  achievement  of  the  Paris  Climate 
Agreement’s  targets  and  the  United  Nations  (UN)  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  Deutsche  Bank  endorsed  multiple 
universal  sustainability  frameworks  and  initiatives.  The  bank  is  a  member  of  the  UN’s  Environment  Programme  Finance 
Initiative (1992) and signatory to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact (2000), the Principles for Responsible Investment 
(through DWS, 2008), the Principles for Responsible Banking (2019) and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (2021).  

The bank further integrated the oversight of sustainability-related issues into governance structures on several levels, ranging 
from the Supervisory Board and the Group Sustainability Committee to senior business  leadership, key infrastructure and 
control  functions  as  well  as  specialist  teams.  The  bank’s  sustainability  governance  includes  two  key  committees  and  one 
council devoted entirely to sustainability.  

The Group Sustainability Committee acts as the main governance and decision-making body for sustainability related matters 
across the Deutsche Bank Group. The committee is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Sustainability Officer 
(Vice Chair). Its “run the bank”-mandate has oversight of sustainability strategy implementation across divisions and ensures 
alignment of the sustainability strategy with the bank’s corporate strategy. The Sustainability Strategy Steering Committee 
oversees the implementation of Deutsche Bank’s sustainability strategy as one of the bank’s “Key Deliverables” (“change the 
bank”  priorities).  The  Sustainability  Council  fosters  knowledge  exchange  between  the  bank’s  sustainability  champions  to 
support bank-wide change and to identify new topics.  

Deutsche Bank’s Chief Sustainability Officer reports to the Chief Executive Officer. He has the mandate to develop the bank’s 
sustainability  strategy  across  businesses,  infrastructure  functions  and  regions  and  drive  its  implementation.  The  Chief 
Sustainability  Office  consists  of  three  areas:  the  Strategy  &  Regional  Governance  team,  which  is  responsible  for  the 
development of the corporate sustainability strategy and regional governance set-up. The Regional Governance sub-team 
was  established  in  2023  with  a  mandate  to  define  and  implement  regional  sustainability  governance  structures  globally. 
Furthermore, the Execution, Data & Regulatory team, which is responsible for driving the strategic transformation program 
and identifying and assessing relevant regulations. In 2023, the bank’s Sustainability Regulation function was established as 
a central function focusing on interpretation of key sustainability regulations and standards globally on a group wide basis 
within the Execution, Data & Regulatory team. The third team, Group Sustainability, is responsible for advancing the bank’s 
sustainability policies and commitments, human rights issues and their monitoring and the dialogue with external stakeholders, 
including  ESG  rating  management.  In  2023,  Deutsche  Bank  appointed  a  dedicated  Head  of  Human  Rights  within  Group 
Sustainability to further strengthen its human rights management. Moreover, the bank’s business divisions and infrastructure 
functions established ESG expert teams to foster the sustainability strategy implementation on divisional level and to enable 
swift response to emerging business opportunities and risks.  

The transformation of the bank with regard to sustainability-related targets and goals is a component for the bank's top 
executives' performance-based compensation.  

In DWS, the DWS Executive Board is supported by the DWS Group Sustainability Committee, which is empowered to take 
decisions that implement the sustainability strategy. 

Sustainable Finance 

Deutsche Bank set the target to achieve cumulative sustainable financing and ESG investment volumes of € 500 billion in the 
period from January 2020 to end of 2025 (excluding DWS); which transactions can be classified as sustainable is documented  
in Deutsche Bank’s Sustainable Finance Framework and published on Deutsche Bank’s website.

Policies and Commitments  

In March 2023, Deutsche Bank updated its thermal coal guideline by tightening the criteria when a company is deemed a 
thermal coal company and in scope of the guideline, as well as specifying the requirements to be applied to clients in scope 
of the updated guideline.  

As the first banking partner of the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA), Deutsche Bank signed the #BackBlue 
ocean  finance  commitment,  which  ensures  that  ocean  protection  is  incorporated  in  finance  and  insurance  decisions,  in 
December 2023. Moreover, the bank engaged in the Impact Disclosure Taskforce along with other financial institutions with 
the aim to scale financing of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 

The bank further enhanced its risk management and related processes to prevent human rights violations in its supply chain 
in accordance with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCDDA).  

As part of its Net-Zero Banking Alliance commitment, Deutsche Bank published its initial Transition Plan in 
October 2023, summarizing its decarbonization strategy and actions along three dimensions: own operations (Scope 1 and 2), 
supply chain (disclosed Scope 3: Category 1 to 14); and the financing the bank provides to its clients (Scope 3: Category 15). 
Along  with  this publication,  the  bank  announced  three additional  sectoral  emission  reduction  targets  in  the  corporate  loan 
portfolio for Shipping, Cement and Coal Mining after having published pathway targets for four sectors in the previous year 
(i.e.,  Oil  &  Gas,  Automotive,  Power  Generation  and  Steel).  In  addition  to  that,  the  bank  set  the  ambition  that  from  2026 
onwards, at least 90% of the high emitting clients in the most carbon intensive sectors that engage in new corporate lending 
transactions with Deutsche Bank shall have a net-zero commitment in place.  

People and Own Operations 

From end of 2019 to end of September 2023, Deutsche Bank reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 71%, to 44,814 tones of 
CO2e. In 2023, the bank received 97% of its own global electricity consumption from renewable sources and is on its way to 
achieve its 100% renewable electricity target by 2025. 

Deutsche Bank continued to engage with vendors to reduce Scope 3 carbon emissions focusing on Purchased Goods and 
Services (Scope 3: Category 1), representing 78% of total operational Scope 3 emissions from October 2022 to September 
2023 (excluding financed emissions, Scope 3: Category 15).  

32.3% of Managing Director, Director and Vice President positions were held by women by end of 2023. 

In addition, Deutsche Bank rolled out a “Sustainable Finance” training for client facing staff, contributed to conserve marine 
biodiversity as part of one of the bank’s environmental CSR programs “How We Live” and funded community conservation 
projects in several Asian-Pacific countries by partnering with The Nature Conservancy.  

Thought Leadership and Stakeholder Engagement  

Deutsche Bank’s Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing became a member in the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero 
(GFANZ) Principals Group in July 2023.  

In March 2023, Deutsche Bank hosted its second Sustainability Deep Dive. At the event senior leaders spoke to almost 1,700 
clients, investors, analysts, and employees about the sustainability strategy and how Deutsche Bank supports its clients on 
their way to net-zero. At the 2023 UN climate conference in Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Deutsche Bank co-hosted a client 
event and panel discussions on “Decarbonizing Industry: A German Lense” with six German industry partners as well as the 
Future Institute for Sustainable Transformation of the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin.  

In October 2023, the bank set up a Nature Advisory Panel, which aims to help the bank assess nature-related risks and identify 
new financial product offerings tied to the challenge of reversing biodiversity loss. In addition to that, Deutsche Bank acted as 
Co-Lead of Net-Zero Banking Alliance’s Real Estate Working Group and played a major role in the publication of its emerging 
practice paper on “Climate Target Setting for Real Estate Sector Financing”.

Post-Employment Benefit Plans 

The Group sponsors a number of post-employment benefit plans on behalf of the Group’s employees, both defined contribution 
plans and defined benefit plans.  

In  the  Group’s  globally  coordinated  accounting  process  covering  defined  benefit  plans  with  a  defined  benefit  obligation 
exceeding  € 2 million  the  Group’s  global  actuary  reviews  the  valuations  provided  by  locally  appointed  actuaries  in  each 
country. 

By applying the Group’s global principles for determining the financial and demographic assumptions the Group ensures that 
the assumptions are best-estimate, unbiased and mutually compatible, and that they are globally consistent. 

For a further discussion on the Group’s employee benefit plans see Note 33 “Employee Benefits” to the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.  

Talent acquisition 

In 2023, labor market conditions normalized and as a result employee turnover rates decreased significantly in all regions. 
Voluntary staff turnover rates declined from 10.1% in 2022 to 5.6% in 2023. 

In 2023, recruiting talent remained a key priority for the bank. Hiring focused on filling front office roles in growth areas (such 
as at Corporate Bank, Investment Bank, Private Bank and Asset Management), strengthening the control- and IT-function, 
replacing operation-center employees who left voluntarily and onboarding talents to meet the growing demand for regulatory 
roles (such as Client Lifecycle Management and Anti-Financial Crime). 

The bank remains committed to its strategic priority of hiring university graduates. In 2023, the bank hired 1,177 university 
graduates (2022: 793). The bank also insourced 1,308 external roles (2022: 1,806), particularly in IT. 

Promoting internal career mobility 

Internal  mobility  plays  a  vital  role  in  developing  and  retaining  qualified,  talented  employees  and  ensuring  that  the  bank 
continues  to  benefit  from  their  expertise  and  experience.  The  bank  fosters  mobility  between  divisions,  which  enables 
employees  to  broaden  their  skills  and  experience.  Moreover,  internal  mobility  helps  reduce  the  bank’s  redundancy  and 
recruitment costs. 

In 2023, Deutsche Bank continued to implement its internal mobility strategy and live up to its commitment to filling one-third 
of  all  vacant  positions  with  suitable  candidates  from  within  the  organization.  Vacant  positions  are  typically  first  advertised 
inside the group for at least two weeks. Prioritizing internal candidates helps employees affected by restructuring find new 
roles in the bank. 

In 2023, 29.9% (2022: 27.3%) of all job vacancies were filled internally (2022 excluding Postbank). On average, it took 89 days 
to fill vacant positions (2022: 86 days).

Diversity, equity, and Inclusion 

Diversity, equity, and Inclusion 

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are the foundations on which the bank’s values are built and are pre-requisites for its 
Global Hausbank ambitions. The bank aims to attract, develop, and retain talented employees from all cultures, countries, 
races,  ethnicities,  genders,  sexual  orientations,  disabilities,  beliefs,  backgrounds,  and  experiences.  To  better  reflect  the 
diversity of the societies in which it operates and the clients it serves, the bank has an ambition to increase the number of 
women and people of all ethnicities in senior, decision-making and client facing roles. The bank wants all its employees to feel 
a  sense  of  belonging  by  creating  an  inclusive  work  environment  where  everyone  feels  welcomed,  respected,  listened  to, 
treated fairly, and can contribute and grow. 

Throughout 2023 the bank continued to embed diversity, equity and inclusion in its culture and employee practices by including 
supporting the advancement of women and members of other under-represented, groups. The bank takes a multi-dimensional 
approach including targeted outreach to attract and hire diverse talent, enhanced career planning, leadership development, 
exposure  opportunities  and  senior  leader  sponsorship.  The  bank  continues  to  equip  its  people  with  resources  to  practice 
inclusion and understand how to make equitable people-related decisions. 

At year-end 2023, eight or 40% of Supervisory Board members were women (2022: 30%). This met the statutory requirement 
of 30% for publicly listed and codetermined German companies pursuant to gender quota legislation that took effect in 2015. 

The  current  German  Gender  Quota  Law  (Zweites  Führungspositionen-Gesetz,  FüPoG  II)  requires  appointing  at  least  one 
woman and one man to a management board with more than three members, no additional goals must be laid down. With 
Rebecca Short on the Management Board the bank met this requirement as of December 31, 2023. 

As part of the bank’s 35 by 25 commitment, the bank aims to have women to represent at least 35% of its Managing Director, 
Director,  and  Vice  President  population  by  2025  (Business  Divisions  (excluding  Asset  Management)  and  Infrastructure 
Functions).  This  goal  also  forms  part  of  the  key  performance  indicators  on  the  “Balanced  Scorecard”  assessing  the 
Management Board and Group Management Committee. Gender diversity for senior corporate titles increased by 1.6%-points 
to 32.3% in 2023 (2022: 30.7%).  

The bank also plans to have at least 30% women in the positions one and two levels below the Management Board (Business 
Divisions  (excluding  Asset  Management)  and  Infrastructure  Functions).  Gender  diversity  in  position  one  below  the 
Management  Board  increased  by  2.9%-points  to  20.0%  in  2023  (2022:  17.1%)  and  decreased  in  position  two  below  the 
Management Board by 2.0%-points to 27.6% in 2023 (2022: 29.6%).  

The bank is committed to increasing the proportion of women in senior leadership positions across the organization, but it is 
the bank’s individual businesses that deliver on this commitment. Since cultures and social challenges vary by country and 
type of business, each of the bank’s regions and business has its own diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The bank has 
put in place targeted initiatives to accelerate change. These initiatives have been implemented along the full employee life 
cycle, from attracting and hiring talent to developing, retaining, and promoting it. The 35 by 25 program is sponsored and 
actively supported by the Management Board and Group Management Committee. Since 2023, each of the bank's decision-
making  committees  is  required  to  regularly  review  its  composition  to  improve  diversity  of  thought  and  support  the  bank's 
commitment to increase the proportion of women in senior, decision making roles.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Risks in Financial Reporting 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

General 

Management of Deutsche Bank and its consolidated subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICOFR). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under 
the supervision of our Chairman of the Supervisory Board and our Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting. In addition to the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements 
for  external  reporting  purposes  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  as  issued  by  the 
International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IASB)  and  endorsed  by  the  European  Union  (EU).  Our  Internal  control  over 
financial reporting includes our disclosure controls and procedures designed to prevent misstatements. 

Risks in Financial Reporting 

The primary risks in financial reporting are that either financial statements do not present a true and fair view due to inadvertent 
or intentional  errors  (fraud)  or the  publication  of  financial  statements  is  not performed  on  a  timely  basis.  These  risks  may 
reduce investor confidence or cause reputational damage and may have legal consequences including banking regulatory 
interventions.  A  lack  of  fair  presentation  arises  when  one  or  more  financial  statement  amounts,  or  disclosures  contain 
misstatements (or omissions) that are material. Misstatements are deemed material if they could, individually or in aggregate, 
influence economic decisions that users make because of the financial statements. 

To confine those risks of financial reporting, management of the Group has established internal control over financial reporting 
with the aim of providing reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements. In addition, an assessment 
was conducted of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control over financial reporting. This was based on the Internal 
Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO).  COSO  recommends  the  establishment  of  specific  objectives  to  facilitate  the  design  and  evaluate adequacy  of  a 
control system. As a result, in establishing internal control over financial reporting, management has adopted the following 
financial statement objectives: 

–  Existence - assets and liabilities exist and transactions have occurred;  
–  Completeness - all transactions are recorded and account balances are included in the financial statements;  
–  Valuation - assets, liabilities and transactions are recorded in the financial statements at the appropriate amounts;  
–  Rights, Obligations and Ownership – rights, obligations and ownership are appropriately recorded as assets and liabilities;  
–  Presentation and Disclosures - classification, disclosure and presentation of financial reporting is appropriate;  
–  Safeguarding of assets - unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets is prevented or detected in a timely manner.  

However, any internal control system, including internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived and 
operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute assurance that the objectives of that control system are met. As such, 
disclosure  controls  and  procedures  or  systems  for  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  all  errors; 
inadvertent  or  intentional  errors  (fraud).  Furthermore,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods,  are 
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that 
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 

Controls to Minimize the Risk of Financial Reporting Misstatement 

The system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

–  Pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records,  that,  in  reasonable  detail  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and 

dispositions of the company’s assets;  

–  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made 
only in accordance with authorizations of the company’s management and;  

–  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of 

the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Risks in Financial Reporting 

Measuring Effectiveness of Internal Control 

Each year, management of the Group undertakes a formal evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of 
internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  This  evaluation  incorporates  an  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  control 
environment as well as individual controls which make up the system of internal control over financial reporting and considers: 

–  The  financial  misstatement  risk  of  the  financial  statement  line  items,  considering  such  factors  as  materiality  and  the 

susceptibility of the financial statement item to misstatement; and,  

–  The susceptibility of identified controls to failure, considering such factors as the degree of automation, complexity, and 

risk of management override, competence of personnel and the level of judgment required.  

These factors determine in their entirety the type and scope of the evidence required by § 315 HGB, which the management 
needs  to  assess  whether  or  not  the  established  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  effective.  The  evidence  itself  is 
generated from procedures integrated within the daily responsibilities of staff or from procedures implemented specifically for 
purposes  of  the  internal  control  over financial  reporting  evaluation. Information  from  other sources also  form an  important 
component of the evaluation since such evidence may either bring additional control issues to the attention of management 
or may corroborate findings. Such information sources may include: 

–  Reports on audits carried out by or on behalf of regulatory authorities;  
–  External Auditor reports; and, 
–  Reports commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of outsourced processes to third parties.  

In  addition,  Group  Audit  evaluates  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  by 
performing periodic and ad-hoc risk-based audits. Reports are produced summarizing the results from each audit which are 
distributed to the responsible managers for the activities concerned. These reports also provide evidence to support the annual 
evaluation by management of the overall operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 

As a result of the evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting is appropriately designed 
and operating effectively as of December 31, 2023.

Restrictions on Voting Rights or the Transfer of Shares 

Under Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act the voting right of the affected shares is excluded by law. As far as 
the bank or its subsidiaries held own shares during the year of 2023 in its portfolio according to Section 71b of the German 
Stock Corporation Act no rights could be exercised. Similar restrictions combined with restrictions on disposal are contractually 
imposed on employees who have been granted shares as deferred compensation with a holding obligation. The bank is not 
aware of any other restrictions on voting rights or the transfer of shares. 

Shareholdings which Exceed 10% of the Voting Rights 

The  German  Securities  Trading  Act  (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz)  requires  that  any  investor  whose  share  of  voting  rights 
reaches, exceeds or falls below certain thresholds as the result of purchases, disposals or otherwise, must notify the bank 
and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) thereof. The lowest threshold is 3%. The bank is not aware 
of any shareholder holding directly or indirectly 10% or more of the voting rights.

Annual Report 2023 

Information pursuant to Section 315a (1) of the German Commercial Code and Explanatory Report 
Rules Governing the Amendment of the Articles of Association 

Rules Governing the Appointment and Replacement of 
Members of the Management Board 

Pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Section 84) and the Articles of Association of Deutsche Bank (Section 6) the 
members of the Management Board are appointed by the Supervisory Board. The number of Management Board members 
is determined by the Supervisory Board. According to the Articles of Association, the Management Board has at least three 
members.  The  Supervisory  Board  may  appoint  one  or  two  members  of  the  Management  Board  as  Chairpersons  of  the 
Management Board. Members of the Management Board may be appointed for a maximum term of up to five years. They 
may be reappointed or have their term extended for one or more terms of up to a maximum of five years each. The German 
Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz; Section 31) requires a majority of at least two thirds of the members of the 
Supervisory Board to appoint members of the Management Board. If such majority is not achieved, the Mediation Committee 
shall give, within one month, a recommendation for the appointment to the Management Board. The Supervisory Board will 
then  appoint  the  members  of  the  Management  Board  with  the  majority  of  its  members.  If  such  appointment  fails,  the 
Chairperson of the Supervisory Board shall have two votes in a new vote. If a required member of the Management Board 
has  not  been  appointed,  the  Local  Court  (Amtsgericht)  in  Frankfurt  am  Main  shall,  in  urgent  cases,  make  the  necessary 
appointments upon motion by any party concerned (Section 85 of the Stock Corporation Act). 

Pursuant to the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) and Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 of the European Central Bank 
(SSM Framework Regulation) evidence must be provided to the European Central Bank (ECB), the German Federal Financial 
Supervisory  Authority  (BaFin)  and  the  Deutsche  Bundesbank  that  the  member  of  the  Management  Board  has  adequate 
theoretical and practical experience of the businesses of the Bank as well as managerial experience before the member is 
appointed (Sections 24 (1) No. 1 and 25c (1) of the Banking Act, Article 93 of the SSM Framework Regulation). 

The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of an individual as member of the Management Board or as Chairperson 
of the Management Board for good cause. Such cause includes in particular a gross breach of duties, the inability to manage 
the Bank properly or a vote of no-confidence by the shareholders’ meeting (Hauptversammlung, referred to as the General 
Meeting), unless such vote of no-confidence was made for obviously arbitrary reasons. 

The ECB or the BaFin may appoint a special representative and transfer to such special representative the responsibility and 
powers of individual members of the Management Board if such members are not trustworthy or do not have the required 
competencies or if the credit institution does not have the required number of Management Board members. In any such case, 
the responsibility and powers of the Management Board members concerned are suspended (Section 45c (1) through (3) of 
the Banking Act, Article 93 (2) of the SSM Framework Regulation). 

Rules Governing the Amendment of the Articles of Association  

Any  amendment  of  the  Articles  of  Association  requires  a  resolution  of  the  General  Meeting  (Section  179  of  the  Stock 
Corporation Act). The authority to amend the Articles of Association in so far as such amendments merely relate to the wording, 
such as changes of the share capital as a result of the issuance out of authorized capital, has been assigned to the Supervisory 
Board by the Articles of Association of Deutsche Bank (Section 20 (3)). Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the resolutions 
of the General Meeting are taken by a simple majority of votes and, in so far as a majority of capital stock is required, by a 
simple  majority  of  capital  stock,  except  where  law  or  the  Articles  of  Association  determine  otherwise  (Section  20  (1)). 
Amendments to the Articles of Association become effective upon their entry in the Commercial Register (Section 181 (3) of 
the Stock Corporation Act).

Powers of the Management Board to Issue or Buy Back Shares 

Powers of the Management Board to Issue or Buy Back Shares 

The Annual General Meeting of May 27, 2021 authorized the Management Board pursuant to Section 71 (1) No. 7 of the Stock 
Corporation Act to buy and sell, for the purpose of securities trading, own shares of Deutsche Bank AG on or before April 
30, 2026, at prices which do not exceed or fall short by more than 10% of the average of the share prices (closing auction 
prices of the Deutsche Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) 
on the respective three preceding stock exchange trading days. In this context, the shares acquired for this purpose may not, 
at the end of any day, exceed 5% of the share capital of Deutsche Bank AG. 

The Annual General Meeting of May 17, 2023 authorized the Management Board pursuant to Section 71 (1) No. 8 of the Stock 
Corporation Act to buy, on or before April 30, 2028, own shares of Deutsche Bank AG in a total volume of up to 10% of the 
share capital at the time the resolution was taken or – if the value is lower – of the share capital at the time this authorization 
is exercised. Together with own shares acquired for trading purposes and/or for other reasons and which are from time to time 
in the company’s possession or attributable to the company pursuant to Sections 71a et seq. of the Stock Corporation Act, 
the own shares purchased on the basis of this authorization may not at any time exceed 10% of the company’s respectively 
applicable share capital. The own shares may be bought through the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer 
to  all  shareholders.  The  consideration  for  the  purchase  of  shares  (excluding  ancillary  purchase  costs)  through  the  stock 
exchange may not be more than 10% higher or more than 20% lower than the average of the share prices (closing auction 
prices of the Deutsche Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) 
on the last three stock exchange trading days before the obligation to purchase. In the case of a public purchase offer, it may 
not be more than 10% higher or more than 20% lower than the average of the share prices (closing auction prices of the 
Deutsche Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on the last 
three stock exchange trading days before the day of publication of the offer. If the volume of shares offered in a public purchase 
offer exceeds the planned buyback volume, acceptance must be in proportion to the shares offered in each case. The preferred 
acceptance of small quantities of up to 50 of the company’s shares offered for purchase per shareholder may be defined. 

The Management Board has also been authorized to dispose of the purchased shares and of any shares purchased on the 
basis of previous authorizations pursuant to Section 71 (1) No. 8 of the Stock Corporation Act on the stock exchange or by an 
offer  to  all  shareholders.  The  Management  Board  has  been  authorized  to  dispose  of  the  purchased  shares  against 
contribution-in  kind  and  with  the  exclusion  of  shareholders’  pre-emptive  rights  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring  companies  or 
shareholdings in companies or other assets that serve the company’s business operations.  

The Management Board has also been authorized to use shares purchased on the basis of authorizations pursuant to Section 
71 (1) No. 8 Stock Corporation Act to issue staff shares, with the exclusion of shareholders’ pre-emptive rights, to employees 
and retired employees of the company and its affiliated companies or to use them to service option rights on shares of the 
company and/or rights or duties to purchase shares of the company granted to employees or members of executive or non-
executive management bodies of the company and of affiliated companies. 

Furthermore, the Management Board has been authorized, with the exclusion of shareholders’ pre-emptive rights, to sell such 
own shares to third parties against cash payment if the purchase price is not substantially lower than the price of the shares 
on the stock exchange at the time of sale. Use may only be made of this authorization if it has been ensured that the number 
of  shares  sold  on  the  basis  of  this  authorization  does  not  exceed  10%  of  the  company’s  share  capital  at  the  time  this 
authorization becomes effective or – if the amount is lower – at the time this authorization is exercised. Shares that are issued 
or sold during the validity of this authorization with the exclusion of pre-emptive rights, in direct or analogous application of 
Section 186 (3) sentence 4 Stock Corporation Act, are to be included in the maximum limit of 10% of the share capital. Also 
to be included are shares that are to be issued to service option and/or conversion rights from convertible bonds, bonds with 
warrants, convertible participatory rights or participatory rights, if these bond or participatory rights are issued during the validity 
of this authorization with the exclusion of pre-emptive rights in corresponding application of Section 186 (3) sentence 4 Stock 
Corporation Act. 

The Management Board has also been authorized to cancel shares acquired on the basis of this or a preceding authorization 
without the execution of this cancellation process requiring a further resolution by the General Meeting.

Significant Agreements which Take Effect, Alter or Terminate upon a Change of Control of the 
Company Following a Takeover Bid 

The Annual General Meeting of May 17, 2023 authorized the Management Board pursuant to Section 71 (1) No. 8 of the Stock 
Corporation Act to execute the purchase of shares under the resolved authorization also with the use of put and call options 
or forward purchase contracts. The company may accordingly sell to third parties put options based on physical delivery and 
buy call options from third parties if it is ensured by the option conditions that these options are fulfilled only with shares which 
themselves were acquired subject to compliance with the principle of equal treatment. All share purchases based on put or 
call options are limited to shares in a maximum volume of 5% of the actual share capital at the time of the resolution by the 
General Meeting on this authorization. The term of the options must be selected such that the share purchase upon exercising 
the option is carried out at the latest on April 30, 2028. 

The purchase price to be paid for the shares upon exercise of the put options or upon the maturity of the forward purchase 
may not exceed more than 10% or fall below 10% of the average of the share prices (closing auction prices of the Deutsche 
Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on the last three 
stock exchange trading days before conclusion of the respective transaction in each case excluding ancillary purchase costs 
but taking into account the option premium received. The call options may only be exercised if the purchase price to be paid 
does not exceed by more than 10% or fall below 10% of the average of the share prices (closing auction prices of the Deutsche 
Bank share in Xetra trading and/or in a comparable successor system on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on the last three 
stock exchange trading days before the acquisition of the shares. 

To  the  sale  and  cancellation  of  shares  acquired  with  the  use  of  derivatives  the  general  rules  established  by  the  General 
Meeting apply.

Deutsche Bank AG Performance 

Standalone parent company information (HGB)  

Introduction 

Deutsche Bank AG is the parent company of Deutsche Bank Group and its most material component. The management of 
Deutsche Bank Group is based on IFRS results of the bank’s corporate divisions. Deutsche Bank AG is fully integrated in the 
initiatives and target setting of Deutsche Bank Group. The performance of the Group is ultimately driving the performance of 
Deutsche Bank AG. Further, the bank has utilized the option under Section 2a of the German Banking Act (KWG) with respect 
to regulatory capital so that regulatory capital ratios are only applicable on Group level.  

Therefore, information that has been provided regarding Deutsche Bank Group in this combined management report in general 
also is relevant and applies to Deutsche Bank AG. Additional information that facilitates an understanding of Deutsche Bank 
AG is contained in this section. The financial information in this section has been prepared in accordance with the German 
Commercial Code (“Handelsgesetzbuch”, HGB), unless stated otherwise. Further details on financial information prepared in 
accordance with HGB can be found in the notes to the financial statements for Deutsche Bank AG in a separate report. 

Deutsche Bank AG Performance 

One  parameter  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  Group  is  the  ability  to  make  distributions  to  shareholders.  This  ability 
depends on the availability of distributable profits of Deutsche Bank AG determined in accordance with HGB. Beyond that the 
financial information of Deutsche Bank AG prepared in accordance with HGB is generally less relevant to assess or steer the 
Group’s financial performance due to the circumstances set forth in the introduction above.  

In 2023, Deutsche Bank AG recorded a net profit of € 5.0 billion compared to net profit of € 5.5 billion in 2022. 

The operating profit of € 5.5 billion was higher by € 5.7 billion compared to prior year. Improved trading results and higher 
current income led to an increase of total revenues by € 2.2 billion compared to prior year. In addition, lower interest rate levels 
at year end drove an increase in the return from pension plan assets by € 1.9 billion and higher result from securities of the 
liquidity reserve, up by € 1.1 billion.  

The  result  outside  operating  profit  was  mainly  driven  by  net  negative  valuation  adjustments  of  investments  in  affiliated 
companies  of  € 740 million  and  by  a  net  extraordinary  result  of  negative  € 157 million.  Partly  offsetting,  a  tax  benefit  of 
€ 646 million contributed to the net income of € 5.0 billion.  

The Management Board and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting to pay a dividend of € 0.45 per 
share, appropriate € 2.0 billion to the revenue reserves and to carry forward the remaining distributable profit.

Net interest income 

Net interest income increased by € 255 million to € 10.5 billion in 2023. Current income, up by € 625 million, benefitted from 
contributions from affiliated companies. The net interest result from lending and securities less interest expenses deceased 
slightly by € 370 million, mainly driven by a higher increase of interest on liabilities compared to interest revenue from assets. 

Net commission income 

Net commission income of € 6.2 billion increased by € 129 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher fee 
net income from intermediary and other services rendered. 

Net trading result 

Net trading result in 2023 was € 4.8 billion, an increase of € 1.9 billion compared to prior year. This increase was mainly driven 
by reduced expenses for currency translation.

The number of employees in Germany increased mainly driven by increases in the Corporate Bank and by strengthening the 
IT- and control functions. In Europe excluding Germany the number of employees increased primarily in UK mainly driven by 
increases in the Investment Bank and by strengthening the control functions. 

Other  administrative  costs  were  € 10.1 billion  in  2023,  an  increase  of  € 322 million  from  € 9.8 billion  in  2022.  Other 
administrative expenses (excluding scheduled depreciation and amortization on tangible and intangible assets) increased by 
€ 290 million to € 8.9 billion. This development was mainly driven by higher costs for services rendered by group companies, 
up by € 328 million and higher operating and maintenance costs, up by € 127 million, partly offset by lower bank levies, down 
by  € 219 million.  Scheduled  depreciation  and  amortization  of  tangible  and  intangible  assets  were  € 1.2 billion  in  2023,  up 
by € 32 million. 

Net balance of operating income and expenses 

The  balance  of  other  operating  income/expenses  amounted  to  positive  € 929 million  in  2023  after  negative  € 1.3 billion  in 
2022. This improvement of € 2.2 billion was mainly driven by lower net expenses on pension plan assets and staff related 
provisions, down by € 1.9 billion. 

Net risk provisioning 

In 2023, total net risk provisioning, consisting of changes in credit related risk provisioning and the net result from securities 
held in the liquidity reserve, amounted to € 514 million, a reduction by € 1.1 billion compared to 2022. This development was 
almost completely attributable to an improved net result from securities held in the liquidity reserve, up by € 1.1 billion, whereas 
provisioning in the loan business remained nearly unchanged. The improved net result from securities held in the liquidity 
reserve was caused by the decrease in interest rate levels at year-end 2023, leading to higher valuations. 

Net balance of other ordinary income/expenses 

The balance of other ordinary income and expenses was negative € 956 million (2022: positive € 3.8 billion), consisting of net 
valuation adjustments of investments in affiliated companies, write-downs and non-scheduled depreciation of tangible and 
intangible assets and expenses from loss take-over.  

Net  valuation  adjustments  and  net  results  from  disposals  of  investments  in  affiliated  companies  amounted  to  negative 
€ 740 million (2022: positive € 4.2 billion), mainly relating to various banking subsidiaries in Europe.

Taxes 

In 2023, the bank recorded a tax benefit of € 646 million compared to a tax benefit of € 1.8 billion in the prior year. The current 
year’s tax benefit was mainly driven by changes in the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets.  

Net profit and proposed appropriation 

Deutsche Bank AG recorded a net profit of € 5.0 billion in 2023, compared to a net profit of € 5.5 billion in 2022. 

After  an  addition  to  revenue  reserves  of  € 2.0 billion,  the  2023  distributable  profit  amounted  to  € 3.5 billion.  The  Bank  will 
propose  to  the  Annual  General  Meeting  a  dividend  of  € 0.45  per  share.  This  will  reduce  the  distributable  profit  by  up  to 
€ 918 million,  depending  on  the  number  of  shares  outstanding  at  the  record  date.  It  will  also  be  proposed  to  appropriate 
additional € 2.0 billion to revenue reserves and to carry forward the remaining distributable profit.

Total  assets  of  Deutsche  Bank  AG  amounted  to  € 1,060 billion  as  of  December 31, 2023.  The  1%  increase  compared  to 
December 31, 2022, was mainly driven by increases in Trading Assets. The net growth was mainly funded by higher Trading 
Liabilities.  

Total credit extended 

Total credit extended (excluding reverse repos and securities spot deals) decreased by € 7.0 billion (1%), to € 474.9 billion. 
This development was primarily driven by a decrease in Claims on customers by  € 21.3 billion (5%) to € 412.7 billion and 
partly  offset  by  an  increase  in  Loans  to  banks,  which  are  reported  under  total  credit  extended,  by  € 14.4 billion  (30%)  to 
€ 62.2 billion.

1  Including those repayable on demand and those with an indefinite period 

Receivables  from  banks  (excluding  loans)  outside  trading  decreased  by  € 11.9 billion  to  € 113.2 billion  compared  to 
December 31, 2022. 

Investments in affiliated companies 

Investments in affiliated companies decreased by € 1.5 billion to € 29.3 billion; this decrease was attributable to write-downs 
(€ 0.9 billion), capital repayments (€ 0.8 billion), the merger of an affiliated company into Deutsche Bank AG (€ 0.4 billion), 
and  a  negative  impact  of  foreign  currency  translation  (€ 0.3 billion),  partly  offset  by  purchases  of  affiliated  companies 
(€ 0.5 billion) and capital increases (€ 0.4 billion). 

Securities 

The  bank’s  securities  portfolio  (excluding  trading  assets)  increased  by  € 0.8 billion  to  € 71.7 billion,  mainly  driven  by  an 
increase in bonds. 

Trading assets 

Trading  assets amounted  to  € 247.6 billion,  an  increase  of  € 12.9 billion  (6%)  compared  to  December 31,  2022.  This  was 
mainly driven by an increase in securities qualifying as trading, which grew by € 31.4 billion (49%) to € 95.9 billion, as well by 
an increase of receivables qualifying as trading, higher by € 2.9 billion (4%) to € 76.2 billion, partly offset by a decrease of 
€ 21.8 billion (23%) to € 74.5 billion in positive market values from trading derivatives. 

Deposits and securitized liabilities 

Liabilities to banks decreased slightly and amounted to € 145.2 billion for 2023, while liabilities to customers remained almost 
stable  at  to  € 517.7 billion,  lower  by  € 7.6 billion  (1%)  compared  to  December  31,  2022.  Within  this  item,  the  composition 
changed. Other liabilities repayable on demand decreased by € 40.6 billion (12%) from € 345.0 billion to € 304.4 billion. This 
was partly offset by an increase in savings deposits by € 4.6 billion (8%) from € 59.6 billion to € 64.3 billion and by an increase 
in other liabilities with agreed period or notice period by € 28.4 billion from € 120.6 billion to € 149.0 billion. 

Liabilities in certificate from amounted to € 92.1 billion, up € 5.0 billion (6%) in comparison to December 31, 2022. The increase 
was partly driven by an increase of bonds and notes issued by € 1.7 billion (2%) compared to December 31, 2022, and other 
liabilities in certificate form by € 3.3 billion (102%) to € 6.5 billion.

Deutsche Bank AG Performance 

Trading liabilities 

Trading liabilities amounted to € 191.3 billion, an increase of € 12.9 billion (7%) in comparison to December 31, 2022. This 
was mainly driven by increases in other liabilities qualifying as trading by € 34.1 billion (61%) to € 89.7 billion partly offset by 
a  decrease  of  € 16.2 billion  (19%)  in  negative  market  values  from  trading  derivatives  to  € 68.8 billion  and  a  decrease  in 
securities (short positions) of € 4.9 billion (13%) to € 32.8 billion.  

Provisions 

Provisions amounted to € 7.1 billion, down € 0.4 billion (5%) compared to December 31, 2022. An increase of provisions for 
taxes by € 0.2 billion (38%) was more than offset by a decrease in provisions for pensions and similar obligation by € 0.3 billion 
(11%) and of other provisions by € 0.3 billion (6%).  

Instruments for additional tier 1 regulatory capital 

Instruments for additional Tier 1 Regulatory Capital amounted to € 8.9 billion compared to € 9.0 billion last year. The year-on-
year movement is the result of currency translation effects. 

Capital and reserves 

Capital and reserves of Deutsche Bank AG amounted to € 43.5 billion. The increase of € 3.9 billion is mainly attributable to 
the distributable profit generated in 2023 as well as an increase in other revenue reserves. 

Consistent with prior years, the Bank has utilized the option available under Section 2a of the German Banking Act (KWG) 
with respect to its regulatory capital and presents capital requirements for Deutsche Bank Group only. 

In summary: The bank maintained its stable funding, high liquidity base and solid regulatory capital position which is based 
on Group capital. For further details, please refer to the liquidity risk and capital adequacy sections in the Risk Report.

Annual Report 2023 

Standalone parent company information (HGB) 
Management of Deutsche Bank AG within the Group 

Management of Deutsche Bank AG within the Group  

The content in this chapter should be read in conjunction with the respective group sections in this Annual Report, especially 
“Risk Report”, “Outlook”, “Risks and Opportunities” and “Internal control over financial reporting”. 

Risk Management 

The impact of the risks on Deutsche Bank AG cannot be isolated from the effects on Deutsche Bank’s other legal entities, 
mainly driven by: 

–  The Group’s management structure, including its corporate divisions follows its customers’ needs. The legal structure is 
determined by local legislation and therefore does not necessarily follow the management structure. For example, local 
legislation can determine whether the Group’s business in a certain country is conducted by a branch of Deutsche Bank 
AG or by a separate subsidiary. However, the management has to monitor the risks in the bank’s business – irrespective 
of whether it is transacted by a branch or a subsidiary. 

–  Adequate risk monitoring and management requires knowledge of the extent to which the Group’s profit situation depends 
on the development of certain risk factors, i.e., on the creditworthiness of individual customers or securities issuers or on 
movements in market prices. The respective exposures therefore need to be analyzed across legal entities. Especially for 
the credit risk attached to a borrower, as it is irrelevant whether the credit exposure to a company is spread over several 
Group companies or concentrated on Deutsche Bank AG. Separate monitoring of the risk affecting Deutsche Bank AG 
alone would neglect the potential exposure facing the Group and, indirectly, Deutsche Bank AG – as the parent – if the 
company became insolvent. 

–  Individual risk factors are sometimes correlated, and in some cases, they are independent of each other. If estimates of 
the nature and extent of this correlation are available, the Group’s management can significantly reduce the overall risk by 
diversifying its businesses across customer groups, issuers and countries. The risk correlation is also independent of the 
Group’s legal and divisional structure. Therefore, management can only optimize the risk-mitigating effects of diversification 
if it manages them Group-wide and across legal entities. 

For the reasons mentioned, the identification, monitoring and management of all risks in Deutsche Bank AG are integrated 
into the Group-wide risk management process. Following Group policies, Deutsche Bank AG adheres to the respective legal 
and regulatory requirements. 

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of Deutsche Bank AG stands at 127.5% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 130.8% as 
of December 31, 2022. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) amounts to 110.1% as of December 31, 2023, compared to 108.7% 
as of December 31, 2022. Both ratios are calculated separately to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity and stable funding at 
Deutsche Bank AG. 

Outlook and Strategy 

Deutsche Bank AG as the parent company of the Group defines the strategy and planning for the individual Group Divisions. 
Deutsche  Bank  AG  participates  in  the  results  of  the  Group  Divisions  through  own  activities  and  profit  distribution  from 
subsidiaries. Therefore, the Group’s outlook encompasses all Group Divisions and is not limited to the parent company. In 
addition, financial key performance indicators are solely defined on Group level, except for the amount of distributable profit.

Non-financial Statement for Deutsche Bank AG 

Risks and Opportunities 

Risks 

Deutsche  Bank  AG  as  a  solo  entity  reporting  under  HGB  faces  additional  risks  compared  to  the  Group  in  that  certain 
transactions in a given year may lead to higher or lower losses than in the Group financial statements prepared under IFRS. 
The following items carry significant risk in this respect: 

–  Potential valuation adjustments of investments in affiliated companies, driven by local political and economic environment, 

increased local regulatory requirements, restructuring or changes of share prices of listed investments. 

–  Increase  in  long-term  provisions,  especially  pension  obligations,  despite  rises  in  interest  rate  levels  caused  by  the 

discounting with average interest rates according to Section 253 (2) German Commercial Code. 

–  Negative valuation adjustments to plan assets, especially in an environment of rising interest rate levels. Due to the above-
mentioned valuation methodology, there might be no offsetting effect from lower pension obligations if interest rates are 
rising. 

–  Potential requirement to set up a provision according to German accounting pronouncement IDW RS BFA 3 in case the 
interest-bearing  banking  book  does  not  generate  an  interest  margin  sufficient  to  cover  expected  credit  risk  costs  and 
administrative expenses. A persisting low interest rate environment and the treatment of coupon payments related to the 
AT1 instruments as expenses under HGB increase this risk. 

In addition, profits or retained earnings from affiliated companies might not allow for sufficient dividend payments to Deutsche 
Bank AG to facilitate dividend payments by Deutsche Bank AG as targeted. 

Opportunities 

Deutsche Bank AG as a solo entity reporting under HGB may have additional opportunities compared to the Group in that 
respect that certain transactions in a given year are reported in a more beneficial manner than for the Group under IFRS, such 
as realized gains which may be recognized in the income statement under IFRS in an earlier period. 

In addition, there is the possibility that Deutsche Bank AG as parent entity shows profits in a given year that are higher than 
its contribution to the Group’s net income, resulting from increased profit distributions from affiliated companies. 

Internal control over financial reporting 

The controls that are performed for the Group’s Annual Statements under IFRS apply to the bank’s financial statements under 
HGB accordingly. In addition to these controls, specific HGB related controls are implemented which include: 

–  Inter-branch reconciliation and elimination are performed for HGB specific balances; and,  
–  Analytical reviews of revaluation and reclassification items between IFRS and HGB on the level of foreign branches and 

the German headquarters.

Basis of accounting 

Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Taunusanlage 12, 60325 Frankfurt am Main, Germany (“Deutsche Bank” or the “Parent”) 
is a stock corporation organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. Deutsche Bank together with all entities 
in which Deutsche Bank has a controlling financial interest (collectively the “Group”, or “Deutsche Bank”) is a global provider 
of a full range of corporate and investment banking, private clients and asset management products and services. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are stated in euros, the presentation currency of the Group. All financial 
information presented in million euros has been rounded to the nearest million. The consolidated financial statements have 
been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (“IFRS”)  as  issued  by  the  International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and endorsed by the European Union (EU). 

Prior to publication on March 14, 2024, the Supervisory Board approved the Consolidated Financial Statements 2023 of the 
Group on March 13, 2024, which were drawn up by the Management Board on March 7, 2024. 

EU carve-out 

The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (fair value macro hedges) in accordance 
with the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. The purpose of applying the EU carve-out version of IAS 39 is to align the Group’s 
hedge accounting approach with its risk management practice and the accounting practice of its major European peers. Under 
the  EU  carve-out  version  of  IAS  39,  fair  value  macro  hedge  accounting  may  be  applied  to  core  deposits  and  hedge 
ineffectiveness is generally only recognized when the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets 
falls below the original designated amount of that bucket. If the revised amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is 
more than the original designated amount then there is no hedge ineffectiveness. Under IFRS as issued by the IASB, hedge 
accounting for fair value macro hedges cannot be applied to core deposits. In addition, under IFRS as issued by the IASB 
hedge ineffectiveness arises for all fair value macro hedge accounting relationships whenever the revised estimate of the 
amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is either more or less than the original designated amount of that bucket. The 
EU  carve  out  version  of  IAS  39  also  removes  the  prohibition  on  identifying  a  benchmark  risk  component  in  a  financial 
instrument  priced  at  sub–benchmark.  This  may  arise  when  financial  instruments  carry  a  negative  spread  such  that  the 
identified non–contractually specified risk component is larger than the interest carry on the contract itself. 

For the financial year ended December 31, 2023, the application of the EU carve-out version of IAS 39 had a negative impact 
of € 2.3 billion on profit before tax and of € 1.6 billion on profit after tax. For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, the 
application of the EU carve-out had a positive impact of € 147 million on profit before taxes and of € 105 million on profit post 
taxes.  

The Group’s regulatory capital and ratios thereof are also reported on the basis of the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. The 
impact on total equity also impacts the calculation of the CET1 capital ratio. For the financial year ended December 31, 2023, 
application of the EU carve-out had a negative impact on the CET1 capital ratio of about 43 basis points and a positive impact 
of about 5 basis points for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. 

IFRS 7 disclosures (including war in Ukraine and climate risk related disclosures)  

Disclosures on risks related to the macroeconomic environment can be found in the sections in “IFRS 9 Impairment”, line item 
“Focus areas in 2023” in the Risk Report, Note 35 “Derivatives”, section “Derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting”, Note 13 
“Financial  Instruments  carried  at  Fair  Value”,  sections  “Valuations  techniques”  and  “Sensitivity  analysis  of  unobservable 
parameters” as well as Note 14” Fair Value of Financial Instruments not carried at Fair Value”. 

Disclosures  about  the  nature  and  the  extent  of  risks  arising  from  financial  instruments  as  required  by  IFRS  7,  “Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures” are set forth in the Risk Report section of the Combined Management Report and are an integral 
part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Details on exposures and the impact on financial instrument impairment from the war in Ukraine can be found in the sections, 
“IFRS  9  impairment”  and  “Exposure  to  Russia”  in  the  Risk  Report.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  Group  discontinued  its 
disclosure  relating  to  Market  Risk  to  Russia,  Russian  operations  and  Compliance  and  Anti  Financial  Crime  risks.  This 
considers the de-risking efforts the Group has undertaken. The Group continues to monitor its risks related to  Russia and 
Ukraine as part of its regular risk management activities and enhanced governance oversight in place. 

Disclosures on climate related risk can be found in the sections, “Enterprise Risk Management”, line item “Environmental, 
social and governance risk” in the Risk Report. The Group is exposed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk. 
The following are examples of how such risk may impact the financial results of the Group: 

–  Increases  in  the  frequency  and  severity  of  climate  events  could  impact  client  ability  to  service  principal  and  interest 

payments under instruments subject to IFRS 9. 

–  Failure  to  comply  with  environmental  and  social  legislation  may  impact  client  ability  to  generate  sustainable  returns  to 

service their loans. 

–  If in the future clients do not hold sufficient insurance for physical assets against certain risks (e.g., flooding), this may 

impact the value of collateral held against certain type of loans. 

The Group considers such ESG risk as part of the credit risk assessment and due diligence process before relevant clients 
are  granted  credit.  The  Group  also  manages  its  credit  portfolio  within  the  established  risk  appetite  and  limits.  Further 
accounting considerations, including risk consideration, for ESG indexed loans can be found in the section “Financial assets” 
in the description of the material accounting policies below. 

These audited disclosures are marked in light blue in the Risk Report. 

Critical accounting estimates 

The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions for certain 
categories of assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates. The Group’s material accounting policies 
are described in “Material Accounting Policies”. 

Certain of the Group’s accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments 
and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such 
critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and may have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates 
where management could have reasonably used another estimate in the current accounting period. The Group has identified 
the following material accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates: 

–  Impairment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (see “Impairment of Loans and Provision 

for Off-balance Sheet Positions” below)  

–  Determination of fair value (see “Determination of Fair Value” below) 
–  Recognition of trade date profit (see “Recognition of Trade Date Profit” below) 
–  Impairment of loans and provisions for off-balance sheet positions (see “Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-balance 

Sheet Positions” below)  

–  Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles (see “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” below) 
–  Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets (see “Income Taxes” below) 
–  Accounting for legal and regulatory contingencies and uncertain tax positions (see “Provisions” below) 

Material accounting policies 

The following is a description of the matrial accounting policies of the Group. Except for the changes in accounting policies 
and changes in accounting estimates described previously and noted below these policies have been consistently applied for 
2021, 2022 and 2023.

Principles of consolidation  

The financial information in the Consolidated Financial Statements includes the parent company, Deutsche Bank AG, together 
with its consolidated subsidiaries, including certain structured entities presented as a single economic unit. 

Subsidiaries 

The Group’s subsidiaries are those entities which it directly or indirectly controls. Control over an entity is evidenced by the 
Group’s ability to exercise its power in order to affect any variable returns that the Group is exposed to through its involvement 
with the entity.  

The Group sponsors the formation of structured entities and interacts with structured entities sponsored by third parties for a 
variety of reasons, including allowing clients to hold investments in separate legal entities, allowing clients to invest jointly in 
alternative assets, for asset securitization transactions, and for buying or selling credit protection. 

When assessing whether to consolidate an entity, the Group evaluates a range of control factors, namely: 

–  Purpose and design of the entity 
–  Relevant activities and how these are determined 
–  Whether the Group’s rights result in the ability to direct the relevant activities 
–  Whether the Group has exposure or rights to variable returns  
–  Whether the Group has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns  

Where voting rights are relevant, the Group is deemed to have control where it holds, directly or indirectly, more than half of 
the voting rights over an entity unless there is evidence that another investor has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the 
relevant activities.  

Potential voting rights that are deemed to be substantive are also considered when assessing control.  

Likewise, the Group also assesses existence of control where it does not control the majority of the voting power but has the 
practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities. This may arise in circumstances where the size and dispersion of 
holdings of the shareholders give the Group the power to direct the activities of the investee. 

Associates  

Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. An associate is an entity in which the 
Group has significant influence, but not a controlling interest, over the operating and financial management policy decisions 
of the entity. Significant influence is generally presumed when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. 
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing 
whether the Group has significant influence. Among the other factors that are considered in determining whether the Group 
has  significant  influence  are  representation  on  the  board  of  directors  (supervisory  board  in  the  case  of  German  stock 
corporations) and material intercompany transactions. The existence of these factors could require the application of the equity 
method of accounting for a particular investment even though the Group’s investment is less than 20% of the voting stock. 

Under  the  equity  method  of  accounting,  the  Group’s  investments  in  associates  and  jointly  controlled  entities  are  initially 
recorded  at  cost  including  any  directly  related  transaction  costs  incurred  in  acquiring  the  associate,  and  subsequently 
increased (or decreased) to reflect both the Group’s pro-rata share of the post-acquisition net income (or loss) of the associate 
or jointly controlled entity and other movements included directly in the equity of the associate or jointly controlled entity. The 
Group’s share of the results of associates is adjusted to conform to the accounting policies of the Group and is reported in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income as Net income (loss) from equity method investments. 

If  there  is  objective  evidence  of  impairment,  an  impairment  test  is  performed  by  comparing  the  investment’s  recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell, with its carrying amount.

Foreign currency translation  

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro, which is the presentation currency of the Group. Various entities 
in the Group use a different functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates. 

An entity records foreign currency revenues, expenses, gains and losses in its functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of recognition. 

Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  entity’s  functional  currency  are  translated  at  the 
period end closing rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation and settlement of these items are 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income as net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through 
profit  or  loss  in  order  to  align  the  translation  amounts  with  those  recognized  from  foreign  currency  related  transactions 
(derivatives) which hedge these monetary assets and liabilities. 

Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost are translated using the historical exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. Translation differences on non-monetary items which are held at fair value through profit or loss are recognized 
in profit or loss.  

For purposes of translation into  the presentation currency, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the 
period end closing rate and items of income and expense are translated into euros at the rates prevailing on the dates of the 
transactions, or average rates of exchange where these approximate actual rates. The exchange differences arising on the 
translation of a foreign operation are included in other comprehensive income. For foreign operations that are subsidiaries, 
the amount of exchange differences attributable to any noncontrolling interests is recognized in noncontrolling interests. 

Upon disposal of a foreign subsidiary and associate (which results in loss of control or significant influence over that operation) 
the total cumulative exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. 

Upon partial disposal of a foreign operation that is a subsidiary and which does not result in loss of control, the proportionate 
share of cumulative exchange differences is reclassified from other comprehensive income to noncontrolling interests as this 
is deemed a transaction with equity holders. For a partial disposal of an associate which does not result in a loss of significant 
influence, the proportionate share of cumulative exchange differences is reclassified from other comprehensive income to 
profit or loss. 

Interest, commissions and fees  

Net interest income – Interest income and expense from all interest-bearing assets and liabilities is recognized as net interest 
income using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate (EIR) is a method of calculating the amortized cost 
of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant period using the 
estimated future cash flows. 

The estimated future cash flows used in the EIR calculation include those determined by all of the contractual terms of the 
asset or liability, all fees (including commissions) that are considered to be integral to the effective interest rate, direct and 
incremental transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. However, if the financial instrument is carried at fair value 
through  profit  or  loss,  any  associated  fees  are  recognized  in  trading  income  when  the  instrument  is  initially  recognized, 
provided there are no significant unobservable inputs used in determining its fair value.  

If a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost 
amount. The amortized cost amount of a financial asset is the gross carrying amount of a financial asset after adjusting for 
any  impairment  allowance.  For  assets  which  are  initially  recognized  as  purchased  or  credit-impaired,  interest  revenue  is 
calculated through the use of a credit-adjusted effective interest rate which takes into consideration expected credit losses.  

The Group presents negative interest paid on interest-bearing assets as interest expense, and interest revenue received from 
interest-bearing liabilities as interest income.

Annual Report 2023 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

The Group presents interest income and expense calculated using the EIR method separately in the Group’s consolidated 
statement of income. 

Commissions and fee income –The Group applies the IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” five-step revenue 
recognition model to the recognition of Commissions and Fee Income, under which income must be recognized when control 
of goods and services is transferred, hence the contractual performance obligations to the customer has been satisfied.  

Accordingly, after a contract with a customer has been identified in the first step, the second step is to identify the performance 
obligation – or a series of distinct performance obligations – provided to the customer. The Group must examine whether the 
service is capable of being distinct and is actually distinct within the context of the contract. A promised service is distinct if 
the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the 
customer, and the promise to transfer the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. 
The amount of income is measured on the basis of the contractually agreed transaction price for the performance obligation 
defined in the contract. If a contract includes a variable consideration, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to 
which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. Income is recognized in 
profit and loss when the identified performance obligation has been satisfied. The Group does not present information about 
its remaining performance obligations if it is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.  

The Group determines the stand-alone selling price at contract inception of a distinct service underlying each performance 
obligation in the contract and allocates the transaction price in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone 
selling price is the price at which DB would sell a promised service separately to a customer on an unbundled basis. The best 
evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a service when the Group sells that service separately in 
similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the Group does not sell the service to a customer separately, it estimates 
the stand-alone selling price at an amount using a suitable method, for example, in loan syndication transactions the Group 
applies the requirements for recognition of trade day profit and considers the price at which other market participants provide 
the  same  service  on  an  unbundled  basis.  As  such  when  estimating  a  stand-alone  selling  price,  the  Group  considers  all 
information  (including  market  conditions)  that  is  reasonably  available  to  it.  In  doing  so,  the  Group  maximizes  the  use  of 
observable inputs and applies estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances. 

The Group provides asset management services that give rise to asset management and performance fees and constitute a 
single performance obligation. The asset management and performance fee components are variable considerations such 
that at each reporting date the Group estimates the fee amount to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the 
promised services to the customer. The benefits arising from the asset management services are simultaneously received 
and  consumed  by  the  customer  over  time.  The  Group  recognizes  revenue  over  time  by  measuring  the  progress  towards 
complete  satisfaction  of  that  performance  obligation,  subject  to  the  removal  of  any  uncertainty  as  to  whether  it  is  highly 
probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not. For the management 
fee component this is the end of the monthly or quarterly service period. For performance fees this date is when any uncertainty 
related to the performance component has been fully removed. 

Loan commitment fees related to commitments that are accounted for off balance sheet are recognized in commissions and 
fee income over the life of the commitment if it is unlikely that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement. If it is 
probable that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement, the loan commitment fee is deferred until the origination 
of a loan and recognized as an adjustment to the loan’s effective interest rate. 

Commissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from services that are received and consumed by the customer over 
time: Administration, assets under management, foreign commercial business, loan processing and guarantees sundry other 
customer services. The Group recognizes revenue from these services over time by measuring the progress towards complete 
satisfaction of that performance obligation, subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a 
significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not.  

Commissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from providing services at a point in time or transaction-type services 
include: other securities, underwriting and advisory fees, brokerage fees, local payments, foreign currency/ exchange business 
and intermediary fees.  

Expenses that are directly related and incremental to the generation of Commissions and Fee Income are presented net in 
Commissions and Fee Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This includes income and associated expense where 
the  Group  contractually  owns  the  performance  obligation  (i.e.  as  Principal)  in  relation  to  the  service  that  gives  rise  to  the 
revenue and associated expense. In contrast, it does not include situations where the Group does not contractually own the 
performance obligation and is acting as agent. The determination of whether the Group is acting as principal or agent is based 
on  the  contractual  terms  of  the  underlying  service  arrangement.  The  gross  Commissions  and  Fee  Income  and  Expense 
amounts are disclosed in “Note 6 – Commissions and Fee Income”.

Financial assets 

The Group classifies financial assets in line with the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9, where financial 
assets are classified based on both the business model used for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the financial asset (known as Solely Payments of Principal and Interest or “SPPI”). There are three business 
models available: 

–  Hold to Collect - Financial assets held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows. They are subsequently measured 

at amortized cost and are recorded in multiple lines on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. 

–  Hold  to  Collect  and  Sell  -  Financial  assets  held  with  the  objective  of  both  collecting  contractual  cash  flows  and  selling 
financial assets. They are recorded as Financial assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income on the Group’s 
consolidated balance sheet. 

–  Other  -  Financial  assets that do  not meet  the  criteria  of  either  “Hold  to  Collect” or “Hold  to  Collect  and  Sell”.  They  are 

recorded as Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. 

The assessment of business model requires judgment based on facts and circumstances upon initial recognition. As part of 
this assessment, the Group considers quantitative factors (e.g., the expected frequency and volume of sales) and qualitative 
factors such  as  how  the  performance  of  the  business  model  and  the  financial  assets held within  that business  model  are 
evaluated and reported to the Group’s key management personnel. In addition to taking into consideration the risks that affect 
the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model, in particular, the way in which 
those  market  and  credit  risks  are  managed;  and  how  managers  of  the  business  are  compensated  (e.g.,  whether  the 
compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected). This assessment 
results in an asset being classified in either a Hold to Collect, Hold to Collect and Sell or Other business model.  

If the Group holds a financial asset either in a Hold to Collect or a Hold to Collect and Sell business model, then an assessment 
at initial recognition to determine whether the contractual cash flows of the financial asset are Solely Payments of Principal 
and Interest on the principal amount outstanding is required to determine the financial asset classification. Contractual cash 
flows, that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding, are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Interest in a basic 
lending arrangement is consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk associated with the principal amount 
outstanding during a particular period of time. It can also include consideration for other basic lending risks (e.g., liquidity risk) 
and costs (e.g., administrative costs) associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time; and a profit 
margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where cash flows can change over time due to contingent events, 
such as terms where the margin on a loan adjusts depending on the performance of the borrower on certain contractual ESG 
metrics, the contingent event and cash flows are assessed to determine if the instrument cash flows are SPPI. The nature of 
the  contingent  event  and  the  size  of  the  possible  change  in  cash  flows  are  taken  into  account  in  this  assessment  on  an 
absolute and relative basis compared to the overall coupon. Additionally, as part of the SPPI assessment where the lending 
is non-recourse in nature then further assessment is made to determine if the cash flows are consistent with SPPI which is 
dependent on the nature of the underlying, the level of subordination and the contractual cash flows of the instrument held. 
The Group originates and purchases debt instruments from entities issuing multiple tranches of debt. Where these instruments 
meet the definition of a contractually linked instruments then further analysis is performed on the cash flows and credit risk 
exposure of the instrument held as well as the underlying collateral held at purchase and can be held in the future. 

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 

Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss if they are held in the Other business model because they 
are either held for trading or because they do not meet the criteria for Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell. In addition, 
it includes financial assets that meet the criteria for Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business model, but the financial 
asset fails SPPI or where the Group designated the financial assets under the fair value option. 

Financial assets classified as Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with realized and 
unrealized gains and losses included in Net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
Interest on interest earning assets such as trading loans and debt securities and dividends on equity instruments are presented 
in Interest and Similar Income.  

The Group applies trade date accounting to financial assets classified at fair value through profit or loss. 

Trading assets – Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they have been originated, acquired or incurred principally 
for the purpose of selling or repurchasing them in the near term, or they form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments 
that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Trading assets 
include  debt  and  equity  securities,  derivatives  held  for  trading  purposes,  and  trading  loans.  This  also  includes  loan 
commitments that are allocated to the Other business model and that are presented as derivatives held for trading.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit and loss  –The Group assigns any non-trading financial 
asset that does not fall into the Hold to Collect nor Hold to Collect and Sell business models into the Other business model 
and  classifies  them  as  Non-Trading  Financial  Assets  mandatory  at  Fair  Value  through  Profit  and  Loss.  This  includes 
predominately reverse repurchase agreements which are managed on a fair value basis. Additionally, any financial asset that 
falls into the Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business models for which the contractual cash flow characteristics 
are not SPPI is classified by the Group as Non-Trading Financial Assets Mandatory at Fair Value through Profit and Loss. 

Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss – Certain financial assets that would otherwise be measured 
subsequently at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, may be designated at Fair Value through 
Profit or Loss if the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency. The Group 
allows the fair value option to be designated only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can 
be obtained. 

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 

A  financial  asset  shall  be  classified  and  measured  at  Fair  Value  through  Other  Comprehensive  Income  (“FVOCI”),  if  the 
financial asset is held in a Hold to Collect and Sell business model and the contractual cash flows are SPPI, unless designated 
under the fair value option.  

The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recorded in net interest income. Realized gains and losses are 
reported in net gains (losses) on financial assets at FVOCI. Generally, the weighted-average cost method is used to determine 
the cost of FVOCI financial assets. 

The Group applies trade date accounting to financial assets classified at FVOCI. 

It is possible to designate non-trading equity instruments as FVOCI. However, this category is expected to have limited usage 
by the Group and has not been used to date. 

Financial assets at amortized cost 

A financial asset is classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost if the financial asset is held in a Hold to Collect 
business model and the contractual cash flows are SPPI.  

Under this measurement category, the financial asset is measured at fair value at initial recognition. Subsequently the carrying 
amount is reduced for principal payments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method. The 
financial  asset  is  assessed  for  impairment  under  the  IFRS 9  expected  credit  loss  model  where  provisions  are  recognized 
based on expectations of potential credit losses. The Group’s impairment of financial instruments policy is described further 
in the section “Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet Positions (IFRS 9)”. The Group applies settlement 
date accounting to financial assets measured at amortized cost. 

Financial Assets at amortized cost include predominately Loans at amortized cost, Central bank funds sold and securities 
purchased under resale agreements, Securities borrowed and certain receivables presented in Other Assets. 

Modification of financial assets and financial liabilities 

When the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, a gain 
or loss is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified 
cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. The modified financial asset will continue to accrued interest at its 
original EIR. When a modification results in derecognition the original instrument is derecognized and the new instrument 
recognized at fair value. 

Non-credit related or commercial renegotiations where an obligor has not experienced a significant increase in credit risk since 
origination, and has a readily exercisable right to early terminate the financial asset results in derecognition of the original 
agreement and recognition of a new financial asset based on the newly negotiated commercial terms.  

For credit related modifications (i.e. those modifications due to significant increase in credit risk since inception) or those where 
the obligor does not have the readily exercisable right to early terminate, the Group assesses whether the modified terms 
result in the financial asset being significantly modified and therefore derecognized. This assessment includes a quantitative 
assessment  of  the  impact  of  the  change  in  cash  flows  from  the  modification  of  contractual  terms  and  additionally,  where 
necessary, a qualitative assessment of the impact of the change in the contractual terms. Where these modifications are not 
concluded to be significant, the financial asset is not derecognized and is accounted for as a modification as described above.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

If  the  changes  are  concluded  to  be  significant,  the  old  instrument is  derecognized  and  a  new  instrument recognized. The 
Group then recognizes a credit loss allowance based on 12-month expected credit losses. However, if following a modification 
that results in a derecognition of the original financial asset, there is evidence that the new financial asset is credit-impaired 
on initial recognition; then the new financial asset should be recognized as an originated credit-impaired financial asset and 
initially classified in Stage 3 (refer to section “Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet Positions” below). 

When the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated or modified then the Group assesses whether the modified terms result 
in  the  financial  liability  being  significantly  modified  and  therefore  derecognized.  This  assessment  includes  a  quantitative 
assessment  of  the  impact  of  the  change  in  cash  flows  from  the  modification  of  contractual  terms  and  additionally,  where 
necessary, a qualitative assessment of the impact of the change in the contractual terms. Where these modifications are not 
concluded to be significant, the financial liability is not derecognized and a gain or loss is recognized in the income statement 
as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. Where there is derecognition the original financial liability is derecognized and the new liability recognized at its 
fair value. 

Loan commitments 

Loan commitments remain off-balance sheet, unless allocated to the Other business model and presented as derivatives held 
for trading. The Group does not recognize and measure changes in fair value of off-balance sheet loan commitments that 
result from changes in market interest rates or credit spreads. However, as specified in the sections “Impairment of Loans and 
Provision  for  Off-Balance  Sheet  Positions”  below,  these  off-balance  sheet  loan  commitments  are  in  scope  of  the  IFRS 9 
impairment model. 

Financial liabilities 

Under  IFRS 9  financial  liabilities  are  measured  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method,  except  for  financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.  

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include Trading Liabilities, Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value 
through Profit or Loss and Non-Participating Investment Contracts (“Investment Contracts”). Under IFRS 9 they are carried at 
fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss. For financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss the fair value movements 
attributable to the Group’s own credit component for fair value movements is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. 

The Group applies trade date accounting to financial liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss. 

Interest on interest paying liabilities are presented in interest expense for financial instruments at fair value through profit or 
loss. 

Trading liabilities - Financial liabilities that arise from debt issued are classified as held for trading if they have been originated 
or incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing them in the near term. Trading liabilities consist primarily of derivative 
liabilities (including certain loan commitments) and short positions. This also includes loan commitments where the resulting 
loan upon funding is allocated to the other business model such that the undrawn loan commitment is classified as derivatives 
held for trading. 

Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss - Certain financial liabilities that do not meet the definition of 
trading liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option. To be designated at fair value 
through profit or loss, financial liabilities must meet one of the following criteria: (1) the designation eliminates or significantly 
reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency; (2) a group of financial liabilities is managed and its performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy; or (3) the instrument 
contains one or more embedded derivatives unless: (a) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows 
that otherwise would be required by the contract; or (b) it is clear with little or no analysis that separation is prohibited. In 
addition,  the  Group  allows  the  fair  value  option  to  be  designated  only  for  those  financial  instruments  for  which  a  reliable 
estimate of fair value can be obtained. Financial liabilities which are designated at fair value through profit or loss, under the 
fair value option, include repurchase agreements, loan commitments and structured note liabilities.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

Investment contracts - All of the Group’s investment contracts are unit-linked contracts that match specific assets held by the 
Group.  The  contracts  oblige  the  Group  to  use  these  assets  to  settle  investment  contract  liabilities.  They  do  not  contain 
significant insurance risk or discretionary participation features. The contract liabilities are determined using current unit prices 
multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders as of the balance sheet date. As this amount represents 
fair value, the liabilities have been classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Deposits collected under 
investment contracts are accounted for as an adjustment to the investment contract liabilities. Investment income attributable 
to investment contracts is included in the consolidated statement of Income. Investment contract claims reflect the excess of 
amounts paid over the account balance released. Investment contract policyholders are charged fees for policy administration, 
investment management, surrenders or other contract services.  

Embedded derivatives 

Some hybrid financial liability contracts contain both a derivative and a non-derivative component. In such cases, the derivative 
component  is  termed  an  embedded  derivative,  with  the  non-derivative  component  representing  the  host  financial  liability 
contract. If the economic characteristics and risks of embedded derivatives are not closely related to those of the host financial 
liability contract and the hybrid financial liability contract itself is not carried at fair value through profit or loss, the embedded 
derivative  is  bifurcated  and  reported  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and  losses  recognized  in  net  gains  (losses)  on  financial 
assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  The  host  financial  liability  contract  will  continue  to  be  accounted  for  in 
accordance with the appropriate accounting standard. The carrying amount of an embedded derivative is reported in the same 
Consolidated balance sheet line item as the host financial liability contract. Certain hybrid financial liability instruments have 
been designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option.  

Financial liabilities at amortized cost 

Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include long-term and short-term debt issued which are initially measured at 
fair value, which is the consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred. Repurchases of issued debt in the market are 
treated as extinguishments and any related gain or loss is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. A subsequent 
sale of own bonds in the market is treated as a reissuance of debt. The Group applies settlement date accounting to financial 
liabilities measured at amortized cost. 

Offsetting of financial instruments  

Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amount presented in the Consolidated balance sheet, only if the Group 
holds a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or 
to realize an asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legal right to set off the recognized amounts must be enforceable 
in  both  the  normal  course  of  business  and  in  the  event  of  default,  insolvency  or  bankruptcy  of  both  the  Group  and  its 
counterparty. In all other situations they are presented gross. When financial assets and financial liabilities are offset in the 
Consolidated balance sheet, the associated income and expense items will also be offset in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income, unless specifically prohibited by an applicable accounting standard. 

The majority of the offsetting applied by the Group relates to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. For further 
information please refer to Note 17 “Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. 

Determination of fair value  

Fair  value  is  defined  as  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  arm’s  length 
transaction  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date.  The  fair  value  of  instruments  that are  quoted in  active 
markets  is  determined  using  the  quoted  prices  where  they  represent  those  at  which  regularly  and  recently  occurring 
transactions take place.  

The Group measures certain portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of their net risk exposures when 
the following criteria are met: 

–  The group of financial assets and liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to a particular market risk (or risks) 

or to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, in accordance with a documented risk management strategy, 

–  The fair values are provided to key management personnel, and 
–  The financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss. 

This portfolio valuation approach is consistent with how the Group manages its net exposures to market and counterparty 
credit risks.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

Critical accounting estimates – The Group uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of instruments where prices 
quoted in active markets are not available. Therefore, where possible, parameter inputs to the valuation techniques are based 
on observable data derived from prices of relevant instruments traded in an active market. These valuation techniques involve 
some  level  of  management  estimation  and  judgment,  the  degree  of  which  will  depend  on  the  price  transparency  for  the 
instrument or market and the instrument’s complexity.  

In reaching estimates of fair value management judgment needs to be exercised. The areas requiring significant management 
judgment are identified, documented and reported to senior management as part of the valuation control process and the 
standard monthly reporting cycle. The specialist model validation and valuation control groups focus attention on the areas of 
subjectivity and judgment.  

The level of management judgment required in establishing fair value of financial instruments for which there is a quoted price 
in an active market is usually minimal. Similarly there is little subjectivity or judgment required for instruments valued using 
valuation models which are standard across the industry and where all parameter inputs are quoted in active markets. 

The level of subjectivity and degree of management judgment required is more significant for those instruments valued using 
specialized  and  sophisticated  models  and  where  some  or  all  of  the  parameter  inputs  are  less  liquid  or  less  observable. 
Management judgment  is  required in  the selection  and application  of  appropriate  parameters,  assumptions  and  modelling 
techniques. In particular, where data are obtained from infrequent market transactions then extrapolation and interpolation 
techniques must be applied. Where no market data are available for a particular instrument then pricing inputs are determined 
by  assessing  other  relevant  sources  of  information  such  as  historical  data,  fundamental  analysis  of  the  economics  of  the 
transaction and proxy information from similar transactions, and making appropriate adjustment to reflect the actual instrument 
being valued and current market conditions. Where different valuation techniques indicate a range of possible fair values for 
an instrument then management has to decide what point within the range of estimates appropriately represents the fair value. 
Further, some valuation adjustments may require the exercise of management judgment to achieve fair value.  

Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be disclosed according to the inputs to the valuation method 
that are used to determine their fair value. Specifically, segmentation is required between those valued using quoted market 
prices in an active market (level 1), valuation techniques based on observable parameters (level 2) and valuation techniques 
using significant unobservable parameters (level 3). Management judgment is required in determining the category to which 
certain instruments should be allocated. This specifically arises when the valuation is determined by a number of parameters, 
some of which are observable and others are not. Further, the classification of an instrument can change over time to reflect 
changes in market liquidity and therefore price transparency. 

The Group provides a sensitivity analysis of the impact upon the level 3 financial instruments of using a reasonably possible 
alternative  for  the  unobservable  parameter.  The  determination  of  reasonably  possible  alternatives  requires  significant 
management judgment. 

For financial instruments measured at amortized cost (which include loans, deposits and short and long term debt issued) the 
Group discloses the fair value. Generally there is limited or no trading activity in these instruments and therefore the fair value 
determination requires significant management judgment. 

For further discussion of the valuation methods and controls and quantitative disclosures with respect to the determination of 
fair  value,  please  refer  to  Note 13  “Financial  Instruments  carried  at  Fair  Value”  and  Note 14  “Fair  Value  of  Financial 
Instruments not carried at Fair Value”.

Recognition of trade date profit  

Trade  date  profit  is  recognized  if  the  fair  value  of  the  financial  instrument  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  is 
obtained from a quoted market price in an active market, or otherwise evidenced by comparison to other observable current 
market  transactions  or  based  on  a  valuation  technique  incorporating  observable  market  data.  If  there  are  significant 
unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique, the financial instrument is recognized at the transaction price and any 
profit implied from the valuation technique at trade date is deferred.  

Using systematic methods, the deferred amount is recognized over the period between trade date and the date when the 
market  is  expected  to  become  observable,  or  over  the  life  of  the  trade  (whichever  is  shorter).  Such  methodology  is  used 
because it reflects the changing economic and risk profile of the instrument as the market develops or as the instrument itself 
progresses to maturity. Any remaining trade date deferred profit is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when 
the transaction becomes observable.  

Critical Accounting Estimates – Management judgment is required in determining whether there exist significant unobservable 
inputs  in  the  valuation  technique  of  the  underlying  financial  instrument  (refer  to  section  “Determination  of  Fair  Value”  for 
management  judgment  required  in  establishing  fair  value  of  financial  instruments).  Once  deferred,  the  decision  to 
subsequently  recognize  the  trade  date  profit  requires  a  careful  assessment  of  the  then  current  facts  and  circumstances 
supporting observability of parameters and/or risk mitigation. 

Derivatives and hedge accounting 

Derivatives are used to manage exposures to interest rate, foreign currency, credit and other market price risks, including 
exposures  arising  from  forecast  transactions.  All  freestanding  contracts  that  are  considered  derivatives  for  accounting 
purposes are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet regardless of whether they are held for trading or non-
trading purposes. 

The changes in fair value on derivatives held for trading are included in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss. 

Hedge accounting 

IFRS 9 includes an accounting policy choice to defer the adoption of IFRS 9 hedge accounting and to continue with IAS 39 
hedge accounting. The Group decided to exercise this accounting policy choice and did not adopt IFRS 9 hedge accounting 
as of January 1, 2018. The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (fair value macro 
hedges)  in  accordance  with  the  EU  carve-out  version  of  IAS 39. Under the  EU  IAS  39  carve-out,  fair value  macro  hedge 
accounting may be applied to core deposits and hedge ineffectiveness for all fair value macro hedge accounting applications 
is only recognized when the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets falls below the original 
designated amount of that bucket and is not recognized when the revised amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is 
more than the original designated amount.  

For accounting purposes the Group applies the following types of hedges: 

–  For  hedges  of  changes  in  fair  value,  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged  asset,  liability  or  unrecognized  firm 
commitment, or a portion thereof, attributable to the risk being hedged, are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income along with changes in the entire fair value of the derivative. When hedging interest rate risk, any interest accrued 
or paid on both the derivative and the hedged item is reported in interest income or expense and the unrealized gains and 
losses from the hedge accounting fair value adjustments are reported in other revenue. Hedge ineffectiveness is reported 
in other revenue and is measured as the net effect of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in 
the fair value of the hedged item arising from changes in the market rate or price related to the risk(s) being hedged. 

If  a  fair  value  hedge  of  a  debt  instrument  is  discontinued  prior  to  the  instrument’s  maturity  because  the  derivative  is 
terminated  or  the  relationship  is  de-designated,  any  remaining  interest  rate-related  fair  value  adjustments  made  to  the 
carrying amount of the debt instrument (basis adjustments) are amortized to interest income or expense over the remaining 
term of the original hedging relationship. For other types of fair value adjustments and whenever a fair value hedged asset 
or liability is sold or otherwise derecognized, any basis adjustments are included in the calculation of the gain or loss on 
derecognition.

Annual Report 2023 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

–  For hedges of variability in future cash flows, there is no change to the accounting for the hedged item and the derivative 
is carried at fair value, with changes in value reported initially in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is 
effective.  These  amounts  initially  recorded  in  other  comprehensive  income  are  subsequently  reclassified  into  the 
Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  in  the  same  periods  during  which  the  forecast  transaction  affects  the  Consolidated 
Statement of Income. Thus, for hedges of interest rate risk, the amounts are amortized into interest income or expense at 
the same time as the interest is accrued on the hedged transaction. 

Hedge  ineffectiveness  is  recorded  in  other  income  and  is  measured  as  changes  in  the  excess  (if  any)  in  the  absolute 
cumulative change in fair value of the actual hedging derivative over the absolute cumulative change in the fair value of the 
hypothetically perfect hedge. 

When  hedges  of  variability  in  cash  flows  attributable  to  interest  rate  risk  are  discontinued,  amounts  remaining  in 
accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  are  amortized  to  interest  income  or  expense  over  the  remaining  life  of  the 
original hedge relationship, unless the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur in which case the amount will be 
reclassified  into  other  income  immediately.  When  hedges  of  variability  in  cash  flows  attributable  to  other  risks  are 
discontinued,  the  related  amounts  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  are  reclassified  into  either  the  same 
Consolidated Statement of Income caption and period as profit or loss from the forecast transaction, or into other income 
when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur. 

–  For hedges of the translation adjustments resulting from translating the functional currency financial statements of foreign 
operations (hedges of net investments in foreign operations) into the functional currency of the parent, the portion of the 
change in fair value of the derivative due to changes in the spot foreign exchange rates is recorded as a foreign currency 
translation adjustment in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective; the remainder is recorded as 
other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Changes in fair value of the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are subsequently recognized in 
profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operations.  

Hedging  derivatives  are  reported  as  other  assets  and  other  liabilities.  In  the  event  that  a  derivative  is  subsequently  de-
designated from a hedging relationship, it is transferred to financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 

Impairment of loans and provision for off-balance sheet positions  

The impairment requirements of IFRS 9 apply to all credit exposures that are measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, and to 
off balance sheet lending commitments such as loan commitments and financial guarantees. For purposes of the impairment 
policy below, these instruments are referred to as (“Financial Assets”)  

The determination of impairment losses under IFRS 9 uses an expected credit loss (“ECL”) model, where allowances are 
taken  upon  initial  recognition  of  the  Financial  Asset,  based  on  expectations  of  potential  credit  losses  at  the  time  of  initial 
recognition. 

Staged approach to the determination of expected credit losses 

IFRS 9 states a three-stage approach to impairment for Financial Assets that are not credit-impaired at the date of origination 
or purchase. This approach is summarized as follows: 

–  Stage 1:  The  Group  recognizes  a  credit  loss  allowance  at  an  amount  equal  to  12-month  expected  credit  losses  for  all 
Financial Assets. This represents the portion of lifetime expected credit losses from default events that are expected within 
12 months of the reporting date, assuming that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition. 

–  Stage 2: The Group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for those 
Financial Assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. This 
requires  the  determination  of  the  ECL  based  on  lifetime  probability  of  default,  lifetime  loss  given  default  and  lifetime 
exposure at default that represents the probability of default occurring over the remaining lifetime of the Financial Asset. 
Allowance for credit losses are higher in this stage because of an increase in credit risk since origination or purchase and 
the impact of a longer time horizon being considered compared to 12 months in Stage 1. 

–  Stage 3:  The  Group  recognizes  a  loss  allowance  at  an  amount  equal  to  lifetime  expected  credit  losses,  reflecting  a 
Probability of Default of 100%, via the expected recoverable cash flows for the asset, for those Financial Assets that are 
credit-impaired. The Group’s definition of default is aligned with the regulatory definition of default. Financial Assets that 
are credit-impaired upon initial recognition are categorized within Stage 3 with a carrying value already reflecting the lifetime 
expected  credit  losses.  The  accounting  treatment  for  these  purchased  or  originated  credit-impaired  (“POCI”)  assets  is 
discussed further below.

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

ECL are calculated using three main parameters: probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default 
(EAD). These parameters are generally derived from internally developed statistical models combined with historical, current 
and forward-looking information, including macro-economic data. The 12-month and lifetime PD represent the expected point-
in-time probability of a default over the next 12 months and remaining expected lifetime of the financial instrument, respectively, 
based  on  conditions  existing  at  the  balance  sheet  date  and  future  economic  conditions  that  affect  credit  risk.  The  LGD 
represents  expected  loss  conditional  on  default,  incorporating  the  mitigating  effect  of  collateral,  its  expected  value  when 
realized and the time value of money. The EAD represents the expected exposure at default, factoring in the repayment of 
principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdown of a facility. 

Forward-Looking  Information  is  incorporated  into  the  measurement  of  the  Group  Allowance  for  Credit  Losses  in  terms  of 
adjustments to multi-year PD curves based on macro-economic forecasts. 

The Group’s ECL model is used to calculate the allowance for credit losses for all financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2, as 
well as for Stage 3 in the homogeneous portfolio (i.e. retail and small business loans with similar credit risk characteristics). 
For financial assets in the bank’s non-homogeneous portfolio in Stage 3 and for POCI assets, the allowance for credit losses 
is determined individually by credit officers. 

Significant increase in credit risk  

When  determining  whether  the  credit risk  (i.e.,  risk  of  default)  of  a  Financial  Asset  has  increased  significantly  since  initial 
recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or 
effort. This includes quantitative and qualitative information based on the Group’s historical experience, credit risk assessment 
and forward-looking information (including macro-economic factors). The assessment of significant credit deterioration is key 
in determining when to move from measuring an allowance based on 12-month ECLs to one that is based on lifetime ECLs 
(i.e., transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2).  

The Group’s framework for determining if there has been a significant increase in credit risk aligns with the internal Credit Risk 
Management (“CRM”) process and utilizes: 

–  Rating related indicators – based on a model that compares lifetime probability of default (PD) at the reporting date with 
the lifetime PD expectations at the date of initial recognition and subsequently applies a quantile approach to determine a 
threshold to define the trigger point for a financial asset’s transition into Stage 2; and  

–  Process  related  indicators  –  which  uses  existing  risk  management  indicators,  that  in  Management’s  view  represent 
situations  where the  credit risk  of  financial  assets  has  significantly  increased.  These include obligors being added  to a 
credit  watchlist,  being  mandatorily  transferred  to  workout  status,  payments  being  30  days  or  more  past  due  or  in 
forbearance. 

These indicators are discussed further in section “IFRS 9 Impairment Approach” in the Risk Report. 

Credit-impaired financial assets in Stage 3 

The Group has aligned its definition of credit-impaired under IFRS 9 to when a Financial Asset has defaulted for regulatory 
purposes, according to the Capital Requirements Regulation under Art. 178. 

The determination of whether a Financial Asset is credit-impaired and therefore in Stage 3 focusses exclusively on default 
risk,  without  taking  into  consideration  the  effects  of  credit  risk  mitigants  such  as  collateral  or  guarantees.  Specifically,  a 
Financial Asset is credit-impaired and in Stage 3 when: 

–  The Group considers the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group. Determination may include forbearance 
actions, where a concession has been granted to the borrower or economic or legal reasons that are qualitative indicators 
of credit impairment; or 

–  Contractual payments of either principal or interest by the obligor are past due by more than 90 days. 

For Financial Assets considered to be credit-impaired, the ECL allowance covers the amount of loss the Group is expected to 
suffer. The estimation of ECLs is undertaken on a case-by-case basis for non-homogeneous portfolios, or by applying portfolio 
based parameters to individual Financial Assets in these portfolios via the Group’s ECL model for homogeneous portfolios. 
This estimate includes the use of discounted cash flows that are adjusted for scenarios.  

Forecasts of future economic conditions when calculating ECLs are considered. The lifetime expected losses are estimated 
based on the probability-weighted present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group 
under the contract; and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive.

Annual Report 2023 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

A Financial Asset can be classified as credit-impaired in Stage 3 but without an allowance for credit losses (i.e., no impairment 
loss is expected). This may be due to the value of collateral. The Group’s engine based ECL calculation is conducted on a 
monthly basis, whereas the case-by-case assessment of ECL in Stage 3 for non-homogeneous portfolio has to be performed 
at least on a quarterly basis. 

Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets in Stage 3 

A Financial Asset is considered purchased or originated credit-impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment at the time 
of initial recognition. Such credit-impaired Financial Assets are termed POCI Financial  Assets. POCI Financial Assets are 
measured to reflect lifetime expected credit losses, and all subsequent changes in lifetime expected credit losses, whether 
positive or negative, are recognized in the income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses. POCI Financial 
Assets can only be classified in Stage 3 over the life of the Financial Asset. 

Write-offs 

The Group reduces the gross  carrying amount of a Financial Asset when there is no reasonable expectation of  recovery. 
Write-offs can relate to a Financial Asset in its entirety, or to a portion of it, and constitute a derecognition event. The Group 
considers all relevant information in making this determination, including but not limited to: 

–  Foreclosure actions taken by the Group which have not been successful or have a high probability of not being successful 
–  Collateral liquidation which has not, or will not lead to further considerable recoveries 
–  Situations where no further recoveries are reasonably expected 

Write-offs can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded, and a write-off 
does not involve the Group forfeiting its legal right to recover the debt. 

Interest Rate used in the IFRS 9 model 

In the context of the ECL calculation, the Group applies in line with IFRS 9 an approximation of the EIR, which is usually the 
contractual interest rate (“CIR”) and which does not materially differ from the EIR. The CIR is deemed to be an appropriate 
approximation, as the interest rate is consistently used in the ECL model, interest recognition and for discounting of the ECL. 

Collateral for financial assets considered in the impairment analysis 

IFRS 9 requires cash flows expected from collateral and other credit enhancement to be reflected in the ECL calculation. The 
following are key aspects with respect to collateral and guarantees: 

–  Eligibility of collateral, i.e. which collateral should be considered in the ECL calculation; 
–  Collateral evaluation, i.e. what collateral (liquidation) value should be used; and 
–  Projection of the available collateral amount over the life of a transaction. 

These concepts are outlined in more detail in section “IFRS 9 Impairment Approach” in the Risk Report.  

Critical accounting estimates – The accounting estimates and judgments related to the impairment of Financial Assets is a 
critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used can change from period to period and may significantly 
affect the Group’s results of operations.  

In assessing assets for impairments, management judgment is required, particularly in projecting forward looking information 
and  scenarios  in  particular  in  circumstances  of  economic  and  financial  uncertainty,  when  developments  and  changes  to 
expected cash flows can occur both with greater rapidity and less predictability. The actual amount of the future cash flows 
and their timing may differ from the estimates used by management and consequently may cause actual losses to differ from 
reported allowances. 

For  those  non-homogeneous  loans  in  Stage 3  the  determination  of  the  impairment  allowance  often  requires  the  use  of 
considerable judgment concerning such matters as local economic conditions, the financial performance of the counterparty 
and the value of any collateral held, for which there may not be a readily accessible market.  

The determination of the expected credit losses in Stages 1 and 2 and for homogeneous loans in Stage 3 is calculated using 
the Group’s ECL model. The model incorporates numerous estimates and judgments. The Group performs a regular review 
of the model and underlying data and assumptions. The probability of defaults, loss recovery rates and judgments concerning 
ability of borrowers in foreign countries to transfer the foreign currency necessary to comply with debt repayments, amongst 
other  things,  are  incorporated  into  this  review.  Management  judgement  is  required  over  the  following  critical  accounting 
estimates:

–  Forward-Looking Information: The identification of key macro-economic variables (MEVs) reflects a balance of quantitative 
and qualitative judgements. Statistical analysis, including for example, back-testing and model sensitivities, are performed 
to assess the explanatory power of MEVs, while expert input from credit officers ensures management comfort in the overall 
model behavior. The final model parameterization is based on a review and challenge of impacts in internal governance 
forums  and  an  independent  validation  performed  by  the  Model  Risk  Management  function.  Furthermore,  conceptual 
soundness of the estimation approach is ensured by model testing analysis prepared as part of model changes and an 
ongoing monitoring framework in order for the ECL provision to reflect management’s best estimate in the calculation of 
expected credit losses. 

–  Significant Increase in Credit Risk: In line with the section “IFRS 9 Impairment Approach” in the Risk Report, the Group 
uses rating-related indicators to determine whether a financial asset’s credit risk has significantly increased since inception. 
For financial assets in non-homogeneous portfolios the ratings are determined for every counterparty individually based on 
credit officer’s expert judgement. For financial assets in the homogeneous portfolios (due to the large number of client 
relationships)  the  rating  process  is  significantly  automated  with  less  judgement  required  by  credit  officers  on  individual 
counterparties. For both homogeneous and non-homogenous portfolios the rating-related indicators to determine whether 
the credit risk for a financial asset has significantly increased are based on a model that compares lifetime PDs at the 
reporting  date  with  the  lifetime  PD  expectations  at  the  date  of  initial  recognition  and  subsequently  applying  a  quantile 
approach  to  determine  a  threshold  which  defines  the  trigger  point  for  a  financial  asset’s  transition  into  Stage 2.  The 
determination of the quantile to define Stage 2 thresholds are determined by subject matter experts in the Group’s Risk 
function. This represents one of the key critical judgments in the Group’s IFRS 9 framework and is reviewed on an annual 
basis based on detailed stage-mover analyses, benchmarking with historical behaviors and peer comparisons. 

–  Stage  3  Loss  Given  Default  (LGD)  Setting  for  Homogeneous  Portfolios:  The  allowance  for  credit  losses  in  Stage 3  is 
determined for the Group’s homogeneous portfolios by an automated process based on partially time dependent LGDs 
reflecting the lower recovery expectation the longer the client is in default, thereby differentiating between secured and 
unsecured  exposures.  The  LGDs  are  calibrated  using  the  Group’s  loss  history  built  up  over  preceding  decades, 
experienced market prices of non-performing portfolios sold and expert judgement. In the case of less material portfolios, 
the empirical calibration of the LGD is partially supported by expert credit officer judgements, especially for determining the 
client cure rates as one of the key inputs. The LGD settings are validated on an annual basis and are regularly reviewed 
by the Group’s independent model validation process which is part of the Model Risk Management function. 

–  Model  adjustments:  The  Group  regularly  reviews  key  inputs  into  the  ECL  calculation  and  discusses  potential  model 
imprecision  to  assess  the  need  for  corrective  measures  in  the  form  of  overlays.  Overlays  are  an  essential  output  of 
management judgment which feeds into the model. On a quarterly basis, a senior management forum discusses the need 
for the recognition and/or the release of overlays. The discussion will be based on an overview of potential reasons which 
might require an overlay considering specific trigger points. The ultimate decision for creating overlays is jointly made by 
the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Risk Officer (CRO). 

The quantitative disclosures are provided in Note 18 “Loans” and Note 19 “Allowance for credit losses” as well as the Risk 
Report, section “IFRS 9 Impairment”, sub-section “Model Sensitivity”. 

Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities  

Financial asset derecognition 

A financial asset is considered for derecognition when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, 
or the Group has either transferred the contractual right to receive the cash flows from that asset, or has assumed an obligation 
to pay those cash flows to one or more recipients, subject to certain criteria. 

The Group derecognizes a transferred financial asset if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.  

The Group enters into transactions in which it transfers previously recognized financial assets but retains substantially all the 
associated risks and rewards of those assets; for example, a sale to a third party in which the Group enters into a concurrent 
total return swap with the same counterparty. These types of transactions are accounted for as secured financing transactions. 

Derecognition of financial liabilities 

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. If an existing 
financial  liability  is  replaced  by  another  from  the  same  lender  on  substantially  different  terms,  or  the  terms  of  the  existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and 
the  recognition  of  a  new  liability,  and  the  difference  in  the  respective  carrying  amounts  is  recognized  in  the  Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

Certain  OTC derivative contracts  and  most  exchange-traded  futures and  option  contracts  cleared through  central  clearing 
counterparties and exchanges have payment or receipt of variation margin on a daily basis that represents legal or economic 
settlement of the outstanding derivative’s present value. This results in derecognition of the associated derivative financial 
asset and financial liabilities. 

Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements  

Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse repurchase agreements”) and securities sold under agreements to 
repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) are treated as collateralized financings and are recognized initially at fair value, being 
the amount of cash disbursed and received, respectively.  

The Group allocates reverse repurchase portfolios that are managed on a fair value basis to the other business model under 
IFRS 9 and classifies them as “Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss”.  

Interest earned on reverse repurchase agreements and interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as interest 
income and interest expense, respectively. 

Securities borrowed and securities loaned  

Securities borrowed transactions generally require the Group to deposit cash with the securities lender. In a securities loaned 
transaction, the Group generally receives either cash collateral, in an amount equal to or in excess of the market value of 
securities loaned, or securities.  

The  securities  borrowed  are  not  themselves  recognized  in  the  financial  statements.  If  they  are  sold  to  third  parties,  the 
obligation to return the securities is recorded as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss and any subsequent gain 
or loss is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss. Securities lent to counterparties are also retained on the Consolidated balance sheet. 

The Group records the amount of cash advanced or received as securities borrowed and securities loaned, respectively, in 
the Consolidated balance sheet. 

Fees received or paid are reported in interest income and interest expense, respectively. Securities lent to  counterparties 
which are not derecognized from the Consolidated balance sheet and where the counterparty has the right by contract or 
custom to sell or repledge the collateral are disclosed in Note 20 “Transfer of Financial Assets, Assets Pledged and Received 
as Collateral”. 

Goodwill and other intangible assets  

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates and represents the excess of the aggregate of the cost of an 
acquisition and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired at the 
date of the acquisition. 

For the purpose of calculating goodwill, fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined by 
reference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. This discounting is either performed 
using market rates or by using risk-free rates and risk-adjusted expected future cash flows. Any noncontrolling interests in the 
acquiree are measured either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets (this is determined for each business combination). 

Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalized and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are 
indications  that  impairment  may  have  occurred.  For  the  purposes  of  impairment  testing,  goodwill  acquired  in  a  business 
combination is allocated to cash-generating units (“CGUs”), which are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate 
cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets and that are expected to benefit 
from  the  synergies  of  the  combination  and  considering  the  business  level  at  which  goodwill  is  monitored  for  internal 
management purposes. In identifying whether cash inflows from an asset (or a group of assets) are largely independent of the 
cash inflows from other assets (or groups of assets) various factors are considered, including how management monitors the 
entity’s operations or makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entity’s assets and operations.

Annual Report 2023 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

If goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and an operation within that unit is disposed of, the attributable goodwill is included 
in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on its disposal. 

Corporate assets are allocated to a CGU when the allocation can be done on a reasonable and consistent basis. If this is not 
possible, the individual CGU is tested without the corporate assets. They are then tested on the level of the minimum collection 
of CGUs to which they can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis. 

Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal 
rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets that have a finite useful life are stated at cost less any 
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Customer-related intangible assets that have a finite useful 
life are amortized over periods of between 1 and 20 years on a straight-line basis based on their expected useful life. These 
assets are tested for impairment and their useful lives reaffirmed at least annually. 

Certain intangible assets have an indefinite useful life and hence are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. 

Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits 
will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method 
over the asset’s useful life which is deemed to be either three, five or ten years. Eligible costs include external direct costs for 
materials  and  services,  as  well  as  payroll  and  payroll-related  costs  for employees  directly  associated  with  an  internal-use 
software project. Overhead costs, as well as costs incurred during the research phase or after software is ready for use, are 
expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are tested for impairment either annually if still under development or any 
time when there is an indication of impairment once the software is in use. 

Critical accounting estimates – The determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of non-financial 
assets requires estimates based on quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, present value or other valuation 
techniques (such as the cost approach), or a combination thereof, necessitating management to make subjective judgments 
and assumptions. Because these estimates and assumptions could result in significant differences to the amounts reported if 
underlying circumstances were to change, the Group considers these estimates to be critical.  

The quantitative disclosures are provided in Note 23 “Goodwill and other intangible assets”. 

Provisions  

Provisions are recognized if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, if it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation.  

The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation as of 
the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. 

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party (for 
example,  because  the  obligation  is  covered  by  an  insurance  policy),  an  asset  is  recognized  if  it  is  virtually  certain  that 
reimbursement will be received. 

If  the  Group  has  a  contract  that  is  onerous,  the  present  obligation  under  the  contract  is  recognized  and  measured  as  a 
provision.  An  onerous  contract  is  a  contract  in  which  the  unavoidable  costs  of  meeting  the  obligations  under  the  contract 
exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. 

Critical accounting estimates –The use of estimates is important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise 
from litigation and regulatory proceedings. The Group estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out of litigation 
and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated, in accordance with IAS 37, 
“Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the 
Group’s final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. 

Contingencies  in  respect  of  legal  matters  are  subject  to  many  uncertainties  and  the  outcome  of  individual  matters  is  not 
predictable  with  assurance.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  probability  and  making  estimates  in  respect  of 
contingencies,  and  the  Group’s  final  liability  may  ultimately  be  materially  different.  The  Group’s  total  liability  in  respect  of 
litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable 
losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Group’s experience and the experience of others 
in  similar  cases,  and  the  opinions  and  views  of  legal  counsel.  Predicting  the  outcome  of  the  Group’s  litigation  matters  is 
inherently  difficult,  particularly  in  cases  in  which  claimants  seek  substantial  or  indeterminate  damages.  See  Note 27 
“Provisions” for further information on the uncertainties from the Group’s judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings.

01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

Income taxes 

The Group recognizes the current and deferred tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated 
financial statements using the provisions of the respective jurisdictions’ tax laws. Current and deferred taxes are recognized 
in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items that are recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive 
income in which case the related tax is recognized either directly in equity or other comprehensive income accordingly. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between 
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, unused tax losses 
and unused tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will  be  available  against  which  those  unused  tax  losses,  unused  tax  credits  and  deductible  temporary  differences  can  be 
utilized. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period that the asset 
is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.  

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when (1) they arise from the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting 
entities, (2) the legally enforceable right to offset exists and (3) they are intended to be settled net or realized simultaneously.  

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities exists 
and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxing authority on either the same tax 
reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities. 

Deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and 
associates and interests in joint ventures except when the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 
the Group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are 
provided  on  deductible  temporary  differences  arising  from  such  investments  only  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  the 
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and sufficient taxable income will be available against which those temporary 
differences can be utilized. 

Deferred tax related to fair value remeasurement of financial assets classified as FVTOCI, cash flow hedges and other items, 
which  are  charged  or  credited  directly  to  other  comprehensive  income,  is  also  credited  or  charged  directly  to  other 
comprehensive  income  and  subsequently  recognized  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  once  the  underlying 
transaction or event to which the deferred tax relates is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

For share-based payment transactions, the Group may receive a tax deduction related to the compensation paid in shares. 
The amount deductible for tax purposes may differ from the cumulative compensation expense recorded. At any reporting 
date, the Group must estimate the expected future tax deduction based on the current share price. The associated current 
and deferred tax consequences are recognized as income or expense in the consolidated statement of Income for the period. 
If the amount deductible, or expected to be deductible, for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation expense, the 
excess tax benefit is recognized directly in equity.  

Critical accounting estimates – In determining the amount of deferred tax assets, the Group uses historical tax capacity and 
profitability information and, if relevant, forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans, including a review 
of the eligible carry-forward periods, available tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. The analysis of 
the historical tax capacity includes the determination as to whether a period of past profits or a history of recent losses exists 
at the reporting date. The determination of a period of past profits or a history of recent losses is based on the pre-tax results 
adjusted for permanent differences and typically covers the current and the two preceding financial years. Each quarter, the 
Group re-evaluates its estimate related to deferred tax assets.  

The Group believes that the accounting estimate related to the deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because 
the underlying assumptions can change from period to period and requires significant management judgment. For example, 
tax law changes, changes in the historical tax capacity or variances in future projected operating performance could result in 
a change of the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset. If the Group was not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax 
assets in the future, an adjustment to its deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense or directly to equity in 
the period such determination was made. If the Group was to recognize previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the 
future, an adjustment to its deferred tax asset would be credited to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such 
determination was made.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

The use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from uncertain income tax 
positions.  The  Group  estimates  and  provides  for  potential  losses  that  may  arise  out  of  uncertain  income  tax  positions,  in 
accordance with IAS 12, “Income Taxes” and IFRIC 23, “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment”. Significant judgment is 
required in making these estimates and the Group’s final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. 

For further information on the Group’s income taxes (including quantitative disclosures on recognized deferred tax assets) 
see Note 34 “Income Taxes”. 

Business combinations and noncontrolling Interests 

The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. At the date the Group obtains control of the 
subsidiary, the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration given, including any cash or non-cash 
consideration (equity instruments) transferred, any contingent consideration, any previously held equity interest in the acquiree 
and liabilities incurred or assumed. The excess of the aggregate of the cost of an acquisition and any noncontrolling interests 
in the acquiree over the Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the 
aggregate of the acquisition cost and any noncontrolling interests is below the fair value of the identifiable net assets (negative 
goodwill), a gain is reported in other income. Acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they 
are incurred. 

In  business  combinations  achieved  in  stages  (“step  acquisitions”),  a  previously  held  equity  interest  in  the  acquiree  is 
remeasured to its acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts 
recognized  in  prior  periods  in  other  comprehensive  income  associated  with  the  previously  held  investment  would  be 
recognized on the same basis as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the previously held equity interest. 

Noncontrolling interests are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of equity, which is distinct 
from the Group’s shareholders’ equity. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is separately disclosed on the 
face of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in the ownership interest in subsidiaries which do not result in a 
change of control are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in additional paid-in capital (“APIC”). 

Non-current assets held for sale  

Individual non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if they are available for immediate sale in 
their  present  condition  subject  only  to  the  customary  sales  terms  of  such  assets  (and  disposal  groups)  and  their  sale  is 
considered highly probable. For a sale to be highly probable, management must be committed to a sales plan and be actively 
looking for a buyer and has no substantive regulatory approvals outstanding. Furthermore, the assets (and disposal groups) 
must be actively marketed at a reasonable sales price in relation to their current fair value and the sale should be expected to 
be completed within one year. Non-current non-financial assets (and disposal groups) which meet the criteria for held for sale 
classification are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and are presented within 
“Other assets” and “Other liabilities” in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities meeting the criteria continue to be 
measured in accordance with IFRS 9. The comparatives are not represented when non-current assets (and disposal groups) 
are classified as held for sale.  

Property and equipment  

Property  and  equipment  includes  own-use  properties,  leasehold  improvements,  furniture  and  equipment  and  software 
(operating  systems  only).  Right-of-use  assets  are  presented  together  with  property  and  equipment  on  the  Group’s 
consolidated  balance  sheet.  Own-use  properties  are  carried  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated 
impairment losses. Depreciation is generally recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets.  The  range  of  estimated  useful  lives  is  25  to  50 years  for  property  and  3  to  10 years  for  furniture  and  equipment 
(including  initial  improvements  to  purchased  buildings).  Leasehold  improvements  are  capitalized  and  subsequently 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease and the estimated useful life of the improvement, 
which generally ranges from 3 to 25 years. Depreciation of property and equipment is included in general and administrative 
expenses. Maintenance and repairs are also charged to general and administrative expenses. Gains and losses on disposals 
are included in other income. 

Property  and  equipment  are assessed  for any  indication  of  impairment  at  each  quarterly  reporting  date.  If  such  indication 
exists, the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, must be estimated 
and an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. Value in use is 
the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. After the recognition of impairment of an 
asset, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the asset’s revised carrying amount. If an impairment is 
later reversed, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.

Financial guarantees 

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a 
loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. 

Financial guarantees written 

The Group has chosen to apply the fair value option to certain written financial guarantees that are managed on a fair value 
basis. Financial guarantees that the Group has not designated at fair value are initially recognized at fair value on the date the 
guarantee is given. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group’s liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher 
of the amount initially recognized, less cumulative amortization, and the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
any financial obligation as of the balance sheet date. These estimates are determined by management based on experience 
with similar transactions and history of past losses. 

Any increase in the liability relating to guarantees is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in provision for credit 
losses. 

Financial guarantees purchased 

Purchased financial guarantees result in reimbursements under IAS 37 to the extent that the financial guarantee is entered 
into to mitigate the credit exposure from debt instruments with HTC or HTC&S business models. This results in recognition of 
a  reimbursement  asset  for  subsequent  increases  in  the  expected  credit  losses,  to  the  extent  it  is  virtually  certain  that  the 
purchased financial guarantee will reimburse the Group for the loss incurred. Accordingly, when the credit risk of the borrower 
significantly deteriorates a reimbursement asset is recognized equal to the life-time expected credit losses and is presented 
as  Other  Assets  in  the  Group’s  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  The  corresponding  reimbursement  gain  is  recognized  as  a 
reduction in the Provision for credit losses in the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Income.  

Purchased financial guarantees entered into to mitigate credit exposure from debt instruments allocated to HTC or HTC&S 
business models may also be embedded in Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLO’s) issued by the Group. Such embedded 
guarantees are not accounted for separately as a reimbursement asset and are instead accounted as part of the CLO’s liability 
held at amortized cost. The Group regularly revises its estimated contractual redemption payment (including the benefit of 
such embedded guarantees) from the CLO when the credit risk of a borrower covered by the embedded financial guarantee 
in the CLO significantly deteriorates. The revision is based on the life-time expected credit losses of the debt instrument (to 
the extent covered by the CLO).  

Purchased financial guarantees entered into to mitigate credit exposure from debt instruments included in the Other business 
model are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. 

Leasing transactions 

The Group enters into lease contracts, predominantly for land and buildings, as a lessee. Other categories are company cars 
and technical/IT equipment. 

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement 
date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of 
lease  liabilities  is  increased  to  reflect  the  accretion  of  interest  and  reduced  for the  lease  payments  made.  In  addition, the 
carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term or a change in the 
lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease 
payments). 

Right-of-use assets are assessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. If such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount, which is the fair value less costs of disposal, must be estimated and an impairment charge is recorded 
to  the  extent  the  recoverable  amount  is  less  than  the  carrying  amount.  As  right-of-use  assets  do  not  have  independently 
generated cash flows to calculate its value in use, the Group considers any sublease income that could reasonably be earned. 
After the recognition of impairment of  an asset, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the asset’s 
revised carrying amount. If an impairment is later reversed, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

The Group presents right-of-use assets in “Property and Equipment” and lease liabilities in “Other Liabilities”.  

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases, i.e., those leases that have a lease 
term of 12 months or less from the commencement date. It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption 
to leases of technical/IT equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of 
low value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Employee benefits 

Pension benefits 

The Group provides a number of pension plans. In addition to defined contribution plans, there are retirement benefit plans 
accounted for as defined benefit plans. The assets of all the Group’s defined contribution plans are held in independently 
administered funds. Contributions are generally determined as a percentage of salary and are expensed based on employee 
services rendered, generally in the year of contribution. 

All  retirement  benefit  plans  accounted  for  as  defined  benefit  plans  are  valued  using  the  projected  unit-credit  method  to 
determine  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  and  the  related  service  costs.  Under  this  method,  the 
determination is based on actuarial calculations which include assumptions about demographics, salary increases and interest 
and inflation rates. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in equity in the 
period in which they occur. The majority of the Group’s benefit plans is funded. 

For the Group’s most significant pension plans in the key countries, the discount rate used at each measurement date is set 
based on a high-quality corporate bond yield curve – derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable 
third-party index data providers and rating agencies – reflecting the timing, amount and currency of the future expected benefit 
payments for the respective plan. 

Other post-employment benefits 

In addition, the Group maintains unfunded contributory post-employment medical plans for a number of current and retired 
employees who are mainly located in the United States. These plans pay stated percentages of eligible medical and dental 
expenses of retirees after a stated deductible has been met. The Group funds these plans on a cash basis as benefits are 
due. Analogous to retirement benefit plans these plans are valued using the projected unit-credit method. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognized in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income and presented in equity. 

Refer to Note 33 “Employee benefits” for further information on the accounting for pension benefits and other post-employment 
benefits. 

Termination benefits 

Termination benefits arise when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date or whenever an 
employee  accepts  voluntary  redundancy  in  exchange  for  these  benefits.  The  Group  recognizes  termination  benefits  as  a 
liability  and  an  expense  if  the  Group  is  demonstrably  committed  to  a  detailed  formal  plan  without  realistic  possibility  of 
withdrawal. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, termination benefits are measured based on the 
number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than twelve months after the end of the reporting 
period are discounted to their present value. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality 
corporate bonds. 

Share-based compensation 

Compensation expense for awards classified as equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of 
the share-based award. For share awards, the fair value is the quoted market price of the share reduced by the present value 
of the expected dividends that will not be received by the employee and adjusted for the effect, if any, of restrictions beyond 
the vesting date. In case an award is modified such that its fair value immediately after modification exceeds its fair value 
immediately  prior  to  modification,  a  remeasurement  takes  place  and  the  resulting  increase  in  fair  value  is  recognized  as 
additional compensation expense.

Annual Report 2023 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

The  Group  records  the  offsetting  amount  to  the  recognized  compensation  expense  in  additional  paid-in  capital  (“APIC”). 
Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the period in which employees perform services to which the 
awards relate or over the period of the tranches for those awards delivered in tranches. Estimates of expected forfeitures are 
periodically adjusted in the event of actual forfeitures or for changes in expectations. The timing of expense recognition relating 
to grants which, due to early retirement provisions, include a nominal but non-substantive service period are accelerated by 
shortening the amortization period of the expense from the grant date to the date when the employee meets the eligibility 
criteria  for  the  award,  and  not  the  vesting  date.  For  awards  that  are  delivered  in  tranches,  each  tranche  is  considered  a 
separate award and amortized separately. 

Compensation expense for share-based awards payable in cash is remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and 
recognized over the vesting period in which the related employee services are rendered. The related obligations are included 
in other liabilities until paid. 

Other deferred compensation plans 

Compensation expense for other deferred compensation plans is recorded on a straight-line basis over the period in which 
employees  perform  services  to  which  the  awards  relate  or  over  the  period  of  the  tranches  for  those  awards  delivered  in 
tranches. For awards that are delivered in tranches, each tranche is considered a separate award and amortized separately. 
The amount recognized is based on the present value of the amount expected to be paid under the respective plan and is 
remeasured at each reporting date. The ultimate cumulative compensation expense recognized equals the cash or the fair 
value of the respective financial instruments delivered. 

Government Grants 

The Group recognizes income from government grants when there is reasonable assurance that it will receive the grant and 
will comply with the conditions attached to the grant. The benefit is recognized in the period in which the grant is intended to 
compensate the Group for related costs and presented as a reduction of the related expense.  

The Group considered the initial benefits that arose from borrowing under TLTRO III as government grant from a below-market 
loan under IAS 20 and recognized subsequent benefits in accordance IFRS 9. Since November 23, 2022, all remaining TLTRO 
III operations are indexed to the average applicable key ECB interest rates. 

For further information on the benefit recognized by the Group from the TLTRO III refinancing program see Note 5 “Net interest 
income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss”. 

Options and forwards on common shares 

Option and forward contracts on Deutsche Bank shares are classified as equity if the number of shares is fixed and physical 
settlement is required. All other contracts in which Deutsche Bank shares are the underlying are recorded as financial assets 
or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

Consolidated statement of cash flows  

For  purposes  of  the  consolidated  statement  of  cash  flows,  the  Group’s  cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  highly  liquid 
investments  that  are  readily  convertible  into  cash  and  which  are  subject  to  an  insignificant  risk  of  change  in  value.  Such 
investments include cash and balances at central banks and demand deposits with banks. 

There are various circumstances in which cash and cash equivalent balances held by an entity are not available for use by 
the  Group.  Examples  include  cash  and  cash  equivalent  balances  held  by  a  subsidiary  that  operates  in  a  country  where 
exchange controls or other legal restrictions apply such that the balances are not available for general use by the Group or its 
subsidiaries. 

The  Group’s  assignment  of  cash  flows  to  the  operating,  investing  or  financing  category  depends  on  the  business  model 
(“management approach”). For the Group the primary operating activity is to manage financial assets and financial liabilities. 
Therefore, the issuance and management of long-term borrowings is a core operating activity which is different than for a non-
financial company, where borrowing is not a principal revenue producing activity and thus is part of the financing category. 

The Group views the issuance of senior long-term debt as an operating activity. Senior long-term debt comprises structured 
notes and asset-backed securities, which are designed and executed by the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank business 
line  segments  and  which  are  revenue  generating  activities.  The  other  component  is  debt  issued  by  Treasury,  which  is 
considered interchangeable with other funding sources. All funding costs are allocated to business activities to establish their 
profitability. 

Cash flows related to subordinated long-term debt and trust preferred securities are viewed differently than those related to 
senior-long term debt because they are managed as an integral part of the Group’s capital, primarily to meet regulatory capital 
requirements. As a result, they are not interchangeable with other operating liabilities, but can only be interchanged with equity 
and thus are considered part of the financing category. 

The amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows do not precisely match the movements in the consolidated 
balance  sheet  from  one  period  to  the  next  as  they  exclude  non-cash  items  such  as  movements  due  to  foreign  exchange 
translation and movements due to changes in the group of consolidated companies. 

Movements in balances carried at  fair value through profit or loss represent all changes affecting the carrying value. This 
includes the effects of market movements and cash inflows and outflows. The movements in balances carried at fair value are 
usually presented in operating cash flows.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

The following are those accounting pronouncements which are relevant to the Group and which have been adopted during 
2023 in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. 

IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts” 

On January 1, 2023, the Group adopted IFRS 17, “Insurance Contracts”, which establishes the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. IFRS 17 replaced IFRS 4 
which has given companies dispensation to carry on accounting for insurance contracts using national accounting standards, 
resulting in a multitude of different approaches. IFRS 17 solves the comparison problems created by IFRS 4 by requiring all 
insurance contracts to be accounted for in a consistent manner, benefiting both investors and insurance companies. Insurance 
obligations will be accounted for using current values – instead of historical cost. The information will be updated regularly, 
providing more useful information to users of financial statements. Based on the Group’s current business activities IFRS 17 
did not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, the Group does not provide the 
transition related disclosures under IFRS 17. 

On January 1, 2023, the Group also adopted amendments to IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts” that (1) addressed concerns and 
implementation challenges that were identified after IFRS 17 was published in 2017 and (2) narrow-scope amendments to the 
transition  requirements  of  IFRS  17  for  entities  that  first  apply  IFRS  17  and  IFRS  9  at  the  same  time.  Neither  of  these 
amendments had a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.  

IAS 12 “Income Taxes” 

On January 1, 2023, the Group adopted amendments to IAS 12 “Income Taxes”. These amendments changed the deferred 
tax treatment related to assets and liabilities in a single transaction such that they introduce an exemption from the initial 
recognition exemption provided in IAS 12.15(b) and IAS 12.24. Accordingly, the initial recognition exemption does not apply 
to  transactions  in  which  both  deductible  and  taxable  temporary  differences  arise  on  initial  recognition  that  result  in  the 
recognition of equal deferred tax assets and liabilities. Neither of these amendments had a material impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements.  

In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) issued Global Anti-Base Erosion 
and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Rules under the Pillar 2 Framework. In May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 “Income 
Taxes” to introduce a mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of 
Pillar 2  model  rules  and  disclosure  requirements.  The  application  of  the  exception  outlined  above  had  to  be  applied 
immediately with the disclosure requirements to be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The 
mandatory  temporary  exception  has  been  applied  and  there  has  been  no  impact  on  the  Group’s  consolidated  financial 
statements. 

IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” 

On January 1, 2023, the Group adopted amendments to IAS 1 and “IFRS Practice Statement 2” that are intended to provide 
guidance on deciding which accounting policies to disclose in financial statements. Accordingly, an entity is now required to 
disclose its material accounting policies instead of its significant accounting policies. The amendments did not have an impact 
on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

02 – Recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements 

New accounting pronouncements 

The following accounting pronouncements were not effective as of December 31, 2023 and therefore have not been applied 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements. 

IFRS 16 “Leases” 

In September 2022, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16 “Leases” that clarify how a seller-lessee subsequently measures 
sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the IFRS 15 requirements to be accounted for as a sale. The amendments are 
effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  January 1,  2024,  with  early  adoption  permitted.  The  amendment  is  not 
expected to have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 

IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” 

In January 2020 and July 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification 
of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current”. The amendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current 
should  be  based  on  rights  that  are  in  existence  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  The  amendments  also  clarify  that  the 
classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability and 
make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services. The 
amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. They will 
not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.  

In October 2022, the IASB issued a further amendment to IAS 1 that modifies the requirements described above on how an 
entity classifies debt and other financial liabilities as current or non-current in particular circumstances. Accordingly, it clarifies 
that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a 
liability as current or non-current. In line with the previous amendments, the new amendments are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments will not have a material impact on the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements.  

IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” 

In August 2023, the IASB issued “Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21)” that contains guidance to specify when 
a currency is exchangeable and how to determine the exchange rate when it is not. It also requires the disclosure of additional 
information when a currency is not exchangeable. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. These amendments have yet to be endorsed by the EU.

03 – Acquisitions and dispositions 

Business combinations 

On April 28, 2023, Deutsche Bank announced that it had reached an agreement on an all-cash offer for the acquisition of 
Numis Corporation Plc (“Numis”). Numis is a leading corporate broking and advisory house in the United Kingdom, providing 
strategic  advice  and  capital  market  connectivity  to  more  than 170  corporate  broking  clients,  including 64 clients  in  the 
FTSE 350, representing almost 20% of the index.  

On  October 13,  2023,  the  acquisition  was  completed  and  Deutsche  Bank  acquired  a  100%  interest  in  Numis  for  a  cash 
purchase price of € 460 million (GBP 397 million).  

The intention to acquire Numis aims to establish a prominent position across UK corporate broking and strategic advisory to 
allow Deutsche Bank to accelerate its  Global Hausbank strategy by unlocking a much deeper engagement with corporate 
clients in the UK. The combination of Deutsche Bank’s UK and Ireland corporate finance business with Numis will be known 
under the new brand, Deutsche Numis. 

Following  the  acquisition  of  Numis,  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities 
assumed as of the acquisition date has been finalized in the fourth quarter 2023 with details included in the table below. The 
fair  value  of  acquired  receivables  equal  gross  contractual  amounts  which  all  relate  to  short  term  trading  activity.  Other 
intangible  assets  identified  in  the  purchase  price  allocation  include  customer  relationships  (€ 56 million)  and  tradename 
(€ 27 million).  Goodwill  of  € 235 million  identified  in  the  purchase  price  allocation  mainly  represent  the  expected  future 
economic benefit of synergies and the value of human capital.

Deutsche  Bank  has  assigned  goodwill  resulting  from  the  Numis  acquisition  to  the  Investment  Bank  cash-generating  unit 
(CGU). Given the valuation of the Investment Bank CGU, following the acquisition, goodwill recognized for Numis is considered 
impaired and was written off in the fourth quarter of 2023 (also refer to Note 23 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets). 

From  the  date  of  acquisition,  Numis  contributed  € 31 million  of  revenues  and  a  € 1 million  net  loss  after  tax  to  the  Group 
results. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the Group’s revenues including Numis would have been 
€ 29.0 billion and profit after tax would have been € 4.9 billion. 

During 2022, the Group did not undertake any acquisitions accounted for as business combinations. 

In the third quarter 2021, the Group had completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Better Payment Germany GmbH, 
a Berlin-based early-stage payment service provider. Through this acquisition, the Group intended to expand its market share 
in payment processing and acceptance. The fair value of the purchase price paid for the acquisition consisted of € 5 million 
cash and an earn-out consideration of € 3 million contingent upon a number of KPIs to be achieved within 3 years following 
the acquisition. As part of the purchase price allocation, the Group recorded goodwill of € 5 million assigned to the Corporate 
Bank CGU. Given the value of the Corporate Bank CGU, the new goodwill was considered impaired and immediately written 
off in 2021.

03 – Acquisitions and dispositions 

Dispositions  

The Group finalized several dispositions of subsidiaries/businesses during 2023, 2022 and 2021. These disposals were mainly 
comprised of businesses the Group had previously classified as held for sale, including the transfer of the digital investment 
platform of DWS as part of its partnership with BlackFin, and the sale of the Italian financial advisors business to Zurich Italy 
in 2022, as well as the transfer of the Global Prime Finance & Electronic Equities platform to BNP Paribas in 2021. For more 
detail, please refer to Note 24 “Non-Current Assets and Disposal Groups Held for Sale”. The total consideration received for 
these  dispositions  (thereof  in  cash)  in  2023,  2022  and  2021  was  € 117 million  (cash  € 99 million),  € 488 million  (cash 
€ 439 million)  and  € 34 million  (cash  € 0 million),  respectively.  The  table  below  shows  the  assets  and  liabilities  that  were

04 – Business segments and related information 

Deutsche Bank’s segmental information has been prepared in accordance with the management approach, which requires 
presentation of the segments on the basis of the internal management reports of the entity which are regularly reviewed by 
the  chief  operating  decision  maker,  which  is  the  Deutsche  Bank  Management  Board,  in  order  to  assess  the  financial 
performance of the business segments and for allocating resources to the business segments. 

Business segments 

Deutsche  Bank’s  segment  reporting  follows  the  organizational  structure  as  reflected  in  the  Group’s  internal  management 
reporting systems, which are the basis for assessing the financial performance of the business segments and for allocating 
resources to them. 

The bank’s business operations are organized under the divisional structure comprising the following corporate divisions: 

–  Corporate Bank 
–  Investment Bank 
–  Private Bank 
–  Asset Management 
–  Corporate & Other 

The Group consists of the following reportable segments: Corporate Bank, Investment Bank, Private Bank, Asset Management 
and Corporate & Other. 

Corporate Bank reports revenues in the categories Corporate Treasury Services, Institutional Client Services and Business 
Banking.  

Investment Bank reports revenues in the categories Fixed Income, Currency Sales & Trading and, Origination & Advisory as 
well as Other.  

Private Bank reports revenues in the categories Private Bank Germany and International Private Bank. Within International 
Private Bank revenues are reported in the categories Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs and Premium Banking. 
By year end 2022, International Private Bank materially completed the wind-down of the majority of legacy assets and liabilities 
associated with Sal. Oppenheim. Remaining assets or liabilities are not expected to have material financial impacts going 
forward and will be included in the normal course of the client segment Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs. The 
associated disclosure of “specific revenues items” was discontinued starting in the first quarter of 2023.  

Asset Management reports revenues in the categories Management Fees, Performance and Transaction Fees and Other.  

Corporate  &  Other includes  revenues, costs  and  resources  held  centrally  that  are not allocated  to  the  individual  business 
segments  as  well  as  valuation  and  timing  differences  that  arise  on  derivatives  used  to  hedge  the  Group’s  balance  sheet. 
These are accounting impacts, and valuation losses are expected to be recovered over time as the underlying instruments 
approach maturity. In addition, Corporate & Other contains financial impacts of legacy portfolios, previously reported as the 
Capital Release Unit. 

As announced in the Annual Report 2022, having fulfilled the Capital Release Unit’s de-risking and cost reduction mandate 
from 2019 through year end 2022, the Capital Release Unit ceased to be reported as a separate segment with effect from the 
first quarter of 2023. The remaining portfolio, resources and employees are reported within the Corporate & Other segment. 
In line with the change, the Core Bank, which previously represented the Group excluding the Capital Release Unit, ceased 
to be reported as of the first quarter of 2023.  

In addition, based on management decisions during the reporting period further divisional changes were introduced.  

The prior years' segmental information is presented in the current structure. 

Measurement of segment profit or loss 

Segment  reporting  requires  a  presentation  of  the  segment  results  based  on  management  reporting  methods,  including  a 
reconciliation between the results of the business segments and the consolidated financial statements, which is presented in 
the “Segment results of operations” section within this note. The information provided about each segment is based on internal 
management reporting about segment profit or loss, assets and other information which is regularly reviewed by the chief 
operating decision maker.

Annual Report 2023 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
04 – Business segments and related information 

Segment assets are presented in the Group’s internal management reporting based on a consolidated view, i.e., the amounts 
do not include intersegment balances. The Group`s internal management reporting does not consider segment liabilities or 
interest expense separately. Similarly, depreciation and amortization, tax expenses and other comprehensive income are not 
presented separately internally and are therefore not disclosed here. 

Non-IFRS  compliant  accounting  methods  used  in  the  Group’s  management  reporting  represent  either  valuation  or 
classification  differences.  The  largest  valuation  differences  relate  to  measurement  at  fair  value  in  management  reporting 
versus measurement at amortized cost under IFRS and to the recognition of trading results from own shares in revenues in 
management  reporting  (in  Investment  Bank)  and  in  equity  under  IFRS.  The  major  classification  difference  relates  to 
noncontrolling  interest,  which  represents  the  net  share  of  minority  shareholders  in  revenues,  provision  for  credit  losses, 
noninterest expenses and income tax expenses. Noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of the profit before tax of 
the businesses in management reporting (with a reversal in Corporate & Other) and a component of net income appropriation 
under IFRS. 

Since the Group’s business activities are diverse in nature and its operations are integrated, certain estimates and judgments 
have been made to apportion revenue and expense items among the business segments.  

The  management  reporting  systems  allocate  the  Group’s  external  net  interest  income  according  to  the  value  of  funding 
consumed or provided by each business segment’s activities, in accordance with the bank’s internal funds transfer pricing 
framework.  Furthermore,  to  retain  comparability  with  those  competitors  that  have  legally  independent  units  with  their  own 
equity  funding,  the  Group  allocates  a  net  notional  interest  benefit  on  its  consolidated  capital,  in  line  with  each  segment’s 
proportion of average shareholders’ equity.  

Management uses certain measures for equity and related ratios as part of its internal reporting system because it believes 
that these measures provide it with a useful indication of the financial performance of the business segments. The Group 
discloses such measures to provide investors and analysts with further insight into how management operates the Group’s 
businesses and to enable them to better understand the Group’s results.  

Allocation of Average Shareholder’s Equity  

Shareholders’ equity is fully allocated to the Group’s segments based on the regulatory capital demand of each segment. 
Regulatory capital demand reflects the combined contribution of each segment to the Groups’ Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) 
ratio, the Groups’ leverage ratio and the Group’s capital loss under stress. Contributions in each of the three dimensions are 
weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint for the Group. Contributions to the CET1 ratio and the 
leverage ratio are measured through risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio exposure. The Group’s capital loss under stress 
is a measure of the Group’s overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. Goodwill and other intangible 
assets are directly attributed to the Group’s segments in order to allow the determination of allocated tangible shareholders’ 
equity and the respective returns. Shareholders’ equity and tangible shareholders’ equity is allocated on a monthly basis and 
averaged across quarters and for the full year.  

Driver-Based Cost Management allocations methodology change 

As disclosed in the Annual Report 2022, the Group implemented the Driver-Based Cost Management allocations from the first 
quarter of 2023. The new methodology aims to provide greater transparency over the drivers of infrastructure costs and links 
costs more closely to service consumption by segments. This change did not affect the Group’s cost/income ratio and return 
on tangible equity metrics but does impact these per business segment. Therefore prior-period information is presented in the 
current structure, resulting in an increase in noninterest expenses (corresponding decrease in profit before tax) for Corporate 
Bank  of  € 276 million,  for  Investment  Bank  of  € 239 million,  for  Private  Bank  of  € 279 million,  for  Asset  Management  of 
€ 15 million, with a corresponding decrease in noninterest expenses (corresponding reduction in loss before tax) for Corporate 
& Other of € 809 million for the full year 2022.  

Strategic Liquidity Reserve Profit and Loss Allocation 

Commencing from the first quarter of 2022, the methodology for divisional intra-year allocations of profit or loss earned on the 
Strategic Liquidity Reserves has been refined. As part of the introduction of the new methodology, the intra-year profit and 
loss  volatility  is  held  centrally  in  Corporate  &  Other  in  order  to  better  reflect  the  underlying  performance  of  the  business 
divisions. The implementation of the new methodology does not impact the overall group revenues or the annual business 
allocations, therefore the full year results for 2022 and 2021 are not impacted.

04 – Business segments and related information 

U.S. Tax Exempt Securities 

Net interest income as a component of net revenues, profit (loss) before tax and related ratios are presented on a fully taxable-
equivalent basis for U.S. tax-exempt securities for the Investment Bank. This enables management to measure performance 
of taxable and tax-exempt securities on a comparable basis. This presentation resulted in an increase in Investment Bank net 
interest income of € 10 million for full year 2023, € 33 million for full year 2022 and € 40 million for full year 2021. This increase 
is offset in Group consolidated figures through a reversal in Corporate & Other. The tax rate used in determining the fully 
taxable-equivalent of net interest income in respect of the majority of the U.S. tax-exempt securities is 21% for 2023, 2022 
and 2021. 

Infrastructure Full-time Employees realignment  

In the third quarter of 2021, approximately 9,000 FTEs moved from Corporate & Other to the operating business segments 
driven  by  the  bank’s  decision  that  the  Chief  Operating  Office  will  no  longer  be  a  separate  Management  Board  function. 
Accordingly, business-related parts of Chief Operating Office that support the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank, which 
were  previously  run  in  Infrastructure,  moved  to  those  divisions.  Comparative  segmental  financial  information  is  presented 
accordingly. This change did not result in a material financial impact at a segment level, as costs are allocated from Corporate 
& Other to the operating business segments that are using the service of the respective infrastructure functions and with this 
move the costs are directly incurred by the divisions rather than being charged to Corporate & Other.

3  The leverage ratio exposure is calculated according to CRR as applicable at the reporting date; starting with September 30, 2020, the Group was allowed to exclude certain 
Euro-based exposures facing Eurosystem central banks from the leverage ratio exposure based on the ECB-decision (EU) 2020/1306 and EU 2021/1074; this exclusion 
applied until March 31, 2022; the segmental leverage exposures are presented without that exclusion

Entity-wide disclosures 

The Group’s entity-wide disclosures include net revenues from internal and external counterparties. Excluding revenues from 
internal counterparties would require disproportionate IT investment and is not in line with the Bank's management approach. 
For  details  of  the  net revenue  components  please  see  “Management  Report:  Operating  and  Financial  Review:  Results  of 
Operations: Corporate Divisions”. 

The following table presents total net revenues (before provision for credit losses) by geographic area for the years ended 
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 respectively. The information presented for Corporate Bank, Investment Bank, Private 
Bank and Asset Management has been classified based primarily on the location of the Group’s office in which the revenues 
are recorded. The information for Corporate & Other is presented on a global level only, as management responsibility for 
Corporate & Other is held centrally.

Prior year’s comparatives aligned to presentation in the current year 
1  Consolidated net revenues comprise interest and similar income, interest expenses and total noninterest income (including net commission and fee income);  revenues are 
attributed to countries based on the location in which the Group’s booking office is located; the location of a transaction on the Group’s books is sometimes different from the 
location of the headquarters or other offices of a customer and different from the location of the Group’s personnel who entered into or facilitated the transaction; where the

Impact of ECB Targeted Longer-term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III 
program) 

The  Governing  Council  of  the  ECB  decided  on  a  number  of  modifications  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  its  TLTRO III-
refinancing program starting in the second quarter of 2020 in order to support funding of credit to households and firms and 
the economic disruption due to COVID-19. The Group considered the initial benefits that arose from borrowing under TLTRO III 
as government grant from a below-market loan under IAS 20 and recognizes subsequent benefits in accordance IFRS 9. The 
current interest rate on all remaining TLTRO III operations is indexed on the average applicable key ECB interest rates from 
November  23,  2022,  onward.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  Group  has  borrowed  € 15.0 billion  (December  31,  2022: 
€ 33.7 billion) under the TLTRO III-refinancing program. The resulting net interest income (expense) includes € (741) million 
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: € 211 million) under the TLTRO III program.

Combined net interest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 

The Group’s trading and risk management businesses include significant activities in interest rate instruments and related 
derivatives. Under IFRS, interest and similar income earned from trading instruments and financial instruments designated at 
fair value through profit or loss (i.e., coupon and dividend income), and the costs of funding net trading positions, are part of 
net interest income. The Group’s trading activities can periodically shift income to either net interest income or to net gains 
(losses)  of  financial  assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  depending  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  risk 
management strategies. The above table combines net interest income and net gains (losses) of financial assets/liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss by business division.

Prior year’s comparatives aligned to presentation in the current year 

Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. Performance obligation is satisfied by fund performance 
exceeding  a  hurdle  rate,  an  agreed  minimum  annual  return  provided  to  investors.  As  of  31  December  2023,  there  were 
performance obligations to be satisfied of € 225 million with a time band of three years from 2025 to 2027 (as of 31 December 
2022, € 267 million with a time band of three years from 2024 to 2026) from Alternative funds. The decrease of performance 
obligations to be satisfied was mainly driven by decline in the real estate valuations due to market conditions. 

As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Group’s balance of receivables from commission and fee income was 
€ 903 million  and  € 798 million  respectively.  As  of  December 31,  2023,  and  December 31,  2022,  the  Group’s  balance  of 
contract liabilities associated to commission and fee income was € 90 million and € 63 million, respectively. Contract liabilities 
arise from the Group’s obligation to provide future services to a customer for which it has received consideration from the 
customer prior to completion of the services. The balances of receivables and contract liabilities do not vary significantly from 
period to period reflecting the fact that they predominately relate to recurring service contracts with service periods of less 
than one year such as monthly current account services and quarterly asset management services. As a result, prior period 
balances of contract liabilities are generally recognized in revenue in the subsequent period. Customer payment in exchange 
for services provided are generally subject to performance by the Group over the specific service period such that the Group’s 
right to payment arises at the end of the service period when its performance obligations are fully completed. Therefore, no

10 – Restructuring 

In 2023, Restructuring is primarily driven by the implementation of the Group’s Global Hausbank strategic agenda. The Group 
has defined and is in the process of implementing efficiency measures that aim to contribute to achieving the bank’s 2025 
targets. Restructuring in prior periods relates to measures as part of the previous strategy “Compete to win” which the bank 
continues to implement. 

Restructuring  expense  is  comprised  of  termination  benefits,  additional  expenses  covering  the  acceleration  of  deferred 
compensation awards not yet amortized due to the discontinuation of employment and contract termination costs related to 
real estate.

11 – Earnings per share 

11 – Earnings per share  

Basic earnings per share amounts are computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders by 
the average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The average number of common shares outstanding is 
defined as the average number of common shares issued, reduced by the average number of shares in treasury and by the 
average  number  of  shares  that  will  be  acquired  under  physically-settled  forward  purchase  contracts,  and  increased  by 
undistributed vested shares awarded under deferred share plans. 

Diluted earnings per share assumes the conversion into common shares of outstanding securities or other contracts to issue 
common  stock,  such  as  share  options,  convertible  debt,  unvested  deferred  share  awards  and  forward  contracts.  The 
aforementioned  instruments  are  only  included  in  the  calculation  of  diluted  earnings  per  share  if  they  are  dilutive  in  the 
respective reporting period.

12 – Financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 

Financial assets & liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss 

The Group has designated various lending relationships at fair value through profit or loss. Lending facilities consist of drawn 
loan assets and undrawn irrevocable loan commitments. The maximum exposure to credit risk on a drawn loan is its fair value. 
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on drawn loans was € 75 million and € 168 million as of December 31, 2023, 
and 2022, respectively. Exposure to credit risk also exists for undrawn irrevocable loan commitments and is predominantly 
counterparty credit risk. 

The credit risk on the securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed designated under the fair value 
option is mitigated by the holding of collateral. The valuation of these instruments considers the credit enhancement in the 
form of the collateral received. As such there is no material movement during the year or cumulatively due to movements in 
counterparty credit risk on these instruments.

Valuation methods and control 

The  Group  has  an  established  valuation  control  framework  which  governs  internal  control  standards,  methodologies,  and 
procedures over the valuation process.  

Prices Quoted in Active Markets – The fair value of instruments that are quoted in active markets are determined using the 
quoted prices where they represent prices at which regularly and recently occurring transactions take place. 

Valuation Techniques – The Group uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of instruments where prices, quoted 
in active markets, are not available. Valuation techniques used for financial instruments include modelling techniques, the use 
of indicative quotes for proxy instruments, quotes from recent and less regular transactions and broker quotes. 

For some financial instruments a rate or other parameter, rather than a price, is quoted. Where this is the case then the market 
rate or parameter is used as an input to a valuation model to determine fair value. For some instruments, modelling techniques 
follow  industry  standard  models,  for  example,  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  and  standard  option  pricing  models.  These 
models are dependent upon estimated future cash flows, discount factors and volatility levels. For more complex or unique 
instruments,  more  sophisticated  modelling  techniques  are  required,  and  may  rely  upon  assumptions  or  more  complex 
parameters such as correlations, prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity. 

Frequently, valuation models require multiple parameter inputs. Where possible, parameter inputs are based on observable 
data or are derived from the prices of relevant instruments traded in active markets. Where observable data is not available 
for  parameter  inputs,  then  other  market  information  is  considered.  For  example,  indicative  broker  quotes  and  consensus 
pricing  information  are  used  to  support  parameter  inputs  where  they  are  available.  Where  no  observable  information  is 
available to support parameter inputs then they are based on other relevant sources of information such as prices for similar 
transactions, historic data, economic fundamentals, and research information, with appropriate adjustment to reflect the terms 
of the actual instrument being valued and current market conditions. 

Valuation Adjustments – Valuation adjustments are an integral part of the valuation process. In making appropriate valuation 
adjustments, the Group follows methodologies that consider factors such as bid-offer spreads, counterparty/own credit and 
funding risk. Bid offer spread valuation adjustments are required to adjust mid-market valuations to the appropriate bid or offer 
valuation. The bid or offer valuation is the best representation of the fair value for an instrument. The carrying value of a long 
position is adjusted from mid to bid, and the carrying value of a short position is adjusted from mid to offer. Bid-offer valuation 
adjustments are determined from bid-offer prices observed in relevant trading activity and in quotes from other broker-dealers 
or other knowledgeable counterparties. Where the quoted price for the instrument is already a bid-offer price then no additional 
bid-offer valuation adjustment is necessary. Where the fair value of financial instruments is derived from a modelling technique, 
then the parameter inputs into that model are normally at a mid-market level. Such instruments are generally managed on a 
portfolio basis and, when specified criteria are met, valuation adjustments are taken to reflect the cost of closing out the net 
exposure the Bank has to individual market or counterparty risks. These adjustments are determined from bid-offer prices 
observed in relevant trading activity and quotes from other broker-dealers. 

Where complex valuation models are used, or where less-liquid positions are being valued, then bid-offer levels for those 
positions may not be available directly from the market, and therefore for the close-out cost of these positions, models and 
parameters  must  be  estimated.  When  these  adjustments  are  designed,  the  Group  closely  examines  the  valuation  risks 
associated with the model as well as the positions themselves, and the resulting adjustments are closely monitored on an 
ongoing basis. 

Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs) are required to cover expected credit losses to the extent that the valuation 
technique does not already include an expected credit loss factor relating to the non-performance risk of the counterparty. The 
CVA amount is applied to all relevant over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and is determined by assessing the potential credit 
exposure to a given counterparty and taking into account any collateral held, the effect of any relevant netting arrangements, 
expected loss  given  default  and  the  probability  of  default,  based  on  available  market  information,  including  Credit  Default 
Swap (CDS) spreads. Where counterparty CDS spreads are not available, relevant proxies are used.  

The fair value of the Group’s financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (i.e., OTC derivative liabilities and issued 
note liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss) incorporates valuation adjustments to measure the change in the 
Group’s own credit risk (i.e. Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) for Derivatives and Own Credit Adjustment (OCA) for issued 
note liabilities). Issued note liabilities are discounted utilizing the spread at which similar instruments would be traded as at 
the measurement date as this reflects the value from the perspective of a market participant who holds the identical item as 
an asset. The change in this own credit component is reported under Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).

Annual Report 2023 

Notes to the consolidated balance sheet 
13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value 

For derivative liabilities the Group considers its own creditworthiness by assessing all counterparties expected future exposure 
to the Group, taking into account any collateral posted by the Group, the effect of relevant netting arrangements, the market 
price  of  the  Group’s  issued  note  liabilities,  the  market  implied  funding  costs  and  the  seniority  of  derivative  claims  under 
resolution (statutory subordination). 

When  determining  CVA  and  DVA,  additional  adjustments  are  made  where  appropriate  to  achieve  fair  value,  due  to  the 
expected loss estimate of a particular arrangement, or where the credit risk being assessed differs in nature to that described 
by the available CDS instrument. 

Funding  Valuation  Adjustments  (FVA)  are  required  to  incorporate  the  market  implied  funding  costs  into  the  fair  value  of 
derivative positions. The FVA reflects a discounting spread applied to uncollateralized and partially collateralized derivatives 
and is determined by assessing the market-implied funding costs on both assets and liabilities.  

Where there is uncertainty in the assumptions used within a modelling technique, an additional adjustment is taken to calibrate 
the model price to the expected market price of the financial instrument. Typically, such transactions have bid-offer levels 
which are less observable, and these adjustments aim to estimate the bid-offer by computing the liquidity-premium associated 
with the transaction. Where a financial instrument is of sufficient complexity that the cost of closing it out would be higher than 
the cost of closing out its component risks, then an additional adjustment is taken to reflect this. 

The Group uses the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Where relevant, these 
assumptions may include assumptions about climate change. The Group has not made material adjustment to fair value for 
climate change beyond that already priced into market inputs. 

Valuation Control – The Group has an independent specialized valuation control group within the Risk function which governs 
and develops the valuation control framework and manages the valuation control processes. The mandate of this specialist 
function includes the performance of the independent valuation control process for all businesses, the continued development 
of  valuation  control  methodologies  and  techniques,  as  well  as  devising  and  governing  the  formal  valuation  control  policy 
framework. Special attention of this independent valuation control group is directed to areas where management judgment 
forms part of the valuation process. 

Results of the valuation control process are collected and analyzed as part of a standard monthly reporting cycle. Variances 
of differences outside of preset and approved tolerance levels are escalated both within the Finance function and with Senior 
Business Management for review, resolution and, if required, adjustment.  

For instruments where fair value is determined from valuation models, the assumptions and techniques used within the models 
are independently validated by an independent specialist model validation group that is part of the Group’s Risk Management 
function.  

Quotes for transactions and parameter inputs are obtained from a number of third party sources including exchanges, pricing 
service providers, firm broker quotes and consensus pricing services. Price sources are examined and assessed to determine 
the quality of fair value information they represent, with greater emphasis given to those possessing greater valuation certainty 
and  relevance.  The  results  are  compared  against  actual  transactions  in  the  market  to  ensure  the  model  valuations  are 
calibrated to market prices.  

Price  and  parameter  inputs  to  models,  assumptions  and  valuation  adjustments  are  verified  against  independent  sources. 
Where they  cannot be  verified  to  independent sources due  to lack  of  observable  information,  the  estimate  of  fair value  is 
subject  to  procedures to  assess  its  reasonableness. Such  procedures  include  performing  revaluation  using  independently 
generated  models  (including  where  existing  models  are  independently  recalibrated),  assessing  the  valuations  against 
appropriate proxy instruments and other benchmarks, and performing extrapolation techniques. Assessment is made as to 
whether the valuation techniques produce fair value estimates that are reflective of market levels by calibrating the results of 
the valuation models against market transactions where possible.

13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value 

Valuation techniques  

The Group has an established valuation control framework which governs internal control standards, methodologies, valuation 
techniques and procedures over the valuation process and fair value measurement. The current market conditions including 
the ongoing macro-economic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties required additional focus and review in certain areas, 
during the year 2023 including assessment of bid-offer spreads to ensure they are representative of fair value. 

The following is an explanation of the valuation techniques used in establishing the fair value of the different types of financial 
instruments that the Group trades. 

Sovereign, Quasi-sovereign and Corporate Debt and Equity Securities – Where there are no recent transactions then fair 
value may be determined from the last market price adjusted for all changes in risks and information since that date. Where a 
close proxy instrument is quoted in an active market then fair value is determined by adjusting the proxy value for differences 
in the risk profile of the instruments. Where close proxies are not available then fair value is estimated using more complex 
modelling techniques. These techniques include discounted cash flow models using current market rates for credit, interest, 
liquidity and other risks. For equity securities modeling techniques may also include those based on earnings multiples. 

Mortgage- and Other Asset-Backed Securities (MBS/ABS) include residential and commercial MBS and other ABS including 
Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO). ABS have specific characteristics as they have different underlying assets, and the 
issuing entities have different capital structures. The complexity increases further where the underlying assets are themselves 
ABS, as is the case with many of the CDO instruments. 

Where no reliable external pricing is available, ABS are valued, where applicable, using either relative value analysis which is 
performed  based  on  similar  transactions  observable  in  the  market,  or  industry-standard  valuation  models  making  largest 
possible  use  of  available  observable inputs.  The  industry standard  models  calculate  principal  and interest payments  for a 
given  deal  based  on  assumptions  that  can  be  independently  price  tested.  The  inputs  include  prepayment  speeds,  loss 
assumptions  (timing  and  severity)  and  a  discount  rate  (spread,  yield  or  discount  margin).  These  inputs/assumptions  are 
derived from actual transactions, external market research and market indices where appropriate. 

Loans – For certain loans fair value may be determined from the market price on a recently occurring transaction adjusted for 
all changes in risks and information since that transaction date. Where there are no recent market transactions then broker 
quotes, consensus pricing, proxy instruments or discounted cash flow models are used to determine fair value. Discounted 
cash  flow  models  incorporate  parameter  inputs  for  credit  risk,  interest  rate  risk,  foreign  exchange  risk,  loss  given  default 
estimates  and  amounts  utilized  given  default,  as  appropriate.  Credit  risk,  loss  given  default  and  utilization  given  default 
parameters are determined using information from the loan or CDS markets, where available and appropriate.  

Leveraged loans can have transaction-specific characteristics which can limit the relevance of market-observed transactions. 
Where similar transactions exist for which observable quotes are available from external pricing services then this information 
is used with appropriate adjustments to reflect the transaction differences. When no similar transactions exist, a discounted 
cash flow valuation technique is used with credit spreads derived from the appropriate leveraged loan index, incorporating the 
industry classification, subordination of the loan, and any other relevant information on the loan and loan counterparty. 

Over-The-Counter Derivative Financial Instruments – Market standard transactions in liquid trading markets, such as interest 
rate swaps, foreign exchange forward and option contracts in G7 currencies, and equity swap and option contracts on listed 
securities or indices are valued using market standard models and quoted parameter inputs. Parameter inputs are obtained 
from pricing services, consensus pricing services and recently occurring transactions in active markets wherever possible.  

More complex instruments are modeled using more sophisticated modeling techniques specific for the instrument and are 
calibrated to available market prices. Where the model output value does not calibrate to a relevant market reference then 
valuation adjustments are made to the model output value to adjust for any difference. In less active markets, data is obtained 
from  less  frequent  market  transactions,  broker  quotes  and  through  extrapolation  and  interpolation  techniques.  Where 
observable prices or inputs are not available, management judgment is required to determine fair values by assessing other 
relevant sources of information such as historical data, fundamental analysis of the economics of the transaction and proxy 
information from similar transactions.

13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value 

Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss under the Fair Value Option – The fair value of financial 
liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option incorporates all market risk factors including 
a measure of the Group’s credit risk relevant for that financial liability (i.e., own credit adjustment (OCA) for structured notes). 
Under IFRS 9, the own credit component of change in the fair value is reported under Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). 
Financial  liabilities  included  in  this  classification  are  structured  note  issuances,  structured  deposits,  and  other  structured 
securities  issued  by  consolidated  vehicles.  The  fair  value  of  these  financial  liabilities  is  determined  by  discounting  the 
contractual  cash  flows  using  the  relevant  credit-adjusted  yield  curve (i.e.,  utilizing  the  spread  at  which  similar  instruments 
would be traded as at the measurement date as this reflects the value from the perspective of a market participant who holds 
the identical item as an asset). 

Where the financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option are collateralized, such 
as  securities  loaned  and  securities  sold  under  repurchase  agreements,  the  credit  enhancement  is  factored  into  the  fair 
valuation of the liability. 

Investment Contract Liabilities – Assets which are linked to the investment contract liabilities are owned by the Group. The 
investment contract obliges the Group to use these assets to settle these liabilities. Therefore, the fair value of investment 
contract liabilities is determined by the fair value of the underlying assets (i.e., amount payable on surrender of the policies). 

Fair value hierarchy 

The financial instruments carried at fair value have been categorized under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy 
as follows: 

Level 1 – Instruments valued using quoted prices in active markets are instruments where the fair value can be determined 
directly from prices which are quoted in active, liquid markets. 

These include: government bonds, exchange-traded derivatives and equity securities traded on active, liquid exchanges.  

Level 2 – Instruments valued with valuation techniques using observable market data are instruments where the fair value 
can be determined by reference to similar instruments trading in active markets, or where a technique is used to derive the 
valuation but where all significant inputs to that technique are observable.  

These include: many OTC derivatives, many investment-grade listed credit bonds, some CDS. 

Level 3 – Instruments valued using valuation techniques using market data which is not directly observable are instruments 
where the fair value cannot be determined directly by reference to market-observable information, and some other pricing 
technique must be employed. Instruments classified in this category have an input to that technique which is unobservable, 
and which can have a significant impact on the fair value. 

These  include:  more-complex  OTC  derivatives,  distressed  debt,  highly-structured  bonds,  illiquid  asset-backed  securities 
(ABS), illiquid CDO’s (cash and synthetic), some private equity placements, many commercial real estate (CRE) loans, illiquid 
loans, and some municipal bonds.

1  Amounts in this table are generally presented on a gross basis, in line with the Group’s accounting policy regarding offsetting of financial instruments, as described in Note 1 

“Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates” 

2  Predominantly relates to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting 
3  Relates to derivatives which are embedded in contracts where the host contract is held at amortized cost but for which the embedded derivative is separated. The separated 

embedded derivatives may have a positive or a negative fair value but have been presented in this table to be consistent with the classification of the host contract. The 
separated embedded derivatives are held at fair value on a recurring basis and have been split between the fair value hierarchy classifications 

During the year 2023, there were transfers in trading securities from Level 1 to Level 2 amounting to € 6 billion of assets and 
€ 2 billion of liabilities; along with transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 of  € 11 billion in assets and € 3 billion in liabilities. The 
assessment of Level 1 versus Level 2 is based on liquidity testing procedures. 

Analysis of financial instruments with fair value derived from valuation techniques 
containing significant unobservable parameters (Level 3) 

Some of the financial assets and financial liabilities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy have identical or similar offsetting 
exposures to the unobservable input. However, according to IFRS they are required to be presented gross. 

Trading  Securities  –  Certain  illiquid  emerging  market  corporate  bonds  and  illiquid  highly  structured  corporate  bonds  are 
included in this level of the hierarchy. In addition, some of the holdings of notes issued by securitization entities, commercial 
and residential MBS, collateralized debt obligation securities and other ABS are reported here. The increase in the period is 
driven by purchases and issuances, gains and net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability 
of input parameters used to value these instruments, partially offset by sales and settlements.

13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value 

Positive and Negative Market Values from Derivative Instruments categorized in this level of the fair value hierarchy are valued 
based on one or more significant unobservable parameters. The unobservable parameters may include certain correlations, 
certain longer-term volatilities, certain prepayment rates, credit spreads and other transaction-specific parameters.  

Level 3 derivatives include certain options where the volatility is unobservable; certain basket options in which the correlations 
between  the  referenced  underlying  assets  are  unobservable;  longer-term  interest  rate  option  derivatives;  multi-currency 
foreign exchange derivatives; and certain credit default swaps for which the credit spread is not observable.  

The  decrease  in  assets during  the  period  are  driven  by  net transfers  between  Level 2  and  Level 3  due  to  changes  in  the 
observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements, partially offset by gains. The decrease in 
liabilities during the period are driven by net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input 
parameters used to value these instruments and settlements, partially offset by losses. 

Other Trading Instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy mainly consist of traded loans valued using valuation 
models based on one or more significant unobservable parameters. The increase in the period is driven by purchases and 
issuances, net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value 
these instruments and gains partially offset by sales and settlements.  

Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss classified in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy include 
any non-trading financial asset that does not fall into the Hold to Collect nor Hold to Collect and Sell business models. This 
includes predominately reverse repurchase agreements which are managed on a fair value basis. Additionally, any financial 
asset  that  falls  into  the  Hold  to  Collect  or  Hold  to  Collect  and  Sell  business  models  for  which  the  contractual  cash  flow 
characteristics are not SPPI. The decrease in the period is driven by settlements and sales, net transfers between Level 2 
and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and losses, partially offset 
by purchases and issuances. 

Financial Assets/Liabilities designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss – Certain corporate loans and structured liabilities 
which were designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option were categorized in this level of the fair 
value  hierarchy.  The  corporate  loans  are  valued  using  valuation  techniques  which  incorporate  observable  credit  spreads, 
recovery rates and unobservable utilization parameters. Revolving loan facilities are reported in the third level of the hierarchy 
because the utilization in the event of the default parameter is significant and unobservable. 

In addition, certain hybrid debt issuances designated at fair value through profit or loss containing embedded derivatives are 
valued  based  on  significant  unobservable  parameters.  These  unobservable  parameters  include  single  stock  volatility 
correlations. The decrease in assets during the period is driven by settlements. The increase in liabilities during the period is 
driven by issuances and losses partially offset by net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability 
of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements. 

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include non-performing loan portfolios where there is no 
trading intent, and the market is very illiquid. The increase in the period is driven by purchases and issuances, partially offset 
by sales and settlements, net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the observability of input parameters 
used to value these instruments and losses.

1  Total gains and losses predominantly relate to net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss reported in the consolidated statement of 

income. The balance also includes net gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income reported in the consolidated statement of income 
and unrealized net gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and exchange rate changes reported in other comprehensive income, 
net of tax. Further, certain instruments are hedged with instruments in level 1 or level 2 but the table above does not include the gains and losses on these hedging 
instruments. Additionally, both observable and unobservable parameters may be used to determine the fair value of an instrument classified within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy; the gains and losses presented below are attributable to movements in both the observable and unobservable parameters 

2  Issuances relate to the cash amount received on the issuance of a liability and the cash amount paid on the primary issuance of a loan to a borrower 
3  Settlements represent cash flows to settle the asset or liability. For debt and loan instruments this includes principal on maturity, principal amortizations and principal 

repayments. For derivatives all cash flows are presented in settlements 

4  Transfers in and transfers out of Level 3 are related to changes in observability of input parameters. During the year they are recorded at their fair value at the beginning of 

year. For instruments transferred into Level 3 the table shows the gains and losses and cash flows on the instruments as if they had been transferred at the beginning of the 
year. Similarly, for instruments transferred out of Level 3 the table does not show any gains or losses or cash flows on the instruments during the year since the table is 
presented as if they have been transferred out at the beginning of the year 

5  Total gains and losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include a loss of € 17 million recognized in other comprehensive income, net of 

tax and a loss of € 3 million recognized in the income statement presented in net gains (losses) 

6  This amount includes the effect of exchange rate changes. For total financial assets held at fair value this effect is a loss of € 273 million and for total financial liabilities held at

1  Total gains and losses predominantly relate to net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss reported in the consolidated statement of 

income. The balance also includes net gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income reported in the consolidated statement of income 
and unrealized net gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and exchange rate changes reported in other comprehensive income, 
net of tax. Further, certain instruments are hedged with instruments in level 1 or level 2 but the table above does not include the gains and losses on these hedging 
instruments. Additionally, both observable and unobservable parameters may be used to determine the fair value of an instrument classified within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy; the gains and losses presented below are attributable to movements in both the observable and unobservable parameters 

2  Issuances relate to the cash amount received on the issuance of a liability and the cash amount paid on the primary issuance of a loan to a borrower 
3  Settlements represent cash flows to settle the asset or liability. For debt and loan instruments this includes principal on maturity, principal amortizations and principal 

repayments. For derivatives all cash flows are presented in settlements 

4  Transfers in and transfers out of Level 3 are related to changes in observability of input parameters. During the year they are recorded at their fair value at the beginning of 

year. For instruments transferred into Level 3 the table shows the gains and losses and cash flows on the instruments as if they had been transferred at the beginning of the 
year. Similarly, for instruments transferred out of Level 3 the table does not show any gains or losses or cash flows on the instruments during the year since the table is 
presented as if they have been transferred out at the beginning of the year 

5  Total gains and losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include a loss of € 189 million recognized in other comprehensive income, net of 

tax and a loss of € 2 million recognized in the income statement presented in net gains (losses) 

6  This amount includes the effect of exchange rate changes. For total financial assets held at fair value this effect is a gain of € 425 million and for total financial liabilities held at 

fair value this is a loss of € 35 million 

7  For assets positive balances represent gains, negative balances represent losses. For liabilities positive balances represent losses, negative balances represent gains 

Sensitivity analysis of unobservable parameters 

Where  the  value  of  financial  instruments  is  dependent  on  unobservable  parameter  inputs,  the  precise  level  for  these 
parameters  at  the  balance  sheet  date  might  be  drawn  from  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  alternatives.  In  preparing  the 
financial statements, appropriate levels for these unobservable input parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with 
prevailing market evidence and in line with the Group’s approach to valuation control detailed above.  

The Group’s sensitivity calculation of unobservable parameters for Level 3 aligns to the approach used to assess valuation 
uncertainty for prudent valuation purposes. Prudent valuation is a capital requirement for assets held at fair value. It provides 
a mechanism for quantifying and capitalizing valuation uncertainty in accordance with the European Commission Delegated 
Regulation  (EU)  2016/101,  which  supplements  Article 34  of  Regulation  (EU) No.  2019/876 (CRR),  requiring  institutions  to 
apply the requirements of Article 105 (14) to all assets measured at fair value and to deduct any additional value adjustments 
from CET1 capital. This utilizes an exit price analysis performed for the relevant assets and liabilities in the Prudent Valuation 
assessment.

13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value 

If the Group marked Level 3 financial instruments using parameter values drawn from the extremes of the ranges of reasonably 
possible alternatives, as of December 31, 2023 it could have increased fair value by as much as € 1.8 billion or decreased fair 
value by as much as € 1.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022 it could have increased fair value by as much as € 2.0 billion or 
decreased fair value by as much as € 1.4 billion.  

The changes in sensitive amounts from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 were a reduction in positive fair value 
movement of € 169 million, and a reduction in negative fair value movement of € 79 million.  

The reductions in positive and negative fair value movements are directionally aligned with the reduction in Group Level 3 in 
the period, with Level 3 assets moving from € 26.7 billion at December 31, 2022 to € 25.6 billion at December 31, 2023. 

The change in positive fair value movements from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 represents an 9% reduction 
and the change in negative fair value movements represents an 6% reduction. 

This disclosure is intended to illustrate the potential impact of the relative uncertainty in the fair value of financial instruments 
for which valuation is dependent on unobservable input parameters. However, it is unlikely in practice that all unobservable 
parameters would be simultaneously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible alternatives. 

For many of the financial instruments considered here, in particular derivatives, unobservable input parameters represent only 
a  subset  of  the  parameters  required  to  price  the  financial  instrument,  the  remainder  being  observable.  Hence,  for  these 
instruments the overall impact of moving the unobservable input parameters to the extremes of their ranges might be relatively 
small compared with the total fair value of the financial instrument. For other instruments, fair value is determined based on 
the price of the entire instrument, for example, by adjusting the fair value of a reasonable proxy instrument. In addition, all 
financial instruments are already carried at fair values which are inclusive of valuation adjustments for the cost to close out 
that instrument and hence already factor in uncertainty as it reflects itself in market pricing. Any negative impact of uncertainty 
calculated within this disclosure, then, will be over and above that already included in the fair value contained in the financial 
statements.

13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value 

Quantitative information about the sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs 

The behavior of the unobservable parameters on Level 3 fair value measurement is not necessarily independent, and dynamic 
relationships  often  exist  between  the  other  unobservable  parameters  and  the  observable  parameters.  Such  relationships, 
where  material  to  the  fair  value  of  a  given  instrument,  are  explicitly  captured  via  correlation  parameters,  or  are  otherwise 
controlled via pricing models or valuation techniques. Frequently, where a valuation technique utilizes more than one input, 
the choice of a certain input will bound the range of possible values for other inputs. In addition, broader market factors (such 
as interest rates, equity, credit or commodity indices or foreign exchange rates) can also have effects. 

The range of values shown below represents the highest and lowest inputs used to value the significant exposures within 
Level 3. The diversity of financial instruments that make up the disclosure is significant and therefore the ranges of certain 
parameters can be large. For example, the range of credit spreads on mortgage-backed securities represents performing, 
more liquid positions with lower spreads than the less liquid, non-performing positions which will have higher credit spreads. 
As Level 3 contains the less liquid fair value instruments, the wide ranges of parameters seen is to be expected, as there is a 
high degree of pricing differentiation within each exposure type to capture the relevant market dynamics. The table below 
provides a brief description of each of the principal parameter types, along with a commentary on significant interrelationships 
between them. 

Credit Parameters are used to assess the creditworthiness of an exposure, by enabling the probability of default and resulting 
losses  of  a  default  to  be  represented.  The  credit  spread  is  the  primary  reflection  of  creditworthiness  and  represents  the 
premium  or  yield  return  above  the  benchmark  reference  instrument  (typically  LIBOR,  or  relevant  Treasury  Instrument, 
depending upon the asset being assessed), that a bond holder would require to allow for the credit quality difference between 
that entity and the reference benchmark. Higher credit spreads will indicate lower credit quality, and lead to a lower value for 
a given bond, or other loan-asset that is to be repaid to the Bank by the borrower. Recovery Rates represent an estimate of 
the amount a lender would receive in the case of a default of a loan, or a bond holder would receive in the case of default of 
the bond. Higher recovery rates will give a higher valuation for a given bond position, if other parameters are held constant. 
Constant Default Rate and Constant Prepayment Rate allow more complex loan and debt assets to be assessed, as these 
parameters estimate the ongoing defaults arising on scheduled repayments and coupons, or whether the borrower is making 
additional (usually voluntary) prepayments. These parameters are particularly relevant when forming a fair value opinion for 
mortgage or other types of lending, where repayments are delivered by the borrower through time, or where the borrower may 
pre-pay the loan (seen for example in some residential mortgages). Higher Constant Default Rate will lead to lower valuation 
of a given loan or mortgage as the lender will ultimately receive less cash.  

Interest  rates,  credit  spreads,  inflation  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates  and  equity  prices  are  referenced  in  some  option 
instruments,  or  other  complex  derivatives,  where  the  payoff  a  holder  of  the  derivative  will  receive  is  dependent  upon  the 
behavior  of  these  underlying  references  through  time.  Volatility  parameters  describe  key  attributes  of  option  behavior  by 
enabling the variability of returns of the underlying instrument to be assessed. This volatility is a measure of probability, with 
higher volatilities denoting higher probabilities of a particular outcome occurring. The underlying references (interest rates, 
credit spreads etc.) have an effect on the valuation of options, by describing the size of the return that can be expected from 
the option. Therefore, the value of a given option is dependent upon the value of the underlying instrument, and the volatility 
of that instrument, representing the size of the payoff, and the probability of that payoff occurring. Where volatilities are high, 
the option holder will see a higher option value as there is greater probability of positive returns. A higher option value will also 
occur where the payoff described by the option is significant.  

Correlations  are  used  to  describe  influential  relationships  between  underlying  references  where  a  derivative  or  other 
instrument has more than one underlying reference. Behind some of these relationships, for example commodity correlation 
and interest rate-foreign exchange correlations, typically lie macroeconomic factors such as the impact of global demand on 
groups of commodities, or the pricing parity effect of interest rates on foreign exchange rates. More specific relationships can 
exist between credit references or equity stocks in the case of credit derivatives and equity basket derivatives, for example. 
Credit correlations are used to estimate the relationship between the credit performance of a range of credit names, and stock 
correlations are used to estimate the relationship between the returns of a range of equities. A derivative with a correlation 
exposure will be either long- or short-correlation. A high correlation suggests a strong relationship between the underlying 
references is in force, and this will lead to an increase in value of a long-correlation derivative. Negative correlations suggest 
that the relationship between underlying references is opposing, i.e., an increase in price of one underlying reference will lead 
to a reduction in the price of the other.  

An EBITDA (‘earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization’) multiple approach can be used in the valuation of 
less liquid securities. Under this approach the enterprise value (‘EV’) of an entity can be estimated via identifying the ratio of 
the EV to EBITDA of a comparable observable entity and applying this ratio to the EBITDA of the entity for which a valuation 
is being estimated. Under this approach a liquidity adjustment is often applied due to the difference in liquidity between the 
generally listed comparable used and the company under valuation. A higher EV/EBITDA multiple will result in a higher fair 
value.

Unrealized gains or losses on Level 3 instruments held or in issue at the reporting 
date 

The unrealized gains or losses on Level 3 Instruments are not solely due to unobservable parameters. Many of the parameter 
inputs  to  the  valuation  of  instruments  in  this  level  of  the  hierarchy  are  observable  and  the  gain  or  loss  is  partly  due  to 
movements  in  these  observable  parameters  over  the  period.  Many  of  the  positions  in  this  level  of  the  hierarchy  are 
economically hedged by instruments which are categorized in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The offsetting gains and 
losses that have been recorded on all such hedges are not included in the table below, which only shows the gains and losses 
related to the Level 3 classified instruments themselves held at the reporting date in accordance with IFRS 13. The unrealized 
gains and losses on Level 3 instruments are included in both net interest income and net gains on financial assets/liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated income statement.

Recognition of trade date profit 

If  there  are  significant  unobservable  inputs  used  in  a  valuation  technique  on  initial  recognition,  the  financial  instrument  is 
recognized at the transaction price and any trade date profit is deferred. The table below presents the movement during the 
year of the trade date profits deferred due to significant unobservable parameters for financial instruments classified at fair 
value through profit or loss. The balance is predominantly related to derivative instruments.

14 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments not carried at Fair Value 

14 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments not carried at Fair 
Value 

Financial instruments not carried at fair value are not managed on a fair value basis. For these instruments fair values are 
calculated for disclosure purposes only and do not impact the Group balance sheet or income statement. Additionally, since 
the instruments generally do not trade, there is significant management judgment required to determine these fair values. 
Differences in carrying value versus fair value as of December 31, 2023, are consistent with current interest rate environment 
as compared to December 31, 2022. 

For  the  following  financial  instruments  which  are  predominantly  short-term,  the  carrying  value  represents  a  reasonable 
estimate of the fair value: 

Assets 
Cash and central bank balances 
Interbank balances (w/o central banks) 

Central bank funds sold, and securities purchased under resale 
agreements 
Securities borrowed 
Other financial assets 

Liabilities 
Deposits 
Central bank funds purchased, and securities sold under repurchase 
agreements 
Securities loaned 

Other short-term borrowings 
Other financial liabilities 

For all other financial instruments carried at amortized cost, the following valuation techniques are applied:  

–  Retail lending portfolios with a large number of homogenous loans (e.g., residential mortgages) calculate the fair value for 
each product type by discounting the portfolio’s contractual cash flows using the  Group’s new loan rates for lending to 
borrowers  of  similar  credit  quality,  which  includes  the  impact  of  the  macroeconomic  environment.  Key  inputs  for  retail 
mortgages  are  the  difference  between  historic  and  current  product  margins  and  the  estimated  prepayment  rates. 
Capitalized broker fees included in the carrying value are also considered to be at fair value 

–  The fair value of the corporate lending portfolio is estimated predominantly by discounting the loan until it’s maturity, based 

on the loan specific credit spreads and funding costs for the Group.  

–  For  long-term  debt  and  trust  preferred  securities,  fair  value  is  determined  from  quoted  market  prices,  where  available. 
Where  quoted  market  prices  are  not  available,  fair  value  is  estimated  using  a  valuation  technique  that  discounts  the 
remaining contractual cash flows at a rate at which an instrument with similar characteristics is quoted in the market. 
–  A discounted cash flow model is generally used for determining the fair value of deposits since market data is usually not 
available.  In  addition  to  the  yield  curve,  Deutsche  Bank’s  own  credit  spread  is  also  considered.  Credit  spreads  of  the 
respective counterparties are not used in the measurement of fair value on financial liabilities at amortized cost. 

For these financial instruments carried at amortized costs, the disclosed fair value is categorized under the IFRS fair value 
hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) as outlined in Note 13- Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value. In general, 
Level 1 includes Cash and Central bank balances; Level 2 includes Interbank balances (w/o central banks), Central bank 
funds sold, and securities purchased under resale agreements, Securities borrowed, Other financial assets, Deposits, Central 
bank funds purchased, and securities sold under repurchase agreements, Securities loaned, Other short- term borrowings, 
Other financial liabilities, Long- term debt and Trust preferred securities; and Level 3 includes Loans.

1  Amounts generally presented on a gross basis, in line with the Group’s accounting policy regarding offsetting of financial instruments as described in Note 1 “Material 

Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates” 

As of December 31, 2023, the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of loans is primarily driven by the 
current interest rates on long-dated retail mortgages in Germany compared to the contractual rate. As part of Postbank IT 
migration project, the Group has aligned its risk management modelling approach of interest rate prepayment risk factors for 
its long-dated retail mortgages in Germany in the third quarter 2023. This resulted in an increase of the fair value of such 
mortgages by € 2.5 billion. Partly offsetting the loan carrying amount were macro hedge accounting adjustments under the 
EU carve-out version of IAS 39, which were € 5.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and € 7.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. 
The deposits’ fair value was greater than the carrying value as the carrying value included negative macro hedge accounting 
adjustments  under  the  EU  carve-out  version  of  IAS 39  of  € 3.4 billion  and  € 7.7 billion  as  of  December 31,  2023,  and 
December 31,  2022,  respectively.  For  long-term  debt  and  trust  preferred  securities,  the  difference  between  fair  value  and 
carrying value is due to the change in interest rates at which the Group could issue debt with similar maturity and subordination 
at the balance sheet date compared to the rate the instrument was issued at. The carrying values included in the table do not 
include any impacts from economic hedges.

The  column  ‘Gross amounts  set  off  on  the  balance  sheet’  discloses  the  amounts offset  in  accordance  with  all  the  criteria 
described in Note 1 “Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates: Offsetting Financial Instruments”. 

The column ‘Impact of Master Netting Agreements’ discloses the amounts that are subject to master netting agreements but 
were not offset because they did not meet the net settlement/simultaneous settlement criteria; or because the rights of set off 
are conditional upon the default of the counterparty only. The amounts presented for other assets and other liabilities include 
cash margin receivables and payables respectively. 

The  columns  ‘Cash  collateral’  and  ‘Financial  instrument  collateral’  disclose  the  cash  and  financial  instrument  collateral 
amounts received or pledged in relation to the total amounts of assets and liabilities, including those that were not offset. 

Non-enforceable master netting agreements or similar agreements refer to contracts executed in jurisdictions where the rights 
of set off may not be upheld under the local bankruptcy laws. 

The cash collateral received against the positive market values of derivatives and the cash collateral pledged towards the 
negative mark-to-market values of derivatives are booked within the ‘Other liabilities’ and ‘Other assets’ balances respectively. 

The Cash and Financial instrument collateral amounts disclosed reflect their fair values. The rights of set off relating to the 
cash and financial instrument collateral are conditional upon the default of the counterparty.

20 – Transfer of Financial Assets, Assets Pledged and Received 
as Collateral 

The Group enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets held on the balance sheet and as a result may either 
be eligible to derecognize the transferred asset in its entirety or must continue to recognize the transferred asset to the extent 
of  any  continuing  involvement,  depending  on  certain  criteria.  These  criteria  are  discussed  in  Note 1  “Material  Accounting 
Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates”. 

Where financial assets are not eligible to be derecognized, the transfers are viewed as secured financing transactions, with 
any consideration received resulting in a corresponding liability. The Group is not entitled to use these financial assets for any 
other purposes. The most common transactions of this nature entered into by the Group are repurchase agreements, securities 
lending agreements and total return swaps, in which the Group retains substantially all of the associated credit, equity price, 
interest rate and foreign exchange risks and rewards associated with the assets as well as the associated income streams.

Notes to the consolidated balance sheet 
20 – Transfer of Financial Assets, Assets Pledged and Received as Collateral 

The  Group  could  retain  some  exposure  to  the  future  performance  of  a  transferred  asset  either  through  new  or  existing 
contractual rights and obligations and still be eligible to derecognize the asset. This ongoing involvement will be recognized 
as a new instrument which may be different from the original financial asset that was transferred. Typical transactions include 
retaining  senior  notes  of  non-consolidated  securitizations  to  which  originated  loans  have  been  transferred;  financing 
arrangements with structured entities to which the Group has sold a portfolio of assets; or sales of assets with credit-contingent 
swaps. The Group’s exposure to such transactions is not considered to be significant as any substantial retention of risks 
associated with the transferred asset will commonly result in an initial failure to derecognize. Transactions not considered to 
result in an ongoing involvement include normal warranties on fraudulent activities that could invalidate a transfer in the event 
of  legal  action,  qualifying  pass-through  arrangements  and  standard  trustee  or  administrative  fees  that  are  not  linked  to 
performance.

21 – Property and Equipment 

Depreciation expenses, impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses on property and equipment are recorded within 
general and administrative expenses for the income statement. 

The carrying value of items of property and equipment on which there is a restriction on sale was € 24 million and € 25 million 
as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.  

Commitments for the acquisition of property and equipment were € 96 million at year-end 2023 and € 150 million at year-end 
2022.  

The Group leases many assets including land and buildings, vehicles and IT equipment for which it records right-of-use assets. 
During  2023,  additions  to  right-of-use  assets  amounted  to  € 263 million  and  largely  reflected  new  real  estate  leases. 
Depreciation charges of € 543 million recognized in 2023 mainly resulted from planned consumption of right-of-use assets for 
property  leases  over  their  contractual  terms.  The  carrying  amount  of  right-of-use  assets  of  € 4.0 billion  included  in  Total 
Property and equipment as of December 31, 2023 predominantly represented leased properties of € 4.0 billion and vehicle 
leases of € 13 million. For more information on the Group´s leased properties and related disclosures required under IFRS 16, 
please refer to Note 22 “Leases”.

22 – Leases  

The Group’s disclosures are as a lessee under lease arrangements covering property and equipment. The Group has applied 
judgement  in  presenting  related  information  pursuant  to  IFRS 16  in  a  manner  that  it  considers  to  be  most  relevant  to  an 
understanding of its financial performance and position. 

The Group leases many assets including land and buildings, vehicles and IT equipment. The Group is a lessee for the majority 
of its offices and branches under long-term rental agreements. Most of the lease contracts are made under usual terms and 
conditions, which means they include options to extend the lease by a defined amount of time, price adjustment clauses and 
escalation clauses in line with general office rental market conditions. However, the lease agreements do not include any 
clauses that impose any restriction on the Group’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt financing transactions or enter into 
further lease agreements.  

As of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022), the Group recorded right-of-use assets on its balance sheet with a carrying 
amount of € 4.0 billion (€ 4.0 billion), which are included in Property and equipment. The right-of-use assets predominantly 
represented  leased  properties  of  € 4.0 billion  (€ 4.0 billion)  and  vehicle  leases  of  € 13 million  (€ 10 million).  For  more 
information on the year-to-date development of right-of-use assets, please refer to Note 21 “Property and Equipment”. 

Corresponding  to  the  recognition  of  the  right-of-use  assets,  as  of  December 31,  2023  (December 31,  2022),  the  Group 
recorded lease liabilities on its balance sheet with a carrying amount of € 4.5 billion (€ 4.5 billion), which are included in Other 
liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, the lease liabilities included the discounted value of future lease payments of € 477 million 
for the Group headquarters in Frankfurt am Main that was sold and leased back on December 1, 2011. The lease has a fixed 
term through to the end of 2036, with options to extend the lease for two additional five-year periods to the end of 2046. 

During 2023 and 2022, interest expenses recorded from the compounding of the lease liabilities amounted to € 113 million 
and € 85 million, respectively. The contractual maturities for the undiscounted cash flows from these liabilities are shown in 
Note 31 “Maturity Analysis of the earliest contractual undiscounted cash flows of Financial Liabilities”. 

Expenses recognized in 2023 (2022) relating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, for which the Group decided 
to apply the recognition exemption under IFRS 16 (and thus not to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities 
on the balance sheet), amounted to € 1 million (€ 1 million) and € 0 million (€ 0 million), respectively.  

Income recorded in 2023 (2022) from the subletting of right-of-use assets totaled € 29 million (€ 29 million).  

The total cash outflow for leases for 2023 (2022) was € 645 million (€ 691 million) and represented mainly expenditures made 
for  real  estate  rentals  over  € 638 million  (€ 683 million).  Of  the  total  cash  outflow  amount,  payments  of  € 534 million 
(€ 607 million) were made for the principal portion of lease liabilities, payments of € 111 million (€ 84 million) were made for 
the interest portion.  

Total future cash outflows to which the Group as a lessee is potentially exposed, that are not reflected in the measurement of 
the lease liabilities, mainly include potential payment exposures arising from extension options (2023: € 4.9 billion) and future 
payments for leases not yet commenced, but to which the Group is committed (2023: € 40 million). Their expected maturities 
are shown in the table below.

Following the acquisition of Numis Corporation Plc on October 13, 2023 (see Note 3), the purchase price allocation for the 
business  combination  resulted in  the  recognition  of  goodwill  for  € 235 million  which  was  allocated  to  the  Investment Bank 
CGU. Given the valuation of the Investment Bank CGU with a continued shortfall of its recoverable amount versus its carrying 
amount, the goodwill was considered impaired and fully written off in the fourth quarter 2023.  

Changes in goodwill in 2022 only included foreign exchange rate movements of Asset Management goodwill held in non-
Group currencies. 

Changes in goodwill in 2021 related to the reclassification of € 56 million of Asset Management goodwill to assets held for 
sale, following the designated sale of DWS’ digital investment platform to a joint venture with BlackFin and foreign exchange 
rate movements. Following the acquisition of a payment service provider (Better Payment Germany GmbH) in September 
2021 (see Note 3), as part of the purchase price allocation the Group had recorded goodwill of  € 5 million assigned to the 
Corporate  Bank  CGU.  Given  the  valuation  of  the  CGU  continued  to  have  a  shortfall  of  its  recoverable  amount  versus  its 
carrying amount, the newly acquired goodwill was considered impaired and fully written off in 2021.

Goodwill Impairment Test 

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the appropriate CGU on 
the basis as described in Note 1 “Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates”. The Group’s primary CGUs 
are as outlined above. Asset Management’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter by comparing the 
recoverable amount of the CGU with its carrying amount. In addition, the Group tests goodwill whenever a triggering event is 
identified. The recoverable amount is the higher of a CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The Asset 
Management  CGU  was  the  only  goodwill  carrying  CGU  to  be  tested  for  annual  impairment in  2021,  2022  and  2023.  The 
impairment tests conducted on Asset Management in these periods did not result in an impairment loss as the recoverable 
amounts of the Asset Management CGU were higher than the respective carrying amounts.  

A  review  of  the  Group’s  strategy  or  certain  political  or  global  risks  for  the  banking  industry,  uncertainties  regarding  the 
implementation of already adopted regulation and the introduction of legislation that is already under discussion could result 
in an impairment of goodwill in the future. 

Carrying Amount 

The carrying amount of a primary CGU is derived using a capital allocation model based on the Shareholders’ Equity Allocation 
Framework  of  the  Group  (please  refer  to  Note 4,  “Business  Segments  and  Related  Information”  for  more  details).  The 
allocation uses the Group’s total equity at the date of valuation, including Additional Tier 1 Notes (AT1 Notes), which constitute 
unsecured and subordinated notes of Deutsche Bank and which are classified as additional equity components in accordance 
with IFRS. Total equity is adjusted for an add-on adjustment for goodwill attributable to noncontrolling interests.  

Recoverable Amount  

The Group determines the recoverable amounts of its primary CGUs on the basis of the higher of value in use and fair value 
less costs of disposal (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). It employs a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, which reflects the 
specifics of the banking business and its regulatory environment. The model calculates the present value of the estimated 
future  earnings  that  are  distributable  to  shareholders  after  fulfilling  the  respective  regulatory  capital  requirements.  The 
recoverable amounts also include the fair value of the AT1 Notes, which are allocated to the primary CGUs.  

The DCF model uses earnings projections and respective capitalization assumptions based on five-year financial plans as 
well  as  longer  term  expectations  on  the  impact  of  regulatory  developments,  which  are  discounted  to  their  present  value. 
Estimating future earnings and capital requirements involves judgment and the consideration of past and current performances 
as well as expected developments in the respective markets, and in the overall macroeconomic and regulatory environments. 
Earnings projections beyond the initial five-year period are, where applicable, adjusted to derive a sustainable level. In case 
of a going concern, the cash flow to equity is assumed to increase by or converge towards a constant long-term growth rate 
for the Asset Management CGU of up to 3.0% (2022: up to 3.0%). This is based on projected revenue forecasts of the CGU 
as well as expectations for the development of gross domestic product and inflation and is captured in the terminal value.

23 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Key Assumptions and Sensitivities  

Key Assumptions: The DCF value of a CGU is sensitive to the earnings projections, to the discount rate (cost of equity) applied 
and, to a lesser extent, to the long-term growth rate. The discount rates applied have been determined based on the capital 
asset pricing model and comprise a risk-free interest rate, a market risk premium and a factor covering the systematic market 
risk (beta factor). The values for the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and the beta factors are determined using 
external sources of information. CGU-specific beta factors are determined based on a respective group of peer companies. 
Variations in all of these components might impact the discount rates. For the Asset Management CGU, the discount rates 
(after tax) applied for 2023 and 2022 were 10.9% and 10.3%, respectively. 

Management determined the values for the key assumptions in the following table based on a combination of internal and 
external analysis. Estimates for efficiency and the cost reduction program are based on progress made to date and scheduled 
future projects and initiatives. 

Key management assumptions are:

—  Business/execution risks, e.g., underachievement of 
net flow targets from market uncertainty, loss of high-
quality client facing employees, unfavorable investment 
performance, lower than expected efficiency gains 

—  Uncertainty around regulation and its potential 

implications not yet anticipated 

Sensitivities: In order to test the resilience of the recoverable amount, key assumptions used in the DCF model (for example, 
the  discount  rate  and  the  earnings  projections)  are  sensitized.  Currently,  in  Asset  Management  the  recoverable  amount 
exceeds the carrying amount by 14% / € 1.0 billion.

23 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Amortizing Intangible Assets  

In 2023, amortizing intangible assets increased by € 330 million. This includes amortization expenses of € 1.1 billion, mostly 
for the scheduled consumption of capitalized software (€ 1.1 billion) and the impairment of current platform software as well 
as software under construction (€ 24 million). Additions to internally generated intangible assets of € 1.3 billion resulting from 
the capitalization of expenses incurred in conjunction with the Group’s development of own-used software overcompensated 
the negative impact from amortization and impairment charges on net book value.  A stronger euro exchange rate against 
major currencies accounted for net negative exchange rate changes of € (19) million. 

In 2022, amortizing intangible assets increased by € 173 million. This includes amortization expenses of € 1.0 billion, mostly 
for the scheduled consumption of capitalized software (€ 1.0 billion) and the impairment of current platform software as well 
as software under construction (€ 30 million). Additions to internally generated intangible assets of € 1.1 billion resulting from 
the capitalization of expenses incurred in conjunction with the Group’s development of own-used software overcompensated 
the negative impact from amortization and impairment charges on net book value. A weaker euro exchange rate against major 
currencies accounted for net positive exchange rate changes of € 50 million. 

In 2021, amortizing other intangible assets remained nearly unchanged, decreasing only slightly by € 22 million. This reflects 
amortization expenses of  € 1.0 billion,  mostly  for the  scheduled  consumption of  capitalized  software (€ 1.0 billion) and  the 
impairment of current platform software as well as software under construction (€ 149 million). Additions to internally generated 
intangible  assets  of  € 1.1 billion  resulting  from  the  capitalization  of  expenses  incurred  in  conjunction  with  the  Group’s 
development of own-used software compensated for the decrease in net book value. A weaker euro exchange rate against 
major currencies accounted for positive exchange rate changes of € 42 million. 

Other intangible assets with finite useful lives are generally amortized over their useful lives based on the straight-line method.

Within  this  asset  class,  the  Group  recognizes  certain  contract-based  and  marketing-related  intangible  assets,  which  are 
deemed to have an indefinite useful life.  

In particular, the asset class comprises the below detailed investment management agreements related to retail mutual funds 
and certain trademarks. Due to the specific nature of these intangible assets, market prices are ordinarily not observable and, 
therefore, the Group values such assets based on the income approach, using a post-tax DCF-methodology.  

Retail investment management agreements: These assets, amounting to € 716 million, relate to the Group’s U.S. retail mutual 
fund business and are allocated to the Asset Management CGU. Retail investment management agreements are contracts 
that  give  Asset  Management  the  exclusive  right  to  manage  a  variety  of  mutual  funds  for  a  specified  period.  Since  these 
contracts are easily renewable at minimal cost, these agreements are not expected to have a foreseeable limit on the contract 
period. Therefore, the rights to manage the associated assets under management are expected to generate cash flows for an 
indefinite period of time. This intangible asset was recorded at fair value based upon a valuation provided by a third party at 
the date of acquisition of Zurich Scudder Investments, Inc. in 2002.  

The recoverable amount was calculated as fair value less costs of disposal using the multi-period excess earnings method 
applying a five-year plan and the fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The key 
assumptions in determining the fair value less costs of disposal include the asset mix, the flows forecast, the effective fee rate 
and discount rate as well as the terminal value growth rate. The discount rate (cost of equity) applied in the annual impairment 
test was 10.9% in 2023 (10.6% in 2022). The terminal value growth rate applied for 2023 was 3.4% (for 2022 3.8%).  

As of December 31, 2023, the impairment analysis did not result in an impairment. As of December 31, 2022, an impairment 
loss of € 68 million was recognized in the Group’s income statement within impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, 
due to net outflows and change in discount rate to 10.9% in the fourth quarter 2022.

DWS completes closing of transfer of its digital investment platform as part of its partnership 
with BlackFin 

In September 2021, DWS Group (“DWS”) and BlackFin Capital Partners (“BlackFin”) had agreed on a long-term strategic 
partnership to jointly evolve the digital investment platform into a platform eco system that provides comprehensive solutions 
and  services.  It  was  agreed  that  DWS  would  transfer  its  digital  investment  platform  into  a  joint  venture  with  BlackFin, 
maintaining a stake of 30%. The transaction to transfer the digital investment platform into the newly established company 
MorgenFund GmbH closed as of November 30, 2022. As part of the consideration, the Group received a 30% stake in that 
company which is accounted for under the equity method and held in the Asset Management division. 

Sale of the Italian financial advisors business to Zurich Italy 

In August 2021, Deutsche Bank and Zurich Insurance Group Italy (“Zurich Italy”) reached an agreement with Zurich Italy Bank

2022. Under the terms of the agreement, a total of 1,085 Financial Advisors, 96 employees, and approximately € 16 billion in 
assets under management (of which € 1 billion Discretionary Portfolio Management still managed by Deutsche Bank) have 
passed to Zurich Bank Italy S.p.A. The pre-tax gain on sale totaled € 312 million and was recorded in the Private Bank segment 
results in the fourth quarter of 2022.

related off-balance sheet positions are disclosed 

Classes of Provisions 

Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, 
or  from  external  events.  The  definition  used  for  the  purposes  of  determining  operational  provisions  differs  from  the  risk 
management definition, as it excludes risk of loss resulting from civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters. For risk 
management purposes, operational risk includes legal risk, as payments to customers, counterparties and regulatory bodies 
in civil litigations or regulatory enforcement matters constitute loss events for operational shortcomings, but excludes business 
and reputational risk. 

Civil Litigation provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging non-compliance with contractual or 
other legal or regulatory responsibilities, which have resulted or may result in demands from customers, counterparties or 
other parties in civil litigations. 

Regulatory Enforcement provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging non-compliance with legal 
or  regulatory  responsibilities,  which  have  resulted  or  may  result  in  an  assessment  of  fines  or  penalties  by  governmental 
regulatory agencies, self-regulatory organizations or other enforcement authorities.  

Restructuring provisions arise out of restructuring activities. The Group aims to enhance its long-term competitiveness through 
major reductions in costs, duplication and complexity in the years ahead. For details see Note 10 “Restructuring”. 

Other provisions include several specific items arising from a variety of different circumstances, including the provision for the 
reimbursement of loan processing fees, deferred sales commissions, provisions for bank levies and mortgage repurchase 
demands. 

Provisions and Contingent Liabilities 

The Group recognizes a provision for potential loss only when there is a present obligation arising from a past event that is 
probable to result in an economic outflow that can be reliably estimated. Where a reliable estimate cannot be made for such 
an obligation, no provision is recognized and the obligation is deemed a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities also include 
possible obligations for which the possibility of future economic outflow is more than remote but less than probable. Where a 
provision has been taken for a particular claim, no contingent liability is recorded; for matters or sets of matters consisting of 
more than one claim, however, provisions may be recorded for some claims, and contingent liabilities (or neither a provision 
nor a contingent liability) may be recorded for others. 

The Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to significant litigation risks. As a result, the Group 
is involved in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings and investigations in Germany and in a number of jurisdictions 
outside Germany, including the United States. In recent years, regulation and supervision in a number of areas have increased, 
and regulators, governmental bodies and others have sought to subject financial services providers to increasing oversight 
and scrutiny, which in turn has led to additional regulatory investigations and enforcement actions which are often followed by 
civil litigation.

Notes to the consolidated balance sheet 
27 – Provisions 

In determining for which of the claims the possibility of a loss is probable, or less than probable but more than remote, and 
then estimating the possible loss for those claims, the Group takes into consideration a number of factors, including but not 
limited to the nature of the claim and its underlying facts, the procedural posture and litigation history of each case, rulings by 
the courts or tribunals, the Group’s experience and the experience of others in similar cases (to the extent this is known to the 
Group), prior settlement discussions, settlements by others in similar cases (to the extent this is known to the Group), available 
indemnities and the opinions and views of legal counsel and other experts.  

The provisions the Group has recognized for civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters as of December 31, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022 are set forth in the table above. For some matters when the Group believes an outflow of funds is probable, 
but the Group could not reliably estimate the amount of the potential outflow, no provision was recognized. 

For the matters for which a reliable estimate can be made, but the probability of a future loss or outflow of resources is more 
than remote but less than probable, the Group currently estimates that, as of December 31, 2023, these contingent liabilities 
are  approximately  € 1.9 billion  for  civil  litigation  matters  (December 31,  2022:  € 1.8 billion)  and  € 0.2 billion  for  regulatory 
enforcement matters (December 31, 2022: € 0.1 billion). These figures include matters where the Group’s potential liability is 
joint and several and where the Group expects any such liability to be paid by a third party. If the Group’s best estimate is 
within a range, the amount at the top of the range is disclosed for contingent liabilities.  

For other significant civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters where the Group believes the possibility of an outflow 
of funds is more than remote but less than probable, but the amount is not reliably estimable, such matters are not included 
in the contingent liability estimates. In addition, where the Group believes the possibility of an outflow of funds is remote, the 
Group has neither recognized a provision nor included the matters in the contingent liability estimates.  

This estimated possible loss, as well as any provisions taken, is based upon currently available information and is subject to 
significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, variables and known and unknown uncertainties. These uncertainties may 
include inaccuracies in or incompleteness of the information available to the Group, particularly at the preliminary stages of 
matters, and assumptions by the Group as to future rulings of courts or other tribunals or the likely actions or positions taken 
by  regulators  or  adversaries  may  prove  incorrect.  Moreover,  estimates  of  possible  loss  for  these  matters  are  often  not 
amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools frequently used in making judgments and estimates, 
and are subject to even greater degrees of uncertainty than in many other areas where the Group must exercise judgment 
and make estimates. The estimated possible loss, as well as any provisions taken, can be and often are substantially less 
than the amount initially requested by regulators or adversaries or the maximum potential loss that could be incurred were the 
matters to result in a final adjudication adverse to the Group. Moreover, in several regions in which the Group operates, an 
adversary often is not required to set forth the amount it is seeking, and where it is, the amount may not be subject to the 
same requirements that generally apply to pleading factual allegations or legal claims. 

The matters for which the Group determines that the possibility of a future loss is more than remote will change from time to 
time, as will the matters as to which a reliable estimate can be made and the estimated possible loss for such matters. Actual 
results may prove to be significantly higher or lower than the estimate of possible loss in those matters where such an estimate 
was made. In addition, loss may be incurred in matters with respect to which the Group believed the likelihood of loss was 
remote. In particular, the estimated aggregate possible loss does not represent the Group’s potential maximum loss exposure 
for those matters.  

The Group may settle litigation or regulatory proceedings or investigations prior to a final judgment or determination of liability. 
It may do so to avoid the cost, management efforts or negative business, regulatory or reputational consequences of continuing 
to  contest  liability,  even  when  the  Group  believes  it  has  valid  defenses  to  liability.  It  may  also  do  so  when  the  potential 
consequences of failing to prevail would be disproportionate to the costs of settlement. Furthermore, the Group may, for similar 
reasons, reimburse counterparties for their losses even in situations where it does not believe that it is legally compelled to do 
so. 

Current Individual Proceedings  

Set forth below are descriptions of civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters or groups of matters for which the Group 
has taken material provisions, or for which there are material contingent liabilities that are more than remote, or for which there 
is the possibility of material business or reputational risk, as well as other significant matters; similar matters are grouped 
together and some matters consist of a number of proceedings or claims. The disclosed matters also include matters for which 
the possibility of a loss is more than remote but for which the Group cannot reliably estimate the possible loss. Matters are 
presented below in English-language alphabetical order based on the titles the Group has used for them.

27 – Provisions 

Biscayne. On July 6, 2021, the bank and several Group entities were named as defendants in a civil litigation filed in the U.S. 
District  Court  for  the  Southern District  of  Florida,  alleging  that the  defendants  facilitated  or  negligently  failed  to  uncover  a 
scheme  orchestrated  by  certain  bank  customers  referred  to  as  the  “Biscayne”  entities.  The  action  was  brought  by  the 
liquidators appointed for these entities. The matter proceeded to trial in April 2023 and resulted in an adverse jury trial verdict 
of U.S. $ 95 million. The bank appealed the verdict to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 22, 2024, the parties 
executed a settlement agreement pursuant to which the bank will pay the liquidators U.S. $ 43.5 million, and all claims against 
the bank and the Group entities will be dismissed. The settlement was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern 
District of Florida on February 28, 2024. 

Consent Order and Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve. On July 19, 2023, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank AG New 
York  Branch,  DB  USA  Corporation,  Deutsche  Bank  Trust  Company  Americas  and  DWS  USA  Corporation  entered  into  a 
Consent  Order  and  Written  Agreement  with  the  Federal  Reserve  resolving  previously  disclosed  regulatory  discussions 
concerning adherence to prior orders and settlements related to sanctions and embargoes and AML compliance, and remedial 
agreements  and  obligations  related  to  risk  management  issues.  The  Consent  Order  alleges  insufficient  and  tardy 
implementation  of  the  post-settlement  sanctions  and  embargoes  and  AML  control  enhancement  undertakings  required by 
prior  Consent  Orders  the  bank  entered  into  with  the  Federal  Reserve  in  2015  and  2017.  The  Written  Agreement  alleges 
various deficiencies in governance, risk management, and internal controls across the bank’s U.S. operations, and finds that 
the bank must  continue to implement additional improvements. The Consent Order requires Deutsche Bank to pay a civil 
monetary penalty of U.S. $ 186 million, including U.S. $ 140 million for the violations alleged with respect to the post-settlement 
sanctions and embargoes and AML control enhancement undertakings, as well as a separate penalty of U.S. $ 46 million for 
unsafe or unsound practices stemming from the bank’s handling of its legacy correspondent banking relationship with Danske 
Bank Estonia, which was terminated in October 2015. The Written Agreement does not include a civil monetary penalty. Both 
the Consent Order and Written Agreement include certain post-settlement remediation and reporting undertakings. 

Cum-ex  Investigations  and  Litigations.  Deutsche  Bank  has  received  inquiries  from  law  enforcement  authorities,  including 
requests for information and documents, in relation to cum-ex transactions of clients. “Cum-ex” refers to trading activities in 
German  shares  around  dividend  record  dates  (trade  date  before  and  settlement  date  after  dividend  record  date)  for  the 
purpose  of  obtaining  German  tax  credits  or  refunds  in  relation  to  withholding  tax  levied  on  dividend  payments,  including 
transaction structures that have resulted in more than one market participant claiming such credit or refund with respect to the 
same  dividend  payment.  Cum-ex  transactions  are  regarded  as  criminal  tax  evasion  by  German  courts.  Deutsche  Bank  is 
cooperating with the law enforcement authorities in these matters. 

The  Public  Prosecutor  in  Cologne  (Staatsanwaltschaft  Köln,  “CPP”)  has  been  conducting  a  criminal  investigation  since 
August 2017 concerning two former employees of Deutsche Bank in relation to cum-ex transactions of certain former clients 
of the bank. In October 2022, the CPP conducted a search at Deutsche Bank’s offices in Frankfurt and Eschborn. Based on 
the search warrant the CPP expanded the scope of the investigation. Current and former Deutsche Bank employees and 
seven former Management Board members are included in the investigation. The investigation is still at an early stage and 
the  scope  of  the  investigation  may  be  further  broadened.  Deutsche  Bank  is  a  potential  secondary  participant  pursuant  to 
Section 30 of the German Law on Administrative Offences in this proceeding. This proceeding could result in a disgorgement 
of profits and fines. Deutsche Bank is cooperating with the CPP. 

In May 2021, Deutsche Bank learned through an information request received by Deutsche Oppenheim Family Office AG 
(DOAG) as legal successor of Sal. Oppenheim jr. & Cie. AG & Co. KGaA (Sal. Oppenheim) that the CPP in 2021 opened a 
criminal investigation proceeding in relation to cum-ex transactions against unknown former personnel of Sal. Oppenheim. 
DOAG provided the requested information. 

On July 12, 2023, Deutsche Bank as legal successor of Deutsche Postbank AG was informed by the CPP that the CPP has 
opened a new separate criminal cum-ex investigation against unnamed personnel of former Deutsche Postbank AG. 

Deutsche  Bank  acted  as  participant  in  and  filed  withholding  tax  refund  claims  through  the  electronic  refund  procedure 
(elektronisches  Datenträgerverfahren)  on  behalf  of,  inter  alia,  two  former  custody  clients  in  connection  with  their  cum-ex 
transactions. In February 2018, Deutsche Bank received from the German Federal Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern, 
“FTO”) a  demand  of  approximately  € 49 million  for tax  refunds  paid  to  a  former custody  client.  Deutsche Bank  expects  to 
receive  a  formal  notice  for  the  same  amount.  In  December 2019,  Deutsche  Bank  received  a  liability  notice  from  the  FTO 
requesting payment of € 2.1 million in connection with tax refund claims Deutsche Bank had submitted on behalf of another 
former custody client, which Deutsche Bank paid in early 2020. In July 2022, Deutsche Bank filed a claim against the payment 
with the Fiscal Court of Cologne (Finanzgericht Köln).

27 – Provisions 

In  2018, The  Bank  of  New  York  Mellon  SA/NV  (BNY)  informed  Deutsche Bank  of  its  intention  to  seek  indemnification  for 
potential cum-ex related tax liabilities incurred by BHF Asset Servicing GmbH (BAS) and/or Frankfurter Service Kapitalanlage-
GmbH (“Service KAG”, now named BNY Mellon Service Kapitalanlage-Gesellschaft mbH). Deutsche Bank had acquired BAS 
and Service KAG as part of the acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim in 2010 and sold them to BNY later that year. BNY estimated 
the  potential  tax  liability  to  be  up  to  € 120 million  (excluding  interest  of  6%  p.a.).  In  late  2020,  counsel  to  BNY  informed 
Deutsche Bank that BNY and/or Service KAG (among others) have received notices from  tax authorities in the estimated 
amount with respect to cum-ex related trades by certain investment funds in 2009 and 2010. BNY has filed objections against 
the  notices.  Following  receipt  of  payment  orders  from  tax  authorities  in  the  amount  of  € 118.3 million  in  relation  to  the 
investment funds and after consultation with Deutsche Bank, BNY paid € 53.6 million to tax authorities. A further € 50.9 million 
were paid by third parties. In addition, BNY received from the Frankfurt Tax Office regarding one of the investment funds a 
notice  and  payment  request  regarding  penalty  interest  (Hinterziehungszinsen)  in  the  amount  of  € 11.6 million.  BNY,  after 
consultation  with  Deutsche  Bank,  applied  for  a  suspension  of  enforcement  (Aussetzung  der  Vollziehung)  regarding  the 
payment request which is now pending at the Fiscal Court of Hesse (Hessisches Finanzgericht). 

In  December  2023,  Deutsche  Bank  received  hearing  letters  from  the  German  Federal  Tax  Office  (Bundeszentralamt  für 
Steuern) regarding two third party investment funds that engaged in cum-ex trades in 2009. Deutsche Bank had provided 
services and financing to investors in the funds. Both funds received an aggregate of € 87 million in cum-ex withholding tax 
refunds in 2009. In February 2024, Deutsche Bank responded to the hearing letters. 

The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because 
it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome. 

FX Derivatives Products Investigations and Litigation. Following an internal investigation into the historical sales of certain FX 
derivatives products, Deutsche Bank is providing information to and otherwise cooperating with its regulators. In December 
2023, the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) announced it will initiate proceedings against Deutsche 
Bank, S.A.E. for advisory services provided to Spanish clients in relation to FX derivative products. Separately, in September 
2021, Deutsche Bank was served with a claim that was filed in the High Court of England and Wales by four companies within 
the Palladium Hotels Group (PHG). PHG is claiming restitution or damages for alleged losses estimated at € 500 million in 
respect of FX derivatives trades entered into with Deutsche Bank between 2013 and 2019. They allege that the trades were 
mis-sold by Deutsche Bank and that one of the four PHG claimants lacked legal capacity to enter into some of the trades. 
Deutsche Bank has filed a defense disputing the claim. In January 2024, PHG filed amended pleadings to include additional 
allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation. Deutsche Bank filed an amended defense in February 2024 which disputes the 
new allegations. Trial is scheduled to commence in early 2025. 

The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because 
it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome. 

FX  Investigations  and  Litigations.  Deutsche  Bank  has  received  requests  for  information  from  certain  regulatory  and  law 
enforcement agencies globally who investigated trading in, and various other aspects of, the foreign exchange market.  

In 2018, a group of asset managers opted out of a consolidated class settlement and filed litigation on an individual basis, 
alleging a conspiracy between traders at 16 banks to manipulate FX benchmark rates and to widen FX currency pair spreads 
in the period 2003 to 2013 (Allianz, et al. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al.). Defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted 
and denied in part in 2020, and the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint.  Deutsche Bank has also been named as a 
defendant in an amended and consolidated class action filed in Israel. This action asserts factual allegations similar to those 
made in the consolidated action in the United States and seeks damages pursuant to Israeli antitrust law as well as other 
causes of action. This action is in preliminary stages. 

In 2020, Deutsche Bank was named in an action issued in the UK High Court of Justice (Commercial Court) brought by many 
of the same plaintiffs who brought Allianz, et al. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. referred to above. The claim is based 
upon factual allegations similar to those made in Allianz, et al. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. In March 2022, the High 
Court ordered that the proceedings be transferred to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal. Deutsche Bank has reached an 
agreement  to  resolve  the  Allianz  proceedings  in  the  U.S.  and  UK  In  May  2023,  both  the  U.S.  and  UK  proceedings  were 
dismissed in their entirety. 

In May 2021, Deutsche Bank S.A. – Banco Alemao was named in a civil antitrust action brought in the São Paulo Civil Court 
of  Central  Jurisdiction  by  the  Association  of  Brazilian  Exporters  (AEB)  against  certain  FX  dealers  and  affiliated  financial 
institutions  in  Brazil.  This  action  asserts  factual  allegations  based  on  conduct  investigated  by  the  Brazilian  competition 
authority, CADE, and seeks damages pursuant to Brazilian antitrust law. In February 2022, the presiding judge dismissed the 
action on the basis that the action was not appropriate for a class proceeding. AEB has appealed the decision. Deutsche Bank 
has not yet been served.

27 – Provisions 

The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because 
it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice their outcome. 

Interbank and Dealer Offered Rates Matters. Regulatory and Law Enforcement Matters. Deutsche Bank has responded to 
requests  for  information  from,  and  cooperated  with,  various  regulatory  and  law  enforcement  agencies,  in  connection  with 
industry-wide investigations concerning the setting of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Euro Interbank Offered 
Rate (EURIBOR), Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) and other interbank and/or dealer offered rates.  

From 2013 through 2017, Deutsche Bank entered into settlements with the European Commission, the U.S. Department of 
Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the New 
York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) and other regulators with respect to interbank and dealer offered rates 
matters. Other investigations of Deutsche Bank concerning the setting of various interbank and/or dealer offered rates remain 
ongoing.  

The  Group  has  not  disclosed  whether  it  has  established  a  provision  or  contingent  liability  with  respect  to  the  remaining 
investigations because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice their outcome.  

Overview of Civil Litigations. Deutsche Bank is party to four U.S. civil actions concerning alleged manipulation relating to the 
setting of various interbank and/or dealer offered rates which are described in the following paragraphs, as well as actions 
pending in the UK, Israel, Argentina and Spain. Most of the civil actions, including putative class actions, are pending in the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), against Deutsche Bank and numerous other defendants. All 
of the U.S. civil actions were filed on behalf of parties who allege losses as a result of manipulation relating to the setting of 
U.S. dollar LIBOR.  

Claims for damages for all four of the U.S. civil actions discussed have been asserted under various legal theories, including 
violations of the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, federal and state antitrust laws, the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act, and other federal and state laws. The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or 
contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice 
seriously their outcome.  

U.S. dollar LIBOR. With one exception, all of the U.S. civil actions concerning U.S. dollar LIBOR are being coordinated as part 
of a multidistrict litigation (the “U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL”) in the SDNY. In light of the large number of individual cases pending 
against Deutsche Bank and their similarity, the civil actions included in the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL are now subsumed under 
the following general description of the litigation pertaining to all such actions, without disclosure of individual actions except 
when the circumstances or the resolution of an individual case is material to Deutsche Bank.  

Following a series of decisions in the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL between March 2013 and March 2019 narrowing their claims, 
plaintiffs  are  currently  asserting  antitrust  claims,  claims  under  the  U.S.  Commodity  Exchange  Act  and  U.S.  Securities 
Exchange Act and state law fraud, contract, unjust enrichment and other tort  claims. The court has also issued decisions 
dismissing certain plaintiffs’ claims for lack of personal jurisdiction and on statute of limitations grounds.  

In 2016, the district court issued a ruling dismissing certain antitrust claims while allowing others to proceed. Multiple plaintiffs 
filed appeals of that ruling. In December 2021, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision on antitrust standing 
grounds but reversed the court’s decision on personal jurisdiction grounds, and it remanded the cases to the district court for 
further proceedings. In March 2022, defendants (including Deutsche Bank) filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. 
Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals’ decision. The U.S. Supreme Court denied defendants’ petition in June 2022. 

In October 2023, plaintiffs in a formerly stayed class action pending as part of the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL (National Asbestos 
Workers Pension Fund, et al. v. Bank of America Corp., et al.) filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, dismissing their case in its 
entirety. 

In August 2020, plaintiffs filed a non-class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several 
financial institutions, alleging that U.S. dollar LIBOR has been suppressed through the present. In September 2022, the court 
granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. Later in 2022, the plaintiffs filed an amended 
complaint, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which the court granted in October 2023. 
Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and an amended notice of appeal 
in November 2023.

27 – Provisions 

There is a further UK civil action regarding U.S. dollar LIBOR brought by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC) acting as receiver for 19 failed financial institutions headquartered in the U.S., in which a claim for damages has been 
asserted pursuant to EU, UK and U.S. state laws. In February 2022, following a ruling issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit in relation to USD LIBOR antitrust claims, the UK LIBOR proceedings were stayed until July 2022, to allow 
for clarification of the position in relation to the parallel proceedings brought by the FDIC against Deutsche Bank in the U.S. 
The FDIC filed an application to reinstate proceedings in the United States in July 2022. Following the expiration of the UK 
stay, at a case management conference that took place in December 2022, the UK Court ordered a trial of a sample of three 
of  the  failed  financial  institutions.  This  ‘sample  bank’  trial  has  been  listed  for  a  19-week  trial  in  February  2026.  In 
December 2022, the SDNY granted the FDIC’s application to reinstate certain of its claims against Deutsche Bank (and the 
other foreign defendants) in the U.S. to the extent these claims survived a motion to dismiss on the merits and subject to 
defendants’ reservation of rights to dispute the claims in the future. 

A further class action regarding LIBOR has been filed in Argentina seeking damages for losses allegedly suffered by holders 
of Argentine bonds with interest rates based on LIBOR. Deutsche Bank is defending this action. 

GBP LIBOR and CHF LIBOR. Putative class actions alleging manipulation of GBP LIBOR and CHF LIBOR were pending but 
have been settled, with final approvals granted in 2023, in the amounts of U.S. $ 5 million and U.S. $ 13 million, respectively. 
Accordingly, the actions are no longer reflected in the litigation provisions. 

Jeffrey Epstein Matters. In December 2018, Deutsche Bank began the process to terminate its client relationship with Jeffrey 
Epstein,  which  began  in  August  2013.  Since  Epstein’s  arrest  in  July  2019,  Deutsche  Bank  provided  information  to  and 
cooperated with various regulatory and law enforcement agencies concerning the bank’s former client relationship with Epstein 
(individually, and through related parties and entities), completed an internal investigation into the Epstein relationship, and 
entered into settlements to resolve certain regulatory and litigation matters, as outlined below. 

In 2020, the DFS issued a Consent Order, finding that Deutsche Bank violated New York State banking laws in connection 
with  its  relationships  with  three  former  Deutsche  Bank  clients,  Danske  Bank’s  Estonia  branch,  Jeffrey  Epstein  and  FBME 
Bank,  and imposing  a  U.S. $ 150 million  civil penalty  in  connection  with  these  three former  relationships,  which  Deutsche 
Bank paid in the third quarter of 2020. The Bank was also named as a defendant in a securities class action in the U.S. District 
Court for the SDNY that included allegations relating to the bank’s relationship with Epstein and other entities. In September 
2022, the parties reached a class action settlement in the amount of U.S. $ 26.3 million, which the Court approved in an order 
dated February 6, 2023. 

In addition, on November 24, 2022, Deutsche Bank was named as a defendant in a class action complaint filed in the U.S. 
District Court for the SDNY by an unnamed alleged sex trafficking victim of Epstein, alleging claims against the bank under 
the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Act,  Racketeer  Influenced  and  Corrupt  Organizations  Act  and  New  York  state  law  in 
connection the bank’s former client relationship with Epstein. In May 2023, the parties reached a class action settlement in 
the amount of U.S. $ 75 million, which the Court approved in an order dated October 20, 2023. 

On December 26, 2023, Deutsche Bank and the Attorney General of New Mexico (“NMAG”) announced a U.S. $ 5 million 
pledge by Deutsche Bank to fund additional resources to prevent, investigate, and prosecute human trafficking in the state of 
New Mexico. Deutsche Bank made that pledge following the NMAG’s ongoing investigation into various financial services 
firms’ banking relationships with Epstein. 

On  November  23,  2023,  Deutsche  Bank  AG,  Deutsche  Bank  AG  New  York  Branch,  and  Deutsche  Bank  Trust  Company 
Americas (DBTCA) were named as defendants in a complaint filed in New York State Supreme Court by an alleged victim of 
Epstein. However, Deutsche Bank has still not been served in this action. The complaint, amended on December 31, 2023, 
contains the same Trafficking Victims Protection Act and New York law claims that were filed in the recently settled class 
action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY mentioned above.

KOSPI Index Unwind Matters. Following the decline of the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (the “KOSPI 200”) in the 
closing  auction on  November  11,  2010  by  approximately  2.7%,  the  Korean  Financial Supervisory Service  commenced  an 
investigation and expressed concerns that the fall in the KOSPI 200 was attributable to a sale by Deutsche Bank of a basket 
of stocks, worth approximately € 1.6 billion, that was held as part of an index arbitrage position on the KOSPI 200. On August 
19,  2011,  the  Korean  Prosecutor’s  Office  indicted  DSK  and  four  employees  of  the  Deutsche  Bank  group  on  charges  of 
spot/futures-linked market manipulation. In January 2016, the Seoul Central District Court rendered guilty verdicts against a 
DSK trader and DSK. A criminal fine of KRW 1.5 billion (less than € 2 million) was imposed on DSK. The criminal trial verdicts 
against both the DSK trader and against DSK were overturned on appeal in a decision rendered by the Seoul High Court in 
December  2018.  The  Korean  Prosecutor’s  Office’s  appeal  of  the  Seoul  High  Court  decision  was  finally  dismissed  by  the 
Supreme Court of South Korea on December 21, 2023. 

In addition, a number of civil actions have been filed in Korean courts against Deutsche Bank and DSK by certain parties who 
allege they incurred losses as a consequence of the fall in the KOSPI 200. The one outstanding claim was finally dismissed 
by the Supreme Court of South Korea on December 21, 2023. 

Monte Dei Paschi. In March 2013, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) initiated civil proceedings in Italy against Deutsche 
Bank alleging that Deutsche Bank assisted former MPS senior management in an accounting fraud on MPS, by undertaking 
repo transactions with MPS and “Santorini”, a wholly owned special-purpose vehicle of MPS, which helped MPS defer losses 
on a previous transaction undertaken with Deutsche Bank. In December 2013, Deutsche Bank reached an agreement with 
MPS to settle the civil proceedings and the transactions were unwound.  

A criminal investigation was launched by the Siena Public Prosecutor into the transactions entered into by MPS with Deutsche 
Bank and certain unrelated transactions entered into by MPS with other parties. Such investigation was moved in summer 
2014  from  Siena  to  the  Milan  Public  Prosecutors  as  a  result  of  a  change  in  the  alleged  charges  being  investigated.  In 
October 2016, the Milan court committed all defendants in the criminal proceedings to trial.  

In November 2019, the Milan court issued its verdicts, finding five former employees and one current employee of Deutsche 
Bank guilty and sentencing them to either 3 years and 6 months or 4 years and 8 months. Deutsche Bank was found liable 
under Italian Legislative Decree n. 231/2001 and the court ordered the seizure of alleged profits of € 64.9 million and a fine of 
€ 3 million. The Court also found Deutsche Bank had civil vicarious liability for damages (to be quantified by the civil court) as 
an  employer  of  the  current  and  former  employees  who  were  convicted.  The  sentences  and  fines  were  not  due  until  the 
conclusion of any appeal process. Following appeals filed by Deutsche Bank and the six former or current employees, in 2022, 
the Milan Court of Appeal acquitted all the Deutsche Bank defendants from all the charges, found Deutsche bank not liable 
under  Italian  Legislative  Decree  n.  231/2001,  revoked  the  confiscation  of  € 64.9 million  and  the  fine  of  € 3 million  ordered 
against Deutsche Bank, and revoked the finding of civil vicarious liability for damages. The Public Prosecutor filed an appeal 
against the Milan Court of Appeal verdicts before the Supreme Court in November 2022. On October 11, 2023, the Supreme 
Court declared the Public Prosecutor’s appeal inadmissible and confirmed the acquittal decisions of the Milan Court of Appeal, 
which  are  now  therefore  final.  While  the  criminal  proceedings  are  concluded,  there  nonetheless  remains  the  possibility  of 
potential future civil claims. 

In May 2018, CONSOB, the authority responsible for regulating the Italian financial markets, issued fines of € 100,000 each 
against  the  six  current and  former  employees  of  Deutsche Bank  who  are defendants in  the  criminal  proceedings. The  six 
individuals were also banned from performing management functions in Italy and for Italian based institutions for three to six 
months each. No separate fine or sanction was imposed on Deutsche Bank, but it is jointly and severally liable for the six 
current/former Deutsche Bank employees’ fines. In June 2018, Deutsche Bank and the six individuals filed an appeal in the 
Milan Court of Appeal challenging CONSOB’s decision. In December 2020, the Milan Court of Appeal allowed the appeals 
filed by Deutsche Bank and the six current and former employees and annulled the resolution sanctioning them. CONSOB 
filed an appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision in June 2021. Deutsche Bank and the six individuals have opposed 
the appeal. 

The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because 
it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.

Mortgage-Related and Asset-Backed Securities – Issuer and Underwriter Civil Litigation. Deutsche Bank has been named as 
defendant  in  numerous  civil  litigations  brought  by  private  parties  in  connection  with  its  various  roles,  including  issuer  or 
underwriter, in offerings of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and other asset-backed securities. These cases, 
described  below,  allege  that  the  offering  documents  contained  material  misrepresentations  and  omissions,  including  with 
regard to the underwriting standards pursuant to which the underlying mortgage loans were issued, or  assert that various 
representations or warranties relating to the loans were breached at the time of origination. The Group has recorded provisions 
with respect to several of these civil cases, but has not recorded provisions with respect to all of these matters. The Group 
has not disclosed the amount of these provisions because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice 
seriously the resolution of these matters. 

Deutsche Bank is a defendant in an action related to RMBS offerings brought by the FDIC as receiver for Citizens National 
Bank  and  Strategic  Capital  Bank  (alleging  an  unspecified  amount  in  damages  against  all  defendants).  In  this  action,  the 
appellate  court  reinstated  claims  previously  dismissed  on  statute  of  limitations  grounds,  and  petitions  for  rehearing  and 
certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied. In May 2022, the FDIC voluntarily dismissed its claim with respect to one 
of the RMBS offerings and Deutsche Bank filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the remaining claim. 
Deutsche Bank's motion has been fully briefed as of July 2022. Discovery is stayed pending resolution of Deutsche Bank's 
motion. 

Deutsche  Bank  is  a  defendant  in  cases  concerning  two  RMBS  trusts  that  were  brought  initially  by  RMBS  investors  and 
subsequently by HSBC, as trustee, in New York state court. The cases allege breaches of Deutsche Bank’s purported duty to 
notify the trustee of breaches of loan-level representations and warranties in the ACE Securities Corp. 2006-FM1 and ACE 
Securities Corp. 2007-ASAP1 RMBS offerings, respectively. The cases originally asserted claims against Deutsche Bank for 
breaches of representations and warranties, but those claims were dismissed as untimely, and the appellate court affirmed in 
April 2019. Discovery is ongoing.  

In October 2019, plaintiffs filed two complaints (one by HSBC as trustee and one by  certificate holders) seeking to revive, 
under Section 205(a) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, the untimely breach of representations and warranties 
claims as to which dismissal was affirmed in the case concerning ACE 2006-FM1. The trial court dismissed the certificate 
holder action, and the First Department affirmed in 2022. The certificate holders filed a motion for leave to appeal to the Court 
of Appeals, which was denied on February 20, 2024. The trial court also dismissed the trustee revival action filed by HSBC. 
In November 2022, HSBC filed an appeal that remains pending. 

In  the  actions  against  Deutsche  Bank  solely  as  an  underwriter  of  other  issuers’  RMBS  offerings,  Deutsche  Bank  has 
contractual  rights  to  indemnification  from  the  issuers,  but  those  indemnity  rights  may  in  whole  or  in  part  prove  effectively 
unenforceable where the issuers are now or may in the future be in bankruptcy or otherwise defunct.  

Mortgage-Related and Asset-Backed Securities – Trustee Civil Litigation. Deutsche Bank’s U.S. subsidiaries Deutsche Bank 
National Trust Company (DBNTC) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (DBTCA) (collectively, the “Trustees”) are 
defendants in two separate civil lawsuits, and DBNTC is a defendant in a third civil lawsuit, brought by investors concerning 
the Trustees’ role as trustees of certain RMBS trusts. The actions generally allege claims for breach of contract, breach of 
fiduciary duty, breach of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, negligence and/or violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 
1939, based on the Trustees’ alleged failure to perform adequately certain obligations and/or duties as trustee for the trusts.  

The three lawsuits include actions by (a) the National Credit Union Administration Board (NCUA), as an investor in 18 trusts 
that allegedly suffered total realized collateral losses of more than U.S. $ 3.7 billion; (b) Commerzbank AG, as an investor in 
50  RMBS  trusts,  alleging  hundreds  of millions  of  dollars  in  losses;  and  (c)  IKB  International,  S.A.  in  liquidation  and  IKB 
Deutsche  Industriebank  A.G.  (collectively,  “IKB”),  as  an  investor  in  15  RMBS  trusts,  originally  seeking  more  than  U.S. 
$ 268 million of damages before IKB voluntarily discontinued its claims as to certain RMBS certificates. In the NCUA case, 
DBNTC’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part, dismissing NCUA’s tort claims but 
preserving its breach-of-contract claims. Both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment, and those motions are fully 
briefed and pending before the court. In February 2022, the court in the Commerzbank case granted in part and denied in part 
DBNTC’s and DBTCA’s motion for summary judgment, dismissing all of the tort claims and dismissing the breach of contract 
claims relating to certain of the trusts, and denied Commerzbank’s motion for summary judgment in its entirety. Discovery is 
ongoing.  In  January 2021,  the  court  in  the  IKB  case  granted  in  part  and  denied  in  part  the  Trustees’  motion  to  dismiss, 
dismissing certain of IKB’s claims but allowing certain of its breach of contract and tort claims to go forward; the Trustees 
appealed certain aspects of that order, and IKB cross-appealed with respect to other aspects. In August 2022, the New York 
Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court’s order on the motion 
to dismiss. DBNTC and DBTCA appealed certain aspects of the First Department’s decision. On June 15, 2023, the New York 
Court  of  Appeals  modified  the  First  Department’s  decision  in  part,  dismissing  certain  additional  contract  claims  and  IKB’s 
remaining tort claims. Discovery is ongoing. 

The Group has established contingent liabilities with respect to certain of these matters, but the Group has not disclosed the 
amounts because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of these matters.

Polish Mortgage Matters. Starting in 2016, certain clients of Deutsche Bank Polska S.A. have reached out to Deutsche Bank 
Polska S.A. alleging that their mortgage loan agreements in foreign currency include unfair clauses and are invalid. These 
clients have demanded reimbursement of the alleged overpayments under such agreements totaling over € 685 million with 
over 5000 civil claims having been commenced in Polish courts as of February 29, 2024. These cases are an industry wide 
issue  in  Poland  and  other  banks  are  facing  similar  claims.  Deutsche  Bank  Polska  S.A.  has  and  will  take  necessary  legal 
actions to defend itself and challenge such claims in courts.  

During 2023, there was a deterioration in the risk profile with respect to the Polish FX mortgage portfolio, especially following 
an adverse decision by the European Court of Justice on June 15, 2023, which affected the broader Polish banking sector. In 
addition, the bank refined its model for estimating the provision in the third quarter for the expected development of court 
verdicts and other market parameters. As a result, the provision for this matter increased by € 244 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2023, and the total provision as of December 31, 2023 is € 534 million. 

Postbank  Voluntary  Public  Takeover  Offer.  On  September 12,  2010,  Deutsche  Bank  announced  the  decision  to  make  a 
voluntary takeover offer for the acquisition of all shares in Deutsche Postbank AG (Postbank). On October 7, 2010, the bank 
published its official takeover offer and offered Postbank shareholders a consideration of € 25 for each Postbank share. This 
offer was accepted for a total of approximately 48.2 million Postbank shares.  

In November 2010, a former shareholder of Postbank, Effecten-Spiegel AG, which had accepted the takeover offer, brought 
a  claim  against  Deutsche  Bank  alleging  that  the  offer  price  was  too  low  and  was  not  determined  in  accordance  with  the 
applicable German laws. The plaintiff alleges that Deutsche Bank had been obliged to make a mandatory takeover offer for 
all shares in Postbank, at the latest, in 2009 as the voting rights of  Deutsche Post AG in Postbank had to be attributed to 
Deutsche Bank pursuant to Section 30 of the German Takeover Act. Based thereon, the plaintiff alleges that the consideration 
offered by Deutsche Bank for the shares in Postbank in the 2010 voluntary takeover offer needed to be raised to € 57.25 per 
share. 

The Regional Court Cologne (Landgericht) dismissed the claim in 2011 and the Cologne appellate court dismissed the appeal 
in 2012. The Federal Court set this judgment aside and referred the case back to the Higher Regional Court Cologne to take 
evidence on certain allegations of the plaintiff. 

Starting in 2014, additional former shareholders of Postbank, who accepted the 2010 tender offer, brought similar claims as 
Effecten-Spiegel AG against Deutsche Bank which were pending with the Regional Court Cologne and the Higher Regional 
Court of Cologne, respectively. On October 20, 2017, the Regional Court Cologne handed down a decision granting the claims 
in a total of 14 cases which were combined in one proceeding. The Regional Court Cologne took the view that Deutsche Bank 
was obliged to make a mandatory takeover offer already in 2008 so that the appropriate consideration to be offered in the 
takeover offer should have been € 57.25 per Postbank share (instead of € 25). The additional consideration per share owed 
to shareholders which have accepted the takeover offer would thus amount to € 32.25. Deutsche Bank appealed this decision 
to the Higher Regional Court of Cologne. 

In 2019 and 2020 the Higher Regional Court Cologne heard a number of witnesses in both cases and issued orders for the 
production of relevant transaction documents entered into between Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Post AG in 2008 and 2009.  

On  December 16,  2020,  the  Higher  Regional  Court  Cologne  handed  down  a  decision  and  fully  dismissed  the  claims  of 
Effecten-Spiegel AG. Further, in a second decision handed down on December 16, 2020, the Higher Regional Court Cologne 
granted  the  appeal  of  Deutsche  Bank  against  the  decision  of  the  Regional  Court  Cologne  dated  October 20,  2017  and 
dismissed all claims of the plaintiffs. All relevant plaintiffs lodged appeals with the German Federal Court (Bundesgerichtshof) 
which on December 13, 2022 announced its decision, setting aside the judgments of the Higher Regional Court of Cologne 
and remanding the cases back to the Higher Regional Court of Cologne. The Higher Regional Court of Cologne scheduled a 
hearing for April 26, 2024. 

Deutsche Bank has been served with a large number of additional lawsuits filed against Deutsche Bank shortly before the end 
of 2017, almost all of which are now pending with the Regional Court Cologne. Some of the new plaintiffs allege that the 
consideration offered by Deutsche Bank for the shares in Postbank in the 2010 voluntary takeover should be raised to € 64.25 
per share. 

The claims for payment against Deutsche Bank in relation to these matters total almost € 700 million (excluding interest, which 
is significant due to the long duration of the proceedings). 

The Group has established a contingent liability with respect to these matters, but the Group has not disclosed the amount of 
this contingent liability because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously the outcome of 
these matters.

27 – Provisions 

The legal question of whether Deutsche Bank had been obliged to make a mandatory takeover offer for all Postbank shares 
prior to its 2010 voluntary takeover may impact two pending appraisal proceedings (Spruchverfahren). These proceedings 
were initiated by former Postbank shareholders with the aim to increase the cash compensation offered in connection with the 
squeeze-out  of  Postbank  shareholders  in 2015  and  the  cash  compensation  offered  and  annual  compensation  paid  in 
connection with the execution of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabführungs-
vertrag) between DB Finanz-Holding AG (now DB Beteiligungs-Holding GmbH) and Postbank in 2012.  

The applicants in the appraisal proceedings claim that a potential obligation of Deutsche Bank to make a mandatory takeover 
offer for Postbank at an offer price of € 57.25 should be decisive when determining the adequate cash compensation in the 
appraisal proceedings. The Regional Court Cologne had originally followed this legal view of the applicants in two resolutions. 
In a decision dated June 2019, the Regional Court Cologne expressly gave up this legal view in the appraisal proceedings in 
connection with the execution of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement. According to this decision, the question 
whether Deutsche Bank was obliged to make a mandatory offer for all Postbank shares prior to its voluntary takeover offer 
in 2010 shall not be relevant for determining the appropriate cash compensation. It is likely that the Regional Court Cologne 
will take the same legal position in the appraisal proceedings in connection with the squeeze-out. On October 1, 2020, the 
Regional Court Cologne handed down a decision in the appraisal proceeding concerning the domination and profit and loss 
transfer agreement (dated December 5, 2012) according to which the annual compensation pursuant to Section 304 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (jährliche Ausgleichszahlung) shall be increased by € 0.12 to € 1.78 per Postbank share and 
the settlement amount pursuant to Section 305 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Abfindungsbetrag) shall be increased 
by € 4.56 to € 29.74 per Postbank share. The increase of the settlement amount is of relevance for approximately 492,000 
former Postbank shares whereas the increase of the annual compensation is of relevance for approximately 7 million former 
Postbank shares. Deutsche Bank as well as the applicants have lodged an appeal against this decision. 

The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to this matter because 
it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously its outcome.  

RusChemAlliance  Litigation.  In  June  2023,  RusChemAlliance  LLC  (RCA),  a  Russian  joint  venture  of  Gazprom  PJSC  and 
RusGasDobycha  JSC,  filed  a  claim  against  Deutsche  Bank  before  a  commercial  state  court  in  Saint  Petersburg.  A  court 
hearing took place on October 31, 2023. A further hearing on the merits has been scheduled for April 16, 2024. RCA is seeking 
payment of approximately € 238 million (excluding interest) under an advance payment guarantee (APG) issued by Deutsche 
Bank in 2021 at the request of one of its clients, with RCA named as beneficiary. 

RCA made a payment demand under the APG which was rejected by Deutsche Bank due to the imposition of EU sanctions 
against Russia. The Russian court has accepted this claim and assumed jurisdiction contrary to the contractual arrangements 
in the APG which provide for arbitration in Paris. It can thus be assumed that the Russian court will also not recognize the 
applicability  of  the  EU  sanctions.  Deutsche Bank  maintains  assets  in  Russia  which  could  be  seized  if  the  claim would  be 
granted  and  enforced.  Deutsche  Bank  is  entitled  to  indemnification  from  its  client  with  respect  to  the  bank’s  payment 
obligations  under  the  advance  payment  guarantee  and  the  legal  fees  and  costs  related  to  the  court  proceedings  and  the 
enforcement  of  a  negative  court  decision.  Deutsche  Bank  has  recognized  a  provision  in  the  amount  of  approximately 
€ 260 million  and  a  corresponding  reimbursement  asset  under  the  indemnification  agreement.  The  expense  from  the 
recognition of the provision is offset by the income from the recognition of the reimbursement asset. 

Sovereign, Supranational and Agency Bonds (SSA) Investigations and Litigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries from 
certain regulatory and law enforcement authorities, including requests for information and documents, pertaining to SSA bond 
trading. Deutsche Bank is cooperating with these investigations. 

On May 24, 2023, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) sent a statement of objections to Deutsche Bank regarding 
a potential breach of United Kingdom antitrust rules in relation to the sale, secondary market trading and buy-back auctions 
of United Kingdom government bonds, which includes Gilts and Gilt asset swaps, between 2009 and 2013. Deutsche Bank 
proactively cooperated with the CMA in this matter and as a result has been granted full provisional immunity. The sending of 
a statement of objections is a step in the CMA’s investigation and does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation, which 
is ongoing. 

On November 22, 2023, the European Commission announced its decision that Deutsche Bank and one other bank in the 
past breached EU antitrust rules in relation to secondary market trading of Euro-denominated SSA bonds, and to a very limited 
extent  government  guaranteed  bonds.  Deutsche  Bank  has  proactively  cooperated  with  the  European  Commission  in  this 
matter and, as a result, has been granted full immunity. In accordance with the European Commission’s guidelines, no financial 
penalty was imposed on Deutsche Bank. The timeframe of the alleged infringement ended in 2016.

In 2021, Deutsche Bank was notified that the Mexican competition authority, COFECE, reached  a resolution that imposes 
fines against DB Mexico and two of its former traders, as well as six other financial institutions and nine other traders, for 
engaging in alleged monopolistic practices in the Mexican government bond secondary market. DB Mexico has appealed. 
The fine against DB Mexico was approximately U.S. $ 427,000. 

Deutsche Bank is a defendant in a putative class action filed on June 16, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY by 
alleged direct market participants claiming a violation of antitrust law related to alleged manipulation of the secondary trading 
market for United Kingdom government bonds. The complaint seeks treble damages and attorneys’ fees. The case is in the 
early stages. 

Deutsche Bank is a defendant in a putative class action filed in December 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY by 
alleged direct market participants claiming a violation of antitrust law related to alleged manipulation of the secondary trading 
market for Euro-denominated Sovereign bonds. The complaint seeks treble damages and attorneys’ fees. The case is in the 
early stages. 

Deutsche Bank is also a defendant in putative class actions filed in 2017 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and Federal 
Court of Canada, respectively, claiming violations of antitrust law and the common law relating to alleged manipulation of 
secondary trading of SSA bonds. The complaints seek compensatory and punitive damages. On July 20, 2022, Deutsche 
Bank entered into a national settlement agreement that would resolve the Canadian Federal SSA claim against all Deutsche 
Bank defendants. The settlement agreement remains subject to approval by the Federal Court of Canada. 

Deutsche Bank was named as a defendant in a consolidated putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY 
alleging  violations  of  U.S.  antitrust  law  and  a  claim  for  unjust  enrichment  relating  to  Mexican  government  bond  trading. 
Defendants’  motion  to  dismiss  plaintiffs’  consolidated  amended  complaint  was  granted  without  prejudice.  Plaintiffs  filed  a 
second amended complaint naming only Mexico-based defendants, which was also dismissed without prejudice. Plaintiffs 
appealed to the Second Circuit, and on February 9, 2024, the dismissal of the complaint was reversed. 

Other than as noted above, the Group has not disclosed whether it has established provisions or contingent liabilities with 
respect to the matters referred to above because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously 
their outcome.  

U.S. Treasury Securities Investigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries from certain regulatory and law enforcement 
authorities,  including  requests for  information  and  documents,  pertaining  to  U.S.  Treasuries  auctions,  trading,  and  related 
market activity. Deutsche Bank has cooperated with these investigations.  

Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., the bank’s primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary (DBSI), was a defendant in several putative 
class  actions  alleging  violations  of  U.S.  antitrust  law,  the  U.S.  Commodity  Exchange  Act  and  common  law  related  to  the 
alleged manipulation of the U.S. Treasury securities market. These cases have been consolidated in the SDNY. In 2017, the 
court  dismissed  DBSI  from  the  class  action  without  prejudice.  Defendants  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  a  second  amended 
complaint, which was granted. Plaintiffs’ notice of appeal to the Second Circuit remains pending. 

In  2020,  the  CFTC  entered  an  order  pursuant  to  settlement  with  DBSI  for  alleged  spoofing  by  two  Tokyo-based  traders 
between  January  and  December  2013. Without  admitting  or  denying  the  findings  or  conclusions  therein,  Deutsche  Bank 
consented to the entry of the order, including a civil monetary fine.  

The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because 
it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice their outcome. 

U.S. Treasury Spoofing Litigation. Following the bank’s settlement with the CFTC mentioned above, five separate putative 
class actions were filed in the Northern District of Illinois against Deutsche Bank AG and DBSI. The cases allege that Deutsche 
Bank and other unnamed entities participated in a scheme from January to December 2013 to spoof the market for Treasuries 
futures and  options  contracts  and  Eurodollar futures  and  options  contracts.  Following  briefing  on  a  motion  to  dismiss, the 
judge ordered supplemental briefing on the issues of standing and jurisdictional discovery, which has now been substantially 
completed. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and then a further, second amended complaint. Deutsche Bank AG and 
DBSI filed a motion to dismiss on September 12, 2023 and a reply on December 13, 2023. 

The Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because 
it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.

In  the  normal  course  of  business  the  Group  regularly  enters  into  irrevocable  lending  commitments,  including  fronting 
commitments as well as contingent liabilities consisting of financial and performance guarantees, standby letters of credit and 
indemnity agreements on behalf of its customers. Under these contracts the Group is required to perform under an obligation

it is not known to the Group in detail if, when and to what extent claims will be made. In the event that the Group has to pay 
out cash in respect of its fronting commitments, the Group would immediately seek reimbursement from the other syndicate 
lenders. The Group considers all the above instruments in monitoring the credit exposure and may require collateral to mitigate 
inherent credit risk. If the credit risk monitoring provides sufficient perception about a loss from an expected claim, a provision 
is established and recorded on the balance sheet. 

The following table shows the Group’s revocable lending commitments, irrevocable lending commitments and lending related 
contingent liabilities without considering collateral or provisions. It shows the maximum potential utilization of the Group  in 
case all these liabilities entered into must be fulfilled. The table therefore does not show the expected future cash flows from 
these liabilities as many of them will expire without being drawn and arising claims will be honored by the customers or can 
be recovered from proceeds of arranged collateral.

Other commitments and other contingent liabilities 

The  Group’s  other  irrevocable  commitments  and  other  contingent  liabilities  without  considering  collateral  or  provisions 
amounted to € 74.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and to € 73.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The number considers 
the maximum potential utilization of the Group in case all these liabilities entered into must be fulfilled. It therefore does not 
contain the expected future cash flows from these liabilities as many of them will expire without being drawn and arising claims 
will be honored by the customers or can be recovered from proceeds of arranged collateral. 

Government assistance 

In the course of its business, the Group regularly applies for and receives government support by means of Export Credit 
Agency (“ECA”) guarantees covering transfer and default risks for the financing of exports and investments into Emerging 
Markets and to a lesser extent, developed markets for Structured Trade & Export Finance and short- and medium-term Trade 
Finance business. Almost all export-oriented states have established such ECAs to support their domestic exporters. The 
ECAs  act  in  the  name  and  on  behalf  of  the  government  of  their  respective  country  and  are  either  constituted  directly  as 
governmental departments or organized as private companies vested with the official mandate of the government to act on its 
behalf. Terms and conditions of such ECA guarantees are broadly similar due to the fact that most of the ECAs act within the 
scope of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) consensus rules. The OECD consensus 
rules,  an  intergovernmental  agreement  of  the  OECD  member  states,  define  benchmarks  intended  to  ensure  that  a  fair 
competition between different exporting nations will take place. 

In some countries dedicated funding programs with governmental support are offered for ECA-covered financings. The Group 
makes use of such programs to assist its clients in the financing of exported goods and services. In certain financings, the 
Group also receives government guarantees from national and international governmental institutions as collateral to support 
financings in the interest of the respective governments. The majority of such ECA guarantees received by the Group were 
issued either by the Euler-Hermes S.A. acting on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany, by the Atradius Credito y Caucion 
S.A. de Seguros y Reaseguros acting on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain or by the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation acting 
on behalf of the Republic of Korea.

28 – Credit related commitments and contingent liabilities 

Irrevocable payment commitments with regard to levies and deposit protection 

Certain entities of the Group are required to make contributions to national resolution authorities or deposit protection schemes 
such as the European Single Resolution Fund (SRF) of the Single Resolution Board (SRB). Part of such contributions may be 
provided in the form of irrevocable payment commitments (IPCs) backed by cash and securities collateral. 

IPCs related to the bank levy according to the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the SRF and the deposit 
protection provided by the German deposit protection fund amounted to € 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 
2022: € 1.3 billion). Thereof € 1.0 billion of IPCs related to the SRF (December 31, 2022: € 0.9 billion). 

During 2023, the Group provided additional IPCs of € 119 million to the SRF and € 54 million to the German deposit protection 
fund, respectively.  

As of December 31, 2023, the total collateral consisted of € 1.4 billion of cash collateral and € 81 million of securities collateral 
(December 31,  2022:  € 1.2 billion  and  € 78 million  respectively).  Thereof  € 1.0 billion  of  cash  collateral  related  to  the  SRF 
(December 31, 2022: € 0.9 billion). 

The Group accounts for IPCs as contingent liabilities as it is not deemed probable that IPCs will be called. Also, the Group 
remains the economic owner of the collateral provided. 

In October 2023, in a matter unrelated to the Group, the General Court of the EU handed down a judgement which supported 
the SRB in its view that in case an entity that no longer falls within the scope of the Single Resolution Mechanism, its IPCs 
are cancelled and collateral backing these commitments is only returned if the entity pays a cash contribution to the SRF at 
the same amount. The plaintiff filed an appeal against this judgement to the Court of Justice of the EU in January 2024. The 
Group is of the view that its accounting analysis for IPCs with regard to the SRF and deposit protection remains unaffected as 
of December 31, 2023, and continues to monitor the legal developments and their potential accounting impact.

Common Shares 

Deutsche Bank’s share capital consists of common shares issued in registered form without par value. Under German law, 
each share represents an equal stake in the subscribed capital. Therefore, each share has a nominal value of € 2.56, derived 
by dividing the total amount of share capital by the number of shares.

There are no issued ordinary shares that have not been fully paid. 

The  Group  has  bought  back  shares  pursuant  to  share  buyback  authorizations  by  the  Annual  General  Meetings.  All  such 
transactions were recorded in shareholders’ equity and no revenues and expenses were recorded in connection with these 
activities. Treasury stock held as of year-end will mainly be used for cancellation with the purpose of distributing capital to 
shareholders as well as for future share-based compensation. 

Authorized Capital 

The  Management  Board  is  authorized  to  increase  the  share  capital  by  issuing  new  shares  for  cash  consideration.  As  of 
December 31, 2023, Deutsche Bank AG had authorized but unissued capital of € 2,560,000,000 which may be issued in whole

Share-Based Compensation Plans  

The  Group  made  grants  of  share-based  compensation  under  the  Deutsche  Bank  Equity  Plan.  This  plan  represents  a 
contingent right to receive Deutsche Bank common shares after a specified period of time. The award recipient is not entitled 
to receive dividends during the vesting period of the award. 

The share awards granted under the terms and conditions of the Deutsche Bank Equity Plan may be forfeited fully or partly if 
the recipient voluntarily terminates employment before the end of the relevant vesting period (or release period for Upfront 
Awards).  Vesting  usually  continues  after termination  of  employment  in  cases  such  as  redundancy  or retirement.  Deferred 
share awards are subject to forfeiture provisions and performance conditions until release. 

In countries where legal or other restrictions hinder the delivery of shares, a cash plan variant of the Deutsche Bank Equity 
Plan was  used for granting  awards,  and  for employees  of  certain  legal  entities,  deferred equity  is  replaced  with  restricted 
shares due to local regulatory requirements. 

Please note that this table does not cover awards granted to the Management Board. For awards granted under the DWS 
Equity Plan, please refer to the DWS Share-Based Compensation Plans section.

Furthermore,  the  Group  offers  a  broad-based  employee  share  ownership  plan  entitled  Global  Share  Purchase  Plan.  The 
Global  Share  Purchase  Plan  offers employees  in  specific  countries  the  opportunity  to  purchase  Deutsche Bank  shares in 
monthly installments over one year. At the end of the purchase cycle, the Group matches the acquired stock in a ratio of one 
to one up to a maximum of ten free shares, provided that the employee remains at Deutsche Bank Group for another year. In 
total, 11,603 staff from 18 countries enrolled in the cycle that began in November 2023. 

The Group has other local share-based compensation plans, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, are material to 
the consolidated financial statements.

Share-based  payment  transactions  resulting  in  a  cash  payment  give  rise  to  a  liability,  which  amounted  to  approximately 
€ 12 million and € 9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

The grant volume of outstanding share awards was approximately € 1.1 billion and € 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 
2022, respectively. Thereof, approximately € 0.8 billion and € 0.8 billion had been recognized as compensation expense in 
the reporting year or prior to that. Hence, compensation expense for deferred share-based compensation not yet recognized 
amounted to approximately € 0.3 billion and € 0.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

DWS Share-Based Compensation Plans 

The DWS Group made grants of share-based compensation under the DWS Equity Plan. This plan represents a contingent 
right to receive a cash payment by referencing to the value of DWS shares during a specified time period. 

In September 2018 one-off IPO related awards under the DWS Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan were granted to all 
DWS employees. A limited number of DWS senior managers were granted a one-off IPO-related Performance Share Unit 
under the DWS Equity Plan instead. For members of the Executive Board, one-off IPO-related awards under the DWS Equity 
Plan were granted in January 2019. 

The DWS Stock Appreciation Rights Plan represents a contingent right to receive a cash payment equal to any appreciation 
(or gain) in the value of a set number of notional DWS shares over a fixed period of time. This award does not provide any 
entitlement to receive DWS shares, voting rights or associated dividends. 

The DWS Equity Plan is a phantom share plan representing a contingent right to receive a cash payment by referencing to 
the value of DWS shares during a specified period of time.  

The award recipient for any share-based compensation plan is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period of 
the award. 

The share awards granted under the terms and conditions of any share-based compensation plan are forfeited fully or partly 
if the recipient voluntarily terminates employment before the end of the relevant vesting period (or the end of the retention 
period  for  Upfront  Awards).  Vesting  usually  continues  after  termination  of  employment  in  cases  such  as  redundancy  or 
retirement.

The fair value of outstanding share-based awards was approximately € 72 million and € 67 million as of December 31, 2023 
and  2022,  respectively.  Of  the  awards,  approximately  € 62 million  and  € 58 million  has  been  recognized  in  the  income 
statement up to the period ending 2023 and 2022 respectively, of which € 42 million and € 25 million as of December 31, 2023 
and  2022  relate  to  fully  vested  awards.  Total  unrecognized  expense  related  to  share-based  plans  was  approximately 
€ 9 million and € 10 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, dependent on future share price development. 

The fair value of the DWS Stock Appreciation Rights Plan awards have been measured using the generalized Black-Scholes 
model. The liabilities incurred are re-measured at the end of each reporting period until settlement. The principal inputs being 
the  market  value  on  reporting  date,  discounted  for  any  dividends  foregone  over  the  holding  periods  of  the  award,  and 
adjustment for expected and actual levels of vesting which includes estimating the number of eligible employees leaving the 
Group and number of employees eligible for early retirement. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at grant 
date and measurement date were as follows.

Post-employment Benefit Plans 

Nature of Plans 

The Group sponsors a number of post-employment benefit plans on behalf of its employees, both defined contribution plans 
and defined benefit plans. The Group’s plans are accounted for based on the nature and substance of the plan. Generally, for 
defined benefit plans the value of a participant’s accrued benefit is based on each employee’s remuneration and length of 
service; contributions to defined contribution plans are typically based on a percentage of each employee’s remuneration. The 
rest of this note focuses predominantly on the Group’s defined benefit plans. 

The Group’s defined benefit plans are primarily described on a geographical basis, reflecting differences in the nature and 
risks of benefits, as well as in the respective regulatory environments. In particular, the requirements set by local regulators 
can vary significantly and determine the design and financing of the benefit plans to a certain extent. Key information is also 
shown based on participant status, which provides a broad indication of the maturity of the Group’s obligations.

The majority of the Group’s defined benefit plan obligations relate to Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
Within the other countries, the largest obligation relates to Switzerland. In Germany and some continental European countries, 
post-employment benefits are usually agreed on a collective basis with respective employee workers councils, unions or their 
equivalent. The Group’s main pension plans are governed by boards of trustees, fiduciaries or their equivalent.  

Post-employment benefits can form an important part of an employee’s total remuneration. The Group’s approach is that their 
design shall be attractive to employees in the respective market, but sustainable for the Group to provide over the longer term. 
At the same time, the Group tries to limit its risks related to provision of such benefits. Consequently, the Group has moved 
to offer defined contribution plans in many locations over recent years. 

In the past the Group typically offered pension plans based on final pay prior to retirement. These types of benefits still form 
a significant part of the pension obligations for participants in deferred and payment status. Currently, in Germany and the 
United States, the main defined benefit pension plans for active staff are cash account type plans where the Group credits an 
annual  amount  to  individual  accounts  based  on  an  employee’s  current  compensation.  Dependent  on  the  plan  rules,  the 
accounts increase either at a fixed interest rate or participate in market movements of certain underlying investments to limit 
the investment risk for the Group. Sometimes, in particular in Germany, there is a guaranteed benefit amount within the plan 
rules, e.g. payment of at least the amounts contributed. Upon retirement, beneficiaries may usually opt for a lump sum, a fixed 
number of annual instalments or for conversion of the accumulated account balance into a life annuity. This conversion is 
often based on market conditions and mortality assumptions at retirement. 

The Group also sponsors retirement and termination indemnity plans in several countries, as well as some post-employment 
medical plans for a number of current and retired employees, mainly in the United States. The post-employment medical plans 
typically pay fixed percentages of medical expenses of eligible retirees after a set deductible has been met. In the United 
States, once a retiree is eligible for Medicare, the Group contributes to a Health Reimbursement Account and the retiree is no 
longer eligible  for the Group’s medical program. The Group’s total defined benefit obligation for post-employment medical 
plans was € 145 million and € 144 million on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. In combination with 
the benefit structure, these plans represent limited risk for the Group, given the nature and size of the post-retirement medical 
plan liabilities versus the size of the Group’s balance sheet at year end 2023. 

The following amounts of expected benefit payments from the Group’s defined benefit plans include benefits attributable to 
employees’ past and estimated future service and include both amounts paid from the Group’s external pension trusts and 
paid directly by the Group in respect of unfunded plans.

Multi-employer Plans 

In  Germany,  the  Group  is  a  member  of  the  BVV  Versicherungsverein  des  Bankgewerbes  a.G.  (BVV)  together  with  other 
financial  institutions.  The  BVV  offers  retirement  benefits  to  eligible  employees  in  Germany  as  a  complement  to  post-
employment benefit promises of the Group. Both employers and employees contribute on a regular basis to the BVV. The 
BVV provides annuities of a fixed amount to individuals on retirement and increases these fixed amounts if surplus assets 
arise within the plan. According to legislation in Germany, the employer is ultimately liable for providing the benefits to its 
employees. An increase in benefits may also arise due to additional obligations to retirees for the effects of inflation. BVV is a 
multi-employer defined benefit plan. However, in line with industry practice, the Group accounts for it as a defined contribution 
plan  since  insufficient  information  is  available  to  identify  assets  and  liabilities  relating  to  the  Group’s  current  and  former 
employees, primarily because the BVV does not fully allocate plan assets to beneficiaries nor to member companies.  

Governance and Risk 

The Group maintains a Pensions Committee to oversee its pension and related risks on a global basis. This Committee meets 
at least quarterly and reports directly to the Senior Executive Compensation Committee. 

Within this context, the Group develops and maintains guidelines for governance and risk management, including funding, 
asset allocation and actuarial assumption setting.  

During and after acquisitions or changes in the external environment (e.g., legislation, taxation), topics such as the general 
plan design or potential plan amendments are considered. Any plan changes follow a process requiring approval by Group 
Human Resources and, above a certain threshold, also of the Pensions Committee.  

Pension risk management is embedded in the Group’s risk management organization, with strong focus on market risks given 
importance of capital market developments (e.g., interest rate, credit spread, price inflation) for the value of plan assets and 
liabilities, hence IFRS and regulatory capital. Risk management thereby encompasses regular measurement, monitoring and 
reporting of risks via specific metrics, as well as a risk control framework, e.g. via the establishment of risk limits or thresholds 
as applicable. Risk management activities also include the consideration, review and measurement of other financial risks, 
e.g. risks from demographic and other actuarial assumptions (e.g., longevity risk) but also the assessment of model, valuation 
and other non-financial risks. 

In  the  Group’s  key  pension countries,  the  Group’s  largest  post-employment benefit plan  risk exposures  relate  to  potential 
changes  in  credit  spreads,  interest  rates,  price  inflation  and  longevity,  that  are  partially  mitigated  through  the  investment 
strategy adopted. To the extent that pension plans are funded, the assets held mitigate some of the liability risks, but introduce 
investment risk. 

Overall, the Group seeks to minimize the impact of pensions on the Group’s financial position from market movements, subject 
to balancing the trade-offs involved in financing post-employment benefits, regulatory capital and constraints from local funding 
or accounting requirements.  

Funding 

The Group maintains various external pension trusts to fund the majority of its defined benefit plan obligations. The Group’s 
funding principle is to maintain funding of the defined benefit obligation by plan assets within a range of 90% to 100% of the 
obligation,  subject  to  meeting  any  local  statutory  requirements.  The  Group  has  also  determined  that  certain  plans  should 
remain  unfunded,  although  their  funding  approach  is  subject  to  periodic  review,  e.g.  when  local  regulations  or  practices 
change. Obligations for the Group’s unfunded plans are accrued on the balance sheet. 

For many of the externally funded defined benefit plans there are local minimum funding requirements. The Group can decide 
on any additional plan contributions, with reference to the Group’s funding principle. There are some locations, e.g. the United 
Kingdom, where the trustees and the Group jointly agree contribution levels. In most countries the Group expects to receive 
an  economic  benefit  from  any  plan  surpluses  of  plan  assets  compared  to  defined  benefit  obligations,  typically  by  way  of 
reduced future contributions. Given the relatively high funding level and the investment strategy adopted in the Group’s key 
funded defined benefit plans, any minimum funding requirements that may apply are not expected to place the Group under 
any material adverse cash strain in the short term. With reference to the Group’s funding principle, the Group considers not 
re-claiming benefits paid from the Group’s assets as an equivalent to making cash contributions into the external pension 
trusts during the year.

During 2022, the majority of the German pension plans moved into surplus status due to significant market movements. The 
Group has claimed around € 860 million from the trust, which represents the benefits paid from the Bank’s assets on behalf 
of the trust during 2022 including the forgiven re-imbursement of the prior year in order to limit the extent to which the Group 
breached the upper end of its target funding ratio. During 2023, reimbursements of € 490 million were also claimed for the 
benefits paid from the Group’s assets on behalf of the trust.  

For post-retirement medical plans, the Group accrues for obligations over the period of employment and pays the benefits 
from Group assets when the benefits become due.  

Actuarial Methodology and Assumptions 

December 31 is the measurement date for all plans. All plans are valued by independent qualified actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. A Group policy provides guidance to ensure consistency globally on setting actuarial assumptions which 
are  finally  determined  by  the  Group’s  Pensions  Committee.  Senior  management  of  the  Group  is  regularly  informed  of 
movements and changes in key actuarial assumptions.  

The key actuarial assumptions applied in determining the defined benefit obligations on December 31 are presented below in 
the form of weighted averages.

For the Group’s most significant pension plans in the key countries, the discount rate used at each measurement date is set 
based on a high quality corporate bond yield curve, which is derived using a bond universe sourced from reputable third-party 
market data providers, and reflects the timing, amount and currency of the future expected benefit payments for the respective 
plan. In 2023, a refinement was made to the Eurozone discount curve methodology in order to better align to long term market 
data resulting in a benefit recognized in Other Comprehensive Income of € 70 million. 

The price inflation assumptions in the Eurozone and the United Kingdom are set with reference to market measures of inflation 
based on inflation swap rates in those markets at each measurement date. For other countries, the price inflation assumptions 
are typically based on long term forecasts by Consensus Economics Inc. 

The assumptions for the increases in future compensation levels and for increases to pensions in payment are developed 
separately for each plan, where relevant. Each is set based on the price inflation assumption and reflecting the Group’s reward 
structure or policies in each market, as well as relevant local statutory and plan-specific requirements. 

Among other assumptions, mortality assumptions can be significant in measuring the Group’s obligations under its defined 
benefit plans. These assumptions have been set in accordance with current best estimate in the respective countries. Future 
potential improvements in longevity have been considered and included where appropriate.

Investment Strategy 

The Group’s investment objective is to protect the Group from adverse impacts of its defined benefit pension plans on key 
financial metrics. The primary focus is to protect the plans’ IFRS funded status in the case of adverse market scenarios. Since 
2021,  there  has  been  a  shift  in  the  investment  strategy  in  selected  markets  to  balance  competing  key  financial  metrics. 
Investment managers manage pension assets in  line with investment  mandates  or guidelines  as  agreed with  the  pension 
plans’ trustees and investment committees. 

For key defined benefit plans for which the Group aims to protect the IFRS funded status, the Group applies a liability driven 
investment approach. Risks from mismatches between fluctuations in the present value of the defined benefit obligations and 
plan assets due to capital market movements are minimized, subject to balancing relevant trade-offs. This is achieved by 
allocating plan assets closely to the market risk factor exposures of the pension liability to interest rates, credit spreads and 
inflation. Thereby, plan assets broadly reflect the underlying risk profile and currency of the pension obligations.  

Where the desired hedging level for market risks cannot be achieved with physical instruments (i.e., corporate and government 
bonds), derivatives are employed. Derivative overlays mainly include interest rate, inflation swaps and credit default swaps. 
Other  instruments  are  also  used,  such  as  interest  rate  futures  and  options.  In  practice,  a  completely  hedged  approach  is 
impractical, for instance because of insufficient market depth for ultra-long-term corporate bonds, as well as liquidity and cost 
considerations. Therefore, plan assets contain further return-seeking asset categories such as equity, real estate, high yield 
bonds or emerging markets bonds to create long-term value and achieve diversification benefits. Furthermore, this shift in the 
investment strategy allows for actively taken market risk exposures from interest rates and credit spreads within defined limits 
governed by the Pensions Committee. As a result, the market risk from plan assets has been reduced. 

In 2023, the Group entered into a buy-in transaction with a third party insurer to de-risk € 515 million of exposure to the UK 
defined  benefit  pension  schemes  funded  from  existing  assets,  with  no  additional  employer  contribution  required.  The 
recognition of the insurance policy as a qualifying plan asset negatively impacted Other Comprehensive Income in the Group’s 
financial statement by approximately € 33 million. A similar buy-in transaction to de-risk € 410 million of exposure occurred in 
2022  which  negatively  impacted  Other  Comprehensive  Income  in  the  Group’s  financial  statement  by  approximately 
€ 35 million.  In  total,  the  Group has  entered  into  four  buy-in  transactions  in  the  UK with  third-party  insurers  protecting  the 
Group from movements in defined benefit obligations of around € 1.8 billion as at 31 December, 2023.  

Plan asset allocation to key asset classes 

The following table shows the asset allocation of the Group’s funded defined benefit plans to key asset classes, i.e. exposures 
include physical securities in discretely managed portfolios and underlying asset allocations of any commingled funds used to 
invest plan assets.  

Asset amounts in the following table include both “quoted” (i.e., Level 1 assets in accordance with IFRS 13 – amounts invested 
in markets where the fair value can be determined directly from prices which are quoted in active, liquid markets) and “other” 
(i.e., Level 2 and 3 assets in accordance with IFRS 13) assets.

Plan assets include derivative transactions with Group entities with an overall positive market value of around € 930 million at 
December 31, 2023 and € 1,250 million December 31, 2022, respectively. There is neither a material amount of securities 
issued by the Group nor other claims on Group assets included in the fair value of plan assets. The plan assets do not include 
any real estate which is used by the Group.

Key Risk Sensitivities 

The  Group’s  defined  benefit  obligations  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  capital  market  conditions  and  actuarial  assumptions. 
Sensitivities to capital market movements and key assumption changes are presented in the following table. Each market risk 
factor or assumption is changed in isolation. Sensitivities of the defined benefit obligations are approximated using geometric 
extrapolation methods based on plan durations for the respective assumption. Duration is a risk measure that indicates the 
broad sensitivity of the obligations to a change in an underlying assumption and provides a reasonable approximation for small 
to moderate changes in those assumptions. 

For example, the interest rate duration is derived from the change in the defined benefit obligation to a change in the interest 
rate based on information provided by the local actuaries of the respective plans. The resulting duration is used to estimate 
the remeasurement liability loss or gain from changes in the interest rate. For other assumptions, a similar approach is used 
to derive the respective sensitivity results. 

For  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  changes  in  capital  market  conditions  will  impact  the  plan  obligations  via  actuarial 
assumptions (e.g. via the discount rate and price inflation rate) as well as the plan assets’ fair value. Where the Group applies 
a liability driven investment approach or has insured part of the obligations as in the UK, the Group’s overall risk exposure to 
such changes is reduced. To help readers gain a better understanding of the Group’s risk exposures to key capital market 
movements, the net impact of the change in the defined benefit obligations and plan assets due to a change of the related 
market risk factor or underlying actuarial assumption is shown. Where changes in actuarial assumptions do not affect plan 
assets, only the impact on the defined benefit obligations is reported.  

Asset-related sensitivities are derived for the Group’s major plans by using risk sensitivity factors determined by the Group’s 
Market Risk Management function. These sensitivities are calculated based on information provided by the plans’ investment 
managers and extrapolated linearly to reflect the approximate change of the plan assets’ market value in case of a change in 
the underlying risk factor. 

The  sensitivities  illustrate  plausible  variations  over  time  in  capital  market  movements  and  key  actuarial  assumptions.  The 
Group is not in a position to provide a view on the likelihood of these capital market or assumption changes. While these 
sensitivities illustrate the overall impact on the funded status of the changes shown, the significance of the impact and the 
range of reasonable possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the aggregated 
results. Even though plan assets and plan obligations are sensitive to similar risk factors, actual changes in plan assets and 
obligations may not fully offset each other due to imperfect correlations between market risk factors and actuarial assumptions. 
Caution  should  be  used  when  extrapolating  these  sensitivities  due  to  non-linear  effects  that  changes  in  capital  market 
conditions and key actuarial assumptions may have on the overall funded status. Any management actions that may be taken 
to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-employment defined benefit plans are not reflected in these sensitivities.

Total  deferred  tax  expense/(benefit)  includes  benefits  from  previously  unrecognized  tax  losses  (tax  credits/deductible 
temporary differences) and the reversal of previous write-downs and expenses arising from write-downs of deferred tax assets. 
The deferred tax expense/(benefit) was positively impacted by € 1.1 billion in 2023, by € 1.4 billion in 2022 and by € 242 million 
in 2021. 

The Global Minimum Taxation Rules or Pillar Two rules are applicable to Deutsche Bank starting in 2024, with Deutsche Bank 
AG as the ultimate parent. Deutsche Bank is required to annually calculate the global minimum tax or Pillar Two liability for 
group  entities  in  close  to  60  jurisdictions.  However,  temporary  relief  from  the  detailed  Pillar  Two  calculations,  which  is 
determined on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, may be available under transitional safe harbor provisions. These safe harbor 
provisions apply to tax years 2024-2026 and are based on the bank’s country-by-country reports filed annually with the German 
tax authorities and certain other financial data. While uncertainties remain regarding the application of the Pillar Two rules, 
further legislative developments and interpretative guidance in many countries are expected over time, and implementation 
efforts are ongoing, Deutsche Bank has assessed the potential impact on its financial position for 2024 on a best effort basis. 
The assessment considered a number of qualitative and quantitative factors. For one, Deutsche Bank’s blended statutory tax 
rate across all applicable jurisdictions on average ranges between 28% to 30%, which is significantly higher than the minimum 
tax rate of 15%. For example, in 2023 the blended statutory rate amounted to 30%. In addition, of the close to 60 countries, 
six countries apply a statutory tax rate of less than 15% to the bank’s operations. Furthermore, based on an analysis of the 
most recently available country-by-country report, it is estimated that Deutsche Bank will qualify for relief under the transitional 
safe harbor provisions in most of the jurisdictions it operates in. As a result, Deutsche Bank estimates that it will not be subject 
to a material Pillar Two liability in 2024.

“Other” 

The domestic income tax rate, including corporate tax, solidarity surcharge, and trade tax, used for calculating deferred tax 
assets and liabilities was 31.3% for 2023, 2022 and 2021. 

Changes in recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets in 2022 and 2021 mainly included the effect of the recognition 
of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the U.S. and in 2023 mainly in the UK. In determining the amount of deferred 
tax assets, the Group uses historical tax capacity and profitability information and, if relevant, forecasted operating results 
based  upon  approved  business  plans,  including  a  review  of  the  eligible  carry-forward  periods,  available  tax  planning 
opportunities and other relevant considerations. 

The Group is under continuous examinations by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. “Other” in the preceding table includes 
the effects of these examinations by the tax authorities.

In August 2022, the U.S. enacted the corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). The CAMT is generally imposed at a rate of 
15%  on  profits  before  tax.  The  CAMT  is  not  expected  to  increase  the  bank’s  overall  tax  burden  but  may  accelerate  tax 
payments. The bank is subject to the CAMT rules starting in 2023. Deferred tax assets on unused tax credits in the preceding 
table include corporate alternative minimum tax credits of € 10 million as of December 31, 2023.

The change in the balance of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities might not equal the deferred tax expense/(benefit). 
In general, this is due to (1) deferred taxes that are booked directly to equity, (2) the effects of exchange rate changes on tax 
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than euro, (3) the acquisition and disposal of entities as part of ordinary 
activities and (4) the reclassification of deferred tax assets and liabilities which are presented otherwise on the face of the 
balance sheet as components of other assets and liabilities.

1  Amounts in the table refer to deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and tax credits for federal income tax purposes 

Deferred tax assets were not recognized on these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized. 

As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Group recognized deferred tax assets of € 6.0 billion and € 2.5 billion, 
respectively, that exceeded deferred tax liabilities in entities which have suffered a tax loss in either the current or preceding 
period. This is based on management’s assessment that it is probable that the respective entities will have taxable profits 
against which the unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized. In determining 
the amounts of deferred tax assets to be recognized, management uses historical profitability information and, if relevant, 
forecasted operating results, based upon approved business plans, including a review of the eligible carry-forward periods, 
tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.  

As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Group had temporary differences associated with the Group’s parent 
company’s  investments  in  subsidiaries,  branches  and  associates  and  interests  in  joint  ventures  of  € 349 million  and 
€ 244 million respectively, in respect of which no deferred tax liabilities were recognized.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 

Derivative contracts used by the Group include swaps, futures, forwards, options and other similar types of contracts. In the 
normal  course  of  business,  the  Group  enters  into  a  variety  of  derivative  transactions  for  sales,  market-making  and  risk 
management  purposes.  The  Group’s  objectives  in  using  derivative  instruments  are  to  meet  customers’  risk  management 
needs and to manage the Group’s exposure to risks.  

In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy relating to derivatives and hedge accounting as described in Note 1 “Material 
Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates”, all derivatives are carried at fair value in the balance sheet regardless 
of whether they are held for trading or non-trading purposes. 

Derivatives held for sales and market-making purposes 

Sales and market-making 

The majority of the Group’s derivatives transactions relate to sales and market-making activities. Sales activities include the 
structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or 
expected  risks.  Market-making  involves  quoting  bid  and  offer  prices  to  other  market  participants,  enabling  revenue  to  be 
generated based on spreads and volume.  

Risk management 

The Group uses derivatives in order to reduce its exposure to market risks as part of its asset and liability management. This 
is  achieved  by  entering  into  derivatives  that  hedge  specific  portfolios  of  fixed  rate  financial  instruments  and  forecast 
transactions as well as strategic hedging against overall balance sheet exposures. The Group actively manages interest rate 
risk through, among other things, the use of derivative contracts. Utilization of derivative financial instruments is modified from 
time to time within prescribed limits in response to changing market conditions, as well as to changes in the characteristics 
and mix of the related assets and liabilities. 

Derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting 

The Group applies hedge accounting if derivatives meet the specific criteria described in Note 1 “Material Accounting Policies 
and Critical Accounting Estimates”. 

In fair value hedge relationship, the Group uses primarily interest rate swaps and options, in order to protect itself against 
movements in the fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates. In a cash flow hedge 
relationship, the Group uses interest rate swaps in order to protect itself against exposure to variability in interest rates. The 
Group enters into foreign exchange forwards and swaps for hedges of translation adjustments resulting from translating the 
financial statements of net investments in foreign operations into the reporting currency of the parent at period end spot rates. 

Interest rate risk 

The  Group  uses  interest  rate  swaps  and  options  to  manage  its  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  by  modifying  the  re-pricing 
characteristics of existing and/or forecasted assets and liabilities, including funding and investment activities. The interest rate 
swaps and options are designated in either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. For fair value hedges, the Group uses 
interest  rate  swaps  and  options  contracts  to  manage  the  fair  value  movements  of  fixed  rate  financial  instruments  due  to 
changes  in  benchmark  interest.  For  cash  flow  hedges,  we  use  interest  rate  swaps  to  manage  the  exposure  to  cash  flow 
variability of our variable rate instruments as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates. 

The  Group  manages  its  interest  rate  risk  exposure  on  a  portfolio  basis  with  frequent  changes  in  the  portfolio  due  to  the 
origination of new loans and bonds, repayments of existing loans and bonds, issuance of new funding liabilities and repayment 
of  existing  funding  liabilities.  Accordingly,  a  dynamic  hedging  accounting  approach  is  adopted  for  the  portfolio,  in  which 
individual hedge relationships are designated and de-designated on a more frequent basis (e.g. on a monthly basis).

Additional Notes 
35 – Derivatives 

The Group assesses and measures hedge effectiveness of a hedging relationship based on the change in the fair value or 
cash  flows  of  the  derivative  hedging  instrument  relative  to  the  change  in  the  fair  value  or  cash  flows  of  the  hedged  item 
attributable  to  the  hedged  risk.  Potential  sources  of  ineffectiveness  can  be  attributed  to  differences  between  hedging 
instruments and hedged items: 

–  Mismatches in the terms of hedged items and hedging instruments, for example the frequency and timing of when interest 

rates are reset, frequency of payment and callable features. 

–  Difference  in  the  discounting  rate  applied  to  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument,  taking  into  consideration 

differences in the reset frequency of the hedged item and hedging instrument. 

–  Derivatives used as hedging instrument with a non-zero fair value at inception date of the hedging relationship, resulting in 

mismatch in terms with the hedged item. 

The  Group’s  portfolio  fair  value  hedging  relationships  include  hedges  of  well-collateralized  German  fixed  rate  mortgages 
portfolios where the Group maintains headroom to avoid any hedge ineffectiveness that may arise from an increase in the 
default risk of the underlying mortgage portfolio. This also applies to the Group’s portfolio fair value hedge relationships that 
include non-maturing deposits that the Group’s customers may withdraw on demand. The stable nature of the Group’s deposit 
volume (refer to Note 26) as well as a headroom means that Group has not observed any hedge ineffectiveness from the 
hedge accounting application. In the current year, the Group partly discontinued its macro cash flow program that includes a 
portfolio of corporate variable yielding loans as hedged item. This discontinuation was triggered by a rebalancing of the Group’s 
hedge accounting designations and the Group has not recorded any hedge ineffectiveness due to an increase in counterparty 
defaults or unexpected pre-payments in the corporate loan portfolio. 

Foreign exchange risk 

The Group manages its foreign currency risk (including U.S. dollar and British pound) from investments in foreign operation 
through net investment hedges using rolling foreign exchange forward strategy. In addition, the Group applies cash flow hedge 
accounting  for  specific  foreign  denominated  highly  probable  cash  flows  using  foreign  exchange  forward  instruments  as 
hedging instruments.  

As  the  investments  in  foreign  operations  are  only  hedged  to  the  extent  of  the  notional  amount  of  the  hedging  derivative 
instrument the Group generally does not expect to incur significant ineffectiveness on hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations.  Potential  sources  of  ineffectiveness  are  limited  to  situations  where  derivatives  with  a  non-zero  fair  value  at 
inception date of the hedging relationship are used as hedging instrument, or where the spot foreign currency risk has been 
designated as hedged risk, resulting in mismatch in terms with the hedged item. Similarly, for cash flow hedge accounting 
applications  the  foreign  exchange  forward  instruments  generally  match  the  terms  of  the  underlying  highly  probable 
transactions such that the Group does not expect to incur significant ineffectiveness in such hedge relationships. 

Hedge Accounting and Interest Rate Benchmarks 

The table below shows the Group’s hedge accounting relationships impacted by the IASB Benchmark Reform amendments, 
the significant interest rate benchmarks the Group is exposed to which are subject to expected future reform, and the nominal 
amounts of the derivative hedging instruments as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. As at December 31, 2023 
and as at December 31, 2022, there were no hedge relationships with hedging instruments, hedged items or the hedged risk 
being  an  IBOR benchmark  which  ceased  to  be  quoted  in  early  2022. The  derivative  hedging  instruments provide  a  close 
approximation to the extent of the risk exposure the Group manages through hedge accounting relationships.

Additional Notes 
35 – Derivatives 

In accordance with IAS 39.96 the gains and losses posted to equity in a cash flow hedge relationship is the lesser of cumulative 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument from the inception of the hedge and the cumulative change in fair value of the expected 
future cash flows on the hedged item from inception of the hedge. As a result, changes of the hedged item’s value used for 
hedge effectiveness are not fully recorded in equity if it exceeds the hedging instrument’s fair value changes used for hedge 
effectiveness. Consequently, hedge ineffectiveness recorded within P&L does not always reconcile to the difference between 
the changes of the hedged item’s value used for hedge effectiveness and the hedging instrument’s fair value changes used 
for hedge effectiveness. 

As of December 31, 2023 the longest term cash flow hedge matures in 2035. 

The  financial  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  are  recognized  as  Loans  at  amortized  cost  in  the  Group’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Group uses a foreign exchange forward strategy. As indicated in the above table, the vast majority of forward contracts 
mature within the year. The Group did not calculate an average foreign currency rate because the amount of contracts that 
mature after 1 year are not material.

Significant restrictions to access or use the Group’s assets 

Statutory, contractual or regulatory requirements as well as protective rights of noncontrolling interests might restrict the ability 
of the Group to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group.  

The following contractual restrictions impact the Group’s ability to use assets and the table below reflects the volume of those 
restricted assets: 

–  The  Group  has  pledged  assets  to  collateralize  its  obligations  under  repurchase  agreements,  securities  financing 

transactions, collateralized loan obligations and for margining purposes for OTC derivative liabilities 

–  The assets of consolidated structured entities are held for the benefit of the parties that have bought the notes issued by 

these entities

In addition to the above and in line with the regulation on Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) (Commission Delegated Regulation 
(EU) 2015/61), the Group identifies if assets held in third country are subject to restrictions to their free transferability. The 
Group, identifies the volume of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in excess of net cash outflows held in the third countries 
which are not freely transferable and excludes them from the HQLA. The aggregated amount of such HQLA that are held at 
entities in third countries and considered restricted is € 13.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 (€ 21.8 billion as of December 31, 
2022). During 2023, the Group has transitioned its risk appetite from liquidity reserves to HQLA.

Nature, purpose and extent of the Group’s interests in structured entities 

The Group engages in various business activities with structured entities which are designed to achieve a specific business 
purpose. A structured entity is one that has been set up so that any voting rights or similar rights are not the dominant factor 
in  deciding  who  controls  the  entity.  An  example  is  when  voting  rights  relate  only  to  administrative  tasks  and  the  relevant 
activities are directed by contractual arrangements. 

A structured entity often has some or all of the following features or attributes: 

–  Restricted activities 
–  A narrow and well-defined objective 
–  Insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support 
–  Financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other 

risks (tranches) 

The principal uses of structured entities are to provide clients with access to specific portfolios of assets and to provide market 
liquidity  for  clients  through  securitizing  financial  assets.  Structured  entities  may  be  established  as  corporations,  trusts  or 
partnerships.  Structured  entities  generally  finance  the  purchase  of  assets  by  issuing  debt  and  equity  securities  that  are 
collateralized  by  and/or  indexed  to  the  assets  held  by  the  structured  entities.  The  debt  and  equity  securities  issued  by 
structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of subordination. 

Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entities 
indicate that the structured entities are controlled by the Group, as discussed in Note 1 “Material Accounting Policies and 
Critical Accounting Estimates”.  

Consolidated structured entities 

The  Group  has  contractual  arrangements  which  may  require  it  to  provide  financial  support  to  the  following  types  of 
consolidated structured entities. 

Securitization vehicles  
The Group uses securitization vehicles for funding purchase of diversified pool of assets. The Group provides financial support 
to these entities in the form of liquidity facility. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding 
loan commitments to these entities. 

Funds  
The Group may provide funding and liquidity facility or guarantees to funds consolidated by the group. As of December 31, 
2023 and December 31, 2022, the notional value of the liquidity facilities and guarantees provided by the Group to such funds 
was € 1.1 billion and € 1.1 billion, respectively. 

Deutsche Bank did not provide non-contractual support during the year to consolidated structured entities. 

Unconsolidated structured entities 

These are entities which are not consolidated because the Group does not control them through voting rights, contract, funding 
agreements, or other means. The extent of the Group’s interests to unconsolidated structured entities will vary depending on 
the type of structured entities. 

Below is a description of the Group’s involvements in unconsolidated structured entities by type. 

Repackaging and investment entities 
Repackaging and investment entities are established to meet clients’ investment needs through the combination of securities 
and derivatives. These entities are not consolidated by the Group because the Group does not have power to influence the 
returns obtained from the entities. These entities are usually set up to provide a certain investment return pre-agreed with the 
investor, and the Group is not able to change the investment strategy or return during the life of the transaction.

Annual Report 2023 

Additional Notes 
38 – Structured entities 

Third party funding entities 
The Group provides funding to structured entities that hold a variety of assets. These entities may take the form of funding 
entities, trusts and private investment companies. The funding is collateralized by the asset in the structured entities. The 
group’s involvement involves predominantly both lending and loan commitments. 

The vehicles used in these transactions are controlled by the borrowers where the borrowers have the ability to decide whether 
to post additional margin or collateral in respect of the financing. In such cases, where borrowers can decide to continue or 
terminate the financing, the borrowers will consolidate the vehicle. 

Securitization Vehicles 
The Group establishes securitization vehicles which purchase diversified pools of assets, including fixed income securities, 
corporate  loans,  and  asset-backed  securities  (predominantly  commercial  and  residential  mortgage-backed  securities  and 
credit card receivables). The vehicles fund these purchases by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities, the 
repayment of which is linked to the performance of the assets in the vehicles.  

The Group may transfer assets to these securitization vehicles and provides financial support to these entities in the form of 
liquidity facilities. The Group also invests and provides liquidity facilities to third party sponsored securitization vehicles. The 
securitization vehicles that are not consolidated into the Group are those where the Group does not hold the power or ability 
to unilaterally remove the servicer or special servicer who has been delegated power over the activities of the entity. 

Funds 
The Group establishes structured entities to accommodate client requirements to hold investments in specific assets. The 
Group also invests in funds that are sponsored by third parties or the bank may act as fund manager, custodian or some other 
capacity and provide funding and liquidity facilities to both bank sponsored and third party  funds. The funding provided is 
collateralized by the underlying assets held by the fund. 

The Group does not consolidate funds when Deutsche Bank is deemed agent or when another third party investor has the 
ability to direct the activities of the fund. 

Other 
These are Deutsche Bank sponsored or third party structured entities that do not fall into any criteria above. These entities 
are not consolidated by the Group when the bank does not hold power over the decision making of these entities. 

Income derived from involvement with structured entities 
The Group earns management fees and, occasionally, performance-based fees for its investment management service in 
relation to funds. Interest income is recognized on the funding provided to structured entities. Any trading revenue as a result 
of derivatives with structured entities and from the movements in the value of notes held in these entities is recognized in ‘Net 
gains/losses on financial assets/liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss. 

Interests in unconsolidated structured entities 
The Group’s interests in unconsolidated structured entities refer to contractual and non-contractual involvement that exposes 
the  bank  to  variability  of  returns  from  the  performance  of  the  structured  entities.  Examples  of  interests  in  unconsolidated 
structured entities include debt or equity investments, liquidity facilities, guarantees and certain derivative instruments in which 
the Group is absorbing variability of returns from the structured entities. 

Interests in unconsolidated structured entities exclude instruments which introduce variability of returns into the structured 
entities. For example, when the bank purchases credit protection from an unconsolidated structured entity whose purpose and 
design  is  to  pass  through  credit  risk  to  investors,  the  bank  is  providing  the  variability  of  returns  to  the  entity  rather  than 
absorbing variability. The purchased credit protection is therefore not considered as an interest for the purpose of the table 
below. 

Maximum exposure to unconsolidated structured entities 
The maximum exposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the unconsolidated structured entity. 
The maximum exposure for loans and trading instruments is reflected by their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance 
sheet. The maximum exposure for derivatives and off-balance sheet commitments such as guarantees, liquidity facilities and 
loan commitments under IFRS 12, as interpreted by Deutsche Bank, is reflected by the notional amounts. Such amounts or 
its development do not reflect the economic risks faced by the Group because it does not take into account the effects of 
collateral  or  hedges,  nor  the  probability  of  such  losses  being  incurred.  At  December 31,  2023,  the  notional  related  to  the 
positive and negative replacement values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were € 117 billion, € 315 billion 
and € 26 billion respectively. At December 31, 2022, the notional related to the positive and negative replacement values of 
derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were € 457 billion, € 397 billion and € 28 billion respectively.

Size of structured entities 

The Group provides a different measure for size of structured entities depending on their type. The following measures have 
been considered as appropriate indicators for evaluating the size of structured entities: 

–  Funds – Net asset value or assets under management where the bank holds fund units and notional of derivatives when 

the bank’s interest comprises of derivatives 

–  Securitizations – notional of notes in issue (excluding interest only and excess notes where applicable) when the Group 
derives its interests through notes its holds and notional of derivatives when the bank’s interests is in the form of derivatives 

–  Third party funding entities –Total assets in entities  
–  Repackaging and investment entities – Fair value of notes in issue 

For third party funding entities, size information is not publicly available, therefore the Group has disclosed the greater of the 
collateral received/pledged or the notional of the exposure the bank has to the entity.  

Based on the above definitions, the total size of structured entities is € 2,329 billion, of which the majority of € 1,223 billion is 
from Funds. In 2022, it was € 2,723 billion and € 1,138 billion respectively. 

The  following  table  shows,  by  type  of  structured  entity,  the  carrying  amounts  of  the  Group’s  interests  recognized  in  the 
consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  as  well  as  the  maximum  exposure  to  loss  resulting  from  these  interests.  The 
carrying amounts presented below do not reflect the true variability of returns faced by the Group because they do not take 
into account the effects of collateral or hedges.

Total trading assets as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 of € 8.9 billion and € 9.9 billion are comprised primarily 
of € 2.8 billion and € 3.2 billion in securitizations and € 3.3 billion and € 3.7 billion in funds structured entities respectively. The 
Group’s interests in securitizations are collateralized by the assets contained in these entities. Where the Group holds fund 
units these are typically in regard to market making in funds or otherwise serve as hedges for notes issued to clients. Moreover, 
the credit risk arising from loans made to third party funding structured entities is mitigated by the collateral received.  

Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss includes reverse repurchase agreements to funds 
which comprise the majority of the interests in this category and are collateralized by the underlying securities.  

Loans  as  of  December 31,  2023,  and  December 31,  2022,  consist  of  € 116.7 billion  and  € 118.6 billion  investment  in 
securitization  tranches  and  financing  to  third  party  funding  entities. The  Group’s  financing  to  third  party  funding  entities  is 
collateralized by the assets in those structured entities.  

Other  assets  as  of  December 31,  2023,  and  December 31,  2022,  of  € 14.7 billion  and  € 14.7 billion,  respectively,  consist 
primarily of cash margin balances. 

Pending Receivable balances are not included in this disclosure note due to the fact that these balances arise from typical 
customer supplier relationships out of e.g., brokerage type activities and their inherent volatility would not provide users of the 
financial statements with effective information about Deutsche Bank’s exposures to structured entities. 

Financial support 

Deutsche Bank did not provide non-contractual support during the year to unconsolidated structured entities.

Additional Notes 
39 – Current and non-current assets and liabilities 

Sponsored unconsolidated structured entities where the Group has no interest as 
of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. 

As a sponsor, Deutsche Bank is involved in the legal set up and marketing of the entity and supports the entity in different 
ways, namely: 

–  Transferring assets to the entities 
–  Providing seed capital to the entities 
–  Providing operational support to ensure the entity’s continued operation 
–  Providing guarantees of performance to the structured entities. 

The bank is also deemed a sponsor for a structured entity if market participants would reasonably associate the entity with 
Deutsche Bank. Additionally, the use of the Deutsche Bank name for the structured entity indicates that the bank has acted 
as a sponsor.  

The  gross  revenues  from  sponsored  entities  where  the  bank  did  not  hold  an  interest  as  of  December 31, 2023,  and 
December 31, 2022, were € 38 million and € 226 million respectively. Instances where the bank does not hold an interest in 
an unconsolidated sponsored structured entity include cases where any seed capital or funding to the structured entity has 
already been repaid in full to the Group during the year. This amount does not take into account the impacts of hedges and is 
recognized  in  Net  gains/losses  on  financial  assets/liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  and  loss.  The  aggregated  carrying 
amounts of assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities in 2023 were € 1.7 billion for securitization and 
€ 1.9 billion  for  repackaging  and  investment  entities.  In  2022,  they  were  € 3.4 billion  for  securitization  and  € 1.2 billion  for 
repackaging and investment entities.

Annual Report 2023

41 – Regulatory capital information  

General definitions  

The  calculation  of  Deutsche  Bank’s  own  funds  incorporates  the  capital  requirements  following  the  “Regulation  (EU)  No 
575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions” CRR and the “Directive 2013/36/EU on access to the activity of 
credit  institutions  and  the  prudential  supervision  of  credit  institutions”  “CRD”,  which  have  been  further  amended  with 
subsequent Regulations and Directives. The CRD has been implemented into German law. The information in this section as 
well as in the section “Development of risk-weighted assets” is based on the regulatory principles of consolidation. 

This section refers to the capital adequacy of the group of entities consolidated for banking regulatory purposes pursuant to 
the CRR and the German Banking Act (“Kreditwesengesetz” or “KWG”). Therein not included are insurance companies or 
companies outside the finance sector.  

The total own funds pursuant to the effective regulations as of year-end 2023 comprises Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital 
is subdivided into Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital. 

CET 1 capital consists primarily of common share capital (net of own holdings) including related share premium accounts, 
retained earnings (including losses for the financial year, if any) and accumulated other comprehensive income, subject to 
regulatory  adjustments  (i.e.,  prudential  filters  and  deductions),  as  well  as  minority  interests  qualifying  for  inclusion  in 
consolidated CET 1 capital. Prudential filters for CET 1 capital, according to Articles 32 to 35 CRR, include securitization gains 
on  sale,  cash  flow  hedges  and  changes  in  the  value  of  own  liabilities,  and  additional  value  adjustments.  CET  1  capital 
deductions for instance includes intangible assets (exceeding their prudential value), deferred tax assets that rely on future 
profitability, negative amounts resulting from the calculation of expected loss amounts, net defined benefit pension fund assets, 
reciprocal cross holdings in the capital of financial sector entities and, significant and non-significant investments in the capital 
(CET 1, AT1, Tier 2) of financial sector entities above certain thresholds. All items which are not deducted (i.e., amounts below 
the threshold) are subject to risk-weighting.  

Additional Tier 1 capital consists of AT1 capital instruments and related share premium accounts as well as noncontrolling 
interests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated AT1 capital. To qualify as AT1 capital under CRR/CRD, instruments must 
have principal loss absorption through a conversion to common shares or a write-down mechanism allocating losses at a 
trigger point and must also meet further requirements such as perpetual with no incentive to redeem, institution must have full 
dividend/coupon discretion at all times, etc. 

Tier 2 capital comprises eligible capital instruments, the related share premium accounts and subordinated long-term debt, 
certain loan loss provisions and noncontrolling interests that qualify for inclusion in consolidated Tier 2 capital. To qualify as 
Tier 2 capital, capital instruments or subordinated debt must have an original maturity of at least five years. Moreover, eligible 
capital instruments may inter alia not contain an incentive to redeem, a right of investors to accelerate repayment, or a credit 
sensitive dividend feature. 

Capital instruments  

The Management Board was authorized by the 2022 Annual General Meeting to buy, on or before April 30, 2027, shares of 
up to 10% of the share capital at the time this resolution was taken or, if lower, of the share capital at the respective time the 
authorization was exercised. As at the 2022 Annual General Meeting, this corresponded to a volume of up to 206.6 million 
shares. Thereof, a volume of up to 5% of the total share capital or 103.3 million shares can be purchased by using derivatives, 
including derivatives with a volume of up to 2% of the total share capital with a maturity exceeding 18 months. During the 
period from the 2022 Annual General Meeting until the 2023 Annual General Meeting, 36.3 million shares were purchased for 
equity  compensation  purposes  in  the  same  period  or  upcoming  periods.  Thereof,  22.7 million  shares  were  purchased  by 
exercising  call  options.  In  addition,  30.2 million  new  call  options  were  purchased  for  equity  compensation  purposes  in 
upcoming periods. The number of shares held in Treasury amounted to 5.0 million as of the 2023 Annual General Meeting. 
These shares were held for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods.

41 – Regulatory capital information 

The Annual General Meeting on May 17, 2023 granted the Management Board the approval to buy, on or before April 30, 
2028, shares of up to 10% of the share capital at the time of this resolution was taken or, if lower, of the share capital at the 
respective time the authorization was exercised. As at the 2023 Annual General Meeting, this corresponded to 204 million 
shares. Thereof, a volume of up to 5% of the total share capital or 102 million shares can be purchased by using derivatives, 
including  derivatives  with  a  volume  of  up  to  2%  of  the  total  share  capital  with  a  maturity  exceeding  18  months.  These 
authorizations replaced the authorizations of the previous year. During the period from the 2023 Annual General Meeting until 
December  31,  2023,  45.5 million  shares  were  purchased  for  cancellation  with  the  purpose  of  distributing  capital  to 
shareholders. The number of shares held in Treasury from buybacks amounted to 48.2 million as of December 31, 2023. 
Thereof 45.5 million relate to shares bought back for cancellation. The remaining amount of 2.7 million shares relates to shares 
to be used for equity compensation purposes in upcoming periods.  

Since  the  2017  Annual  General  Meeting,  renewed  at  the  2021  Annual  General  Meeting,  and  as  of  December  31,  2023, 
authorized capital available to the Management Board is € 2,560 million (1,000 million shares).  

Since the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the Management Board is authorized to issue participatory notes and other hybrid 
debt  securities  that  fulfill  the  regulatory  requirements  to  qualify  as  Additional  Tier  1  capital  with  an  equivalent  value  of 
€ 9.0 billion  on  or  before  April  30,  2027.  Deutsche  Bank  issued  € 1.25 billion  new  AT1  notes  under  this  authorization  in 
November 2022. 

The current CRR as applicable since June 27, 2019, provides further grandfathering rules for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments 
issued prior to June 27, 2019. AT1 and Tier 2 instruments issued through special purpose entities were grandfathered until 
December 31, 2021. In 2023, transitional arrangements only exist for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments which continue to qualify 
until June 26, 2025, even if they do not meet certain new requirements that apply since June 27, 2019. Deutsche Bank had 
an immaterial amount of instruments that qualified during 2023, which resulted in no material difference between the “fully 
loaded” and “transitional” amounts.  

Based on the current CRR, the Group has eligible AT1 instruments of € 8.6 billion outstanding as of December 2023. In 2023, 
the bank did not issue or redeem AT1 notes. 

As of December 31, 2023, Tier 2 capital instruments amounted to € 8.6 billion (nominal value of € 11.5 billion). In 2023, the 
bank issued Tier 2 capital instruments with a nominal value U.S. $ 1.5 billion (equivalent amount of € 1.4 billion) and a notional 
of € 132.5 million Tier 2 capital instruments matured. 

Minimum capital requirements and additional capital buffers  

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in supervisory measures such as restrictions of profit distributions or 
limitations on certain businesses such as lending. Deutsche Bank complied with the minimum regulatory capital adequacy 
requirements in 2023.

Capital management 

Deutsche Bank’s Treasury function manages solvency, capital adequacy, leverage, and bail-in capacity ratios at Group level 
and locally in each region, as applicable. Treasury implements Deutsche Bank’s capital strategy, which itself is developed by 
the  Group  Risk  Committee  and  approved  by  the  Management  Board.  Treasury,  directly  or  through  the  Group  Asset  and 
Liability Committee, manages, among other things, issuance and repurchase of shares and capital instruments, hedging of 
capital ratios against foreign exchange swings, setting capacities for key financial resources, the design of shareholders’ equity 
allocation, and regional capital planning. The bank is fully committed to maintaining Deutsche Bank’s sound capitalization both 
from an economic and regulatory perspective considering both book equity based on IFRS accounting standards, regulatory 
and  economic  capital  as  well  as  specific  capital  requirements  from  rating  agencies.  The  bank  continuously  monitors  and 
adjusts Deutsche Bank’s overall capital demand and supply to always achieve an appropriate balance. 

Treasury manages the issuance and repurchase of capital instruments, namely Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 capital instruments as well as TLAC/MREL eligible debt instruments. Treasury constantly monitors the market for liability 
management trades. Such trades represent a countercyclical opportunity to create Common Equity Tier 1 capital by buying 
back Deutsche Bank’s issuances below par. 

Treasury manages the sensitivity of Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 ratio and capital towards swings in foreign currency exchange 
rates against the euro. For this purpose, Treasury develops and executes suitable hedging strategies within the constraints of 
a Management Board approved Risk Appetite. Capital invested into Deutsche Bank’s foreign subsidiaries and branches is 
either not hedged, partially hedged or fully hedged. Thereby, Treasury aims to balance effects from foreign exchange rate 
movements  on  capital,  capital  deduction  items  and  risk  weighted  assets  in  foreign  currency.  In  addition,  Treasury  also 
accounts for associated hedge cost and implications on market risk weighted assets.

Resource limit setting 

Resource limit setting 

Usage of key financial resources is influenced through the following governance processes and incentives.  

Target resource capacities are reviewed in Deutsche Bank’s annual strategic plan in line with Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 and 
Leverage Ratio ambitions. As a part of Deutsche Bank’s quarterly process, the Group Asset and Liability Committee approves 
divisional  resource  limits  for  total  capital  demand  (defined  as  the  sum  of  RWA  and  certain  RWA  equivalents  of  Capital 
Deduction Items and certain RWA equivalents of Capital Buffer Requirements items) and leverage exposure that are based 
on  the  strategic  plan  but  adjusted  for  market  conditions  and  the  short-term  outlook.  Limits  are  enforced  through  a  close 
monitoring process and an excess charging mechanism. 

Overall regulatory capital requirements are principally driven by either Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 ratio (solvency) or leverage 
ratio  (leverage)  requirements,  whichever  is  the  more  binding  constraint.  For  the  internal  capital  allocation,  the  combined 
contribution of each segment to the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, the Group’s Leverage ratio and the Group’s Capital 
Loss under Stress are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint to the Group. Contributions to the 
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the Leverage ratio are measured through RWA and Leverage Ratio Exposure (LRE). The 
Group’s Capital Loss under Stress is a measure of the Group’s overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. 
Goodwill, other intangible assets, and business-related regulatory capital deduction items included in total capital demand are 
directly allocated to the respective segments, supporting the calculation of the allocated tangible shareholders equity and the 
respective rate of return.  

Most of Deutsche Bank’s subsidiaries and several of Deutsche Bank’s branches are subject to legal and regulatory capital 
requirements. In developing, implementing, and testing Deutsche Bank’s capital and liquidity position, the bank fully takes 
such  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  into  account.  Any  material  capital  requests  of  Deutsche  Bank’s  branches  and 
subsidiaries across the globe are presented to and approved by the Group Investment Committee prior to execution. 

Further, Treasury is a member of Deutsche Bank’s Pensions Committee and represented in relevant Investment Committees 
overseeing  the  management  of  the  assets  of  the  largest  Deutsche  Bank  pension  funds  in  Germany.  These  investment 
committees set the investment strategy for these funds in line with the bank’s investment objective to protect the capital base 
and distribution capacity of the bank.

§ 26a KWG requires annual disclosure of certain information by geographic location. The information disclosed in the table 
below is derived from the IFRS Group accounts of Deutsche Bank. The table is however not reconcilable to other financial 
information in this report because of specific requirements published by Bundesbank on December 16, 2014 which include 
the requirement to present the information on geographic locations prior to elimination of cross-border intra-group transactions. 
In  line  with  these  Bundesbank  requirements,  intra-group  transactions  within  the  same  geographic  location  are  eliminated. 
These eliminations are identical to the eliminations applied for internal management reporting on the respective geographical 
locations. 

The  geographic  location  of  subsidiaries  and  branches  considers  the  location  of  incorporation  or  residence  as  well  as  the 
relevant tax jurisdiction. For the names, nature of activity and domicile of subsidiaries and branches, please refer to Note 44

On June 30, 2023, Deutsche Bank materially completed the transition of its remaining transactions linked to USD LIBOR rates. 
All positions previously referencing CHF LIBOR, JPY LIBOR, EUR LIBOR and EONIA were transitioned in 2022. Positions 
referencing GBP LIBOR and USD LIBOR tenors that ceased in early 2022 have been materially transitioned to an alternative 
reference rate. 

The bank panel to determine the USD LIBOR permanently ceased as of June 30, 2023, but certain short-term US dollar LIBOR 
settings  will  continue  to  be  published  using  a  synthetic  methodology  until  September  30,  2024.  Remaining  USD  LIBOR 
exposure  post  cessation  relate  to  positions  temporarily utilizing  the  last  available  LIBOR  fixing  or synthetic LIBOR. These 
positions  are  closely  monitored  and  are  on  track  for  transition.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  Deutsche  Bank’s  financial 
instruments notional exposure linked to synthetic USD LIBOR settings is € 3.6 billion, thereof Derivatives: € 0.1 billion, Non-
Derivative financial assets: € 1.1 billion, Non-Derivative financial liabilities: € 2.4 billion. As of December 31, 2022, notional 
exposure  of  positions  referencing  USD  LIBOR  was:  € 5,975 billion,  thereof  Derivatives:  € 5,897 billion,  Non-Derivative 
financial assets: € 34 billion, Non-Derivative financial liabilities: € 9 billion and Off-balance sheet commitments: € 35 billion.

To Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main 

Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group 
management report 

Opinions 

We  have  audited  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Deutsche  Bank  Aktiengesellschaft,  Frankfurt  am  Main,  and  its 
subsidiaries  (the  group),  which  comprise  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  at  31 December  2023,  and  the  consolidated 
statement  of  income,  consolidated  statement  of  comprehensive  income,  consolidated  statement  of  changes  in  equity  and 
consolidated  statement  of  cash  flows  for  the  fiscal  year  from  1 January  2023  to  31 December  2023,  and  notes  to  the 
consolidated financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group 
management report of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, which is combined with the management report 
of the Bank, for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, 
we  have  not  audited  the  last  paragraph  of  the  section  “Risk  management  principles  (chapter  risk  report)”  of  the  group 
management report regarding management’s statement on the risk management framework and internal control system and 
the content of the combined “Corporate Governance Statement pursuant to Sec. 289f and 315d HGB” which is published on 
the website stated in the group management report and is part of the group management report. 

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, 

–  the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, 
and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these 
requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the group as at 31 December 2023 
and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, and 

–  the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group’s position. In all material 
respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German 
legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. We do not express an 
opinion on the last paragraph of the section risk management principles (chapter “risk report”) of the group management 
report regarding management’s statement on the risk management framework and internal control system referred to above 
or the content of the combined statement on corporate governance referred to above.  

Pursuant  to  Sec. 322 (3)  Sentence 1  HGB,  we  declare  that  our  audit  has  not  led  to  any  reservations  relating  to  the  legal 
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. 

Basis for the opinions  

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with 
Sec. 317  HGB  and  the  EU  Audit  Regulation  (No  537/2014,  referred  to  subsequently  as  "EU  Audit  Regulation")  and  in 
compliance  with  German  Generally  Accepted  Standards  for  Financial  Statement  Audits  promulgated  by  the  Institut  der 
Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles 
are further described in the "Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group 
management  report"  section  of  our  auditor’s  report.  We  are  independent  of  the  group  entities  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements  of  European  law  and  German  commercial  and  professional  law,  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other  German 
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with  Art. 10 (2) f) of the EU 
Audit  Regulation,  we  declare  that  we  have  not  provided  non-audit  services  prohibited  under  Art. 5 (1)  of  the  EU  Audit 
Regulation.  We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have  obtained  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our 
opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements  

Key  audit  matters  are  those  matters  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the 
consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  fiscal  year  from  1 January  2023  to  31 December  2023.  These  matters  were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 

Below, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters: 

1.  Valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in 

active markets 

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter 

Management uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted 
in active markets. The Group held level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value of EUR 25,599 million 
and EUR 10,856 million as of 31 December 2023. The relevant financial instruments are reported within financial assets and 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.  

Financial  instruments  and  related  inputs  that  are  not  quoted  in  active  markets  include  structured  derivatives  valued  using 
complex models; more-complex or illiquid OTC derivatives; distressed debt; highly-structured bonds; illiquid loans, including 
those relating to commercial real estate; credit spreads used to determine valuation adjustments; and other significant inputs 
which cannot be observed for financial instruments with longer-dated maturities. 

As the valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in active markets is based to a high degree on 
management’s assumptions and judgments due to the complex nature of the valuation techniques and models being utilized 
and the unobservability of the significant inputs used, this is a key audit matter. 

Auditor’s response 

We  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  the  controls  over 
management’s processes to determine fair value of financial instruments and determination of significant unobservable inputs 
therein. This includes controls relating to independent price verification; independent validation of valuation models, including 
assessment of model limitations; monitoring of valuation model usage; and calculation of fair value adjustments. 

We evaluated the valuation techniques, models and methodologies, and tested the significant inputs used in those models. 
We performed an independent revaluation of a sample of derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value that are not 
quoted in active markets, using independent models and inputs. We also independently assessed the reasonableness of a 
sample  of  proxy  inputs  used  by  comparing  to  market  data  sources  and  evaluated  their  relevance  to  the  related  financial 
instruments.  

In addition, we evaluated the methodology and inputs used by management in determining fair value adjustments against the 
requirements of IFRS 13 and performed recalculations for a sample of these valuation adjustments using our own independent 
data and methodology.  

We involved internal financial instruments valuation specialists in the procedures related to valuation models, independent 
revaluation and fair value adjustments.  

Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not 
quoted in active markets. 

Reference to related disclosures 

Information  on  the  valuation  techniques,  models  and  methodologies  used  in  the  measurement  of  fair  value  is  provided  in 
notes 1 and 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

2.  Inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of 

expected credit losses  

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter 

As of 31 December 2023, the Group recognized an allowance for credit losses of EUR 5,726 million, with EUR 1,358 million 
relating to stage 1 and stage 2 allowances. 

The estimated probabilities of default (PD) used in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses on non-defaulted 
financial  instruments  (IFRS 9  stage 1  and  stage 2)  are  based  on  historical  information,  combined  with  current  economic 
developments  and  forward-looking  macroeconomic  forecasts  (e.g.,  gross  domestic  product  and  unemployment  rates). 
Statistical techniques are used to transform the base scenario for future macroeconomic developments into multiple scenarios. 
These scenarios are the basis for deriving multi-year PD curves for different rating and counterparty classes, which are used 
in the calculation of expected credit losses. 

Given the economic uncertainties regarding pronounced movements in interest rates, current geopolitical conflicts and other 
sources  of  volatility  impacting  macroeconomic  variables,  the  estimation  of  forward-looking  information  requires  significant 
judgment. To reflect these uncertainties, management must assess whether to make adjustments to its standard process for 
inclusion of macroeconomic variables into the expected credit loss model and forecasting methods, either by adjusting the 
macroeconomic variables or through the inclusion of management overlays. 

In view of the significant holdings of non-defaulted financial instruments subject to impairment under IFRS 9 and the economic 
uncertainty  and  significant  use  of  judgment,  we  consider  the  inclusion  of  forward-looking  information  in  the  model-based 
calculation of expected credit losses, and any adjustments thereof, to be a key audit matter. 

Auditor’s response 

We obtained an understanding of the processes implemented by management, assessed the design of the controls over the 
selection, determination, monitoring and validation of forward-looking information in respect of the requirements under IFRS 9, 
and tested their operating effectiveness. 

We evaluated management’s review of its expected credit loss model and forecasting methods conducted through the model 
validation process. Furthermore, we evaluated the methods used to include the selected variables in the baseline scenario 
and the derivation of the multiple scenarios. 

We assessed the baseline macroeconomic forecasts by comparing them with macroeconomic forecasts published by external 
sources. 

We also evaluated the methodology applied by management to determine whether to adjust its standard process for inclusion 
of macroeconomic variables or to adjust the model results through management overlays. In doing so, we assessed the results 
of management’s sensitivity analysis and compared the macroeconomic variables used to our own benchmark analysis. We 
also assessed that the adjustments were included in the calculation of expected credit losses according to management’s 
methodology. 

To assess the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses, we involved 
internal credit risk modelling specialists. 

Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based 
calculation of expected credit losses. 

Reference to related disclosures  

Information on the inclusion of forward-looking information into the model-based calculation of expected credit losses and their 
adjustments for stages 1 and 2 is provided in notes 1 and 19 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

3.  Expected credit losses for defaulted commercial real estate loans 

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter 

As  of  31  December  2023,  the  Group  recognized  loan  exposures  of  EUR 38,192 million  relating  to  the  non-recourse 
commercial real estate loans business with corresponding allowances of EUR 606 million. 

Identifying  and  calculating  the  expected  credit  losses  for  defaulted  loan  exposures  involves  various  assumptions  and 
estimation inputs, particularly regarding the solvency of the borrower, expectations of future cash flows, observable market 
prices and expected proceeds from the realization of collateral. 

In  view  of  an  increase  in  defaulted  loan  exposures  relating  to  the  commercial  real  estate  business  and  the  economic 
uncertainty and significant use of judgment, we consider expected credit losses (ECL) for defaulted commercial real estate 
loans as a key audit matter. 

Auditor’s response  

We obtained an understanding of the processes for identifying and calculating expected credit losses for borrowers in the 
commercial real estate loans business. We assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls related to 
credit risk rating, the application of default criteria and transfer to stage 3 in accordance with IFRS 9 and the calculation of the 
expected credit loss. 

We evaluated the criteria used by management to determine defaulted loans in accordance with IFRS 9. 

For a sample of commercial real estate loans we analyzed the application of default criteria used for ECL-staging. For loans 
classified  as  stage  3  we  assessed  the  significant  assumptions  concerning  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  from  the  loan 
exposures,  by  assessing  the  collateral  value,  the  solvency  of  the  borrower and  the  publicly  available  market  and  industry 
forecasts. We searched for and evaluated information that corroborates or contradicts management’s forecasted assumptions. 
We also tested the arithmetical accuracy of the expected credit loss calculated for defaulted exposures. 

We involved internal specialists to assess the valuation of commercial real estate collateral on a sample basis. 

Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the expected credit losses for defaulted commercial real estate 
loans. 

Reference to related disclosures 

Information  on  the  Group’s  commercial  real  estate  loans  business  is  included  in  Note 19  of  the  notes  to  the  consolidated 
financial statements as well as the section “IFRS 9 Impairment” in the Risk Report (Combined Management Report), which is 
an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. 

4.  Measurement of goodwill for the Asset Management cash-generating unit  

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter 

As  of  31 December  2023,  the  Group  reported  goodwill  of  EUR 2,849 million  that  was  exclusively  allocated  to  its  Asset 
Management cash-generating unit (CGU). 

For purposes of the impairment test the recoverable amount of the Asset Management CGU is calculated using the discounted 
cash flow model. In this context, significant assumptions are made regarding the earnings projections and the discount rate. 
The discount rate is derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. 

As the measurement of goodwill for the Asset Management CGU is based on a high degree of judgment due to the earnings 
projections and discount rate contained in the discounted cash flow model this is a key audit matter.

Auditor’s response  

We obtained an understanding of the process for preparing the earnings projections and calculating the recoverable amount 
of goodwill for the Asset Management CGU. In this respect, we also obtained an understanding of management’s controls 
regarding the earnings projections and the discount rate, assessed the design of such controls and tested their operating 
effectiveness.  

We analyzed the significant assumptions described above with a focus on significant changes compared with the prior year. 
In this regard, we assessed the consistency and reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in the discounted cash 
flow model by comparing them with external market expectations. 

In analyzing the expected future cash flows of the Asset Management CGU, we compared the earnings projections with the 
prior fiscal year’s projections and with the actual results achieved and evaluated any significant deviations. Furthermore, we 
assessed the discount rate by comparing it to a range of externally available forecasts. 

To assess the above assumptions made in the recoverability of goodwill we involved internal business valuation specialists. 

Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the measurement of the goodwill for the Asset Management CGU. 

Reference to related disclosures 

Information on the measurement of goodwill is provided in notes 1 and 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

5.  Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets 

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter 

As of 31 December 2023, the Group reported net deferred tax assets of EUR 7,227 million. 

The recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is based on the estimation of the ability to utilize unused tax losses 
and  deductible  temporary  differences  against  potential  future  taxable  income.  This  estimate  is  based,  among  others,  on 
assumptions regarding forecasted operating results based upon the approved business plan. 

In light of the use of judgment in estimation of future taxable income and the ability to use tax losses, the recognition and 
measurement of deferred tax assets is a key audit matter. 

Auditor’s response 

We obtained an understanding of the process to determine whether deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses 
are identified in different jurisdictions and measured in accordance with the provisions of tax law and rules for accounting for 
deferred taxes under IAS 12, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the related controls.  

We tested the assumptions used to develop and allocate elements of the approved business plan as a basis for estimating 
the future taxable income of the relevant group companies and tax groups. 

Furthermore, we evaluated the recognition of deferred tax assets by analyzing the key assumptions made in estimating future 
taxable  income.  We  assessed  the  estimates  made  in  the  forecasted  operating  results  by  comparing  the  underlying  key 
assumptions with historical and prospective data available externally. We compared the historical forecasts with the actual 
results.  In  addition,  we  assessed  the  estimated  tax  adjustments  and  we  performed  sensitivity  analyses  on  the  utilization 
periods of the respective deferred tax assets. 

To assess the assumptions used in the recoverability of the deferred taxes, we involved our tax professionals and internal 
business valuation specialists.  

Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the recognition and measurement of the deferred tax assets. 

Reference to related disclosures  

Information  on  the  recognition  and  measurement  of  deferred  tax  assets  is  provided  in  notes 1  and  34  of  the  notes  to  the 
consolidated financial statements.

6.  IT Access and Change Management in the financial reporting  

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter 

The accuracy of the Group’s financial reporting is highly dependent on the reliability and the continuity of the used information 
technology due to the significant number of transactions that are processed daily.  

Given the high dependency on reliable and continuing data processing and given the pervasive nature of IT controls on the 
internal control system, we consider IT Access and Change Management in the Group’s financial reporting as a key audit 
matter. 

Auditor’s response 

We assessed the IT control environment including the IT general controls as well as the IT application controls relevant to the 
Group’s financial reporting. Our procedures also covered the changes during the year on the current IT control environment.  

Moreover, we tested the operating effectiveness of prevent and detect IT general controls related to user access management 
and  change  management  across  applications,  databases  and  operating  systems.  Additionally,  we  tested  IT  application 
controls over automated data processing, data feeds and interfaces. Our audit procedures related to IT access management 
included,  but  were  not  limited  to,  user  access  provisioning  and  removal,  privileged  user  access,  periodic  access  right 
recertifications, system security settings and user authentication controls.  

Our  audit  procedures  related  to  IT  change  management  included,  but  were  not  limited  to,  evaluating  if  changes  in  the 
production environment were tested and approved prior to implementation and the ability to deploy changes was restricted to 
authorized users. 

To  assess  the  IT  Access  and  Change  Management  in  the  Group’s  financial  reporting  process,  we  involved  internal 
professionals who have particular expertise in the area of IT audits. 

Our procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the IT access and change management in the group’s financial 
reporting.“ 

Reference to related disclosures 

For a general description of internal controls over the  financial reporting, we refer to the combined management report in 
section “Internal Control over Financial Reporting”.

Our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and 
consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information referred to above and, in so doing, to consider 
whether the other information  

–  is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, the disclosures in the group management report whose 

content was audited or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  

–  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 

Responsibilities of the executive directors and the Supervisory Board for the 
consolidated financial statements and the group management report 

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material 
respects,  with  IFRSs  as  adopted  by  the  EU  and  the  additional  requirements  of  German  commercial  law  pursuant  to 
Sec. 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the group. In addition, the executive directors 
are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial 
statements  that  are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  (i.e.,  fraudulent  financial  reporting  and 
misappropriation of assets) or error.  

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. 
In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an 
intention to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.  

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, 
provides an appropriate view of the group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial 
statements,  complies  with  German  legal  requirements,  and  appropriately  presents  the  opportunities  and  risks  of  future 
development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they 
have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable 
German  legal  requirements,  and  to  be  able  to  provide  sufficient  appropriate  evidence  for  the  assertions  in  the  group 
management report. 

The  Supervisory  Board  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  group’s  financial  reporting  process  for  the  preparation  of  the 
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.  

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and of the group management report 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an 
appropriate view of the group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements 
and  the  knowledge  obtained  in  the  audit,  complies  with  the  German  legal  requirements  and  appropriately  presents  the 
opportunities  and  risks  of  future  development,  as  well  as  to  issue  an  auditor’s  report  that  includes  our  opinions  on  the 
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. 

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 
HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement 
Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  and  this  group 
management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  

–  Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  of  the  group 
management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and 
obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinions.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
–  Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  of 
arrangements  and  measures  (systems)  relevant  to  the  audit  of  the  group  management  report  in  order  to  design  audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of these systems.  

–  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates 

made by the executive directors and related disclosures.  

–  Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group 
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. 

–  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the 
consolidated  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets,  liabilities,  financial  position  and  financial 
performance of the group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German 
commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB.  

–  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the  group  to  express  opinions  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  on  the  group  management  report.  We  are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinions.  

–  Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with 

[German] law, and the view of the group’s position it provides.  

–  Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management 
report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by 
the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective 
information  from these  assumptions. We  do not express  a  separate  opinion  on  the  prospective  information  and  on  the 
assumptions  used  as  a  basis.  There  is  a  substantial  unavoidable  risk  that  future  events  will  differ  materially  from  the 
prospective information.  

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 

We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a  statement  that we have  complied with  the  relevant  independence 
requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence and where applicable, related safeguards.  

From  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

In our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the file 
identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) 
HGB  for  the  electronic  reporting  format.  Beyond  this  assurance  opinion  and  our  audit  opinions  on  the  accompanying 
consolidated financial statements and the accompanying group management report for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 
31  December  2023  contained  in  the  “Report  on  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  of  the  group 
management report” above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings 
or on the other information contained in the file identified above. 

Basis for the opinion  

We  conducted our assurance work on  the  rendering  of  the  consolidated financial  statements and  the  group  management 
report  contained  in  the  file  identified  above  in  accordance  with  Sec.  317  (3a)  HGB  and  the  IDW  Assurance  Standard:

Group auditor’s responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents  

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or 
unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also: 

–  Identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) 
HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion. 

–  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the 
effectiveness of these controls. 

–  Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the 
requirements  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2019/815,  in  the  version  in  force  at  the  date  of  the  financial 
statements, on the technical specification for this file. 

–  Evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated 

financial statements and to the audited group management report. 

–  Evaluate  whether  the  tagging  of  the  ESEF  documents  with  Inline  XBRL  technology  (iXBRL)  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements of Arts. 4 and 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of 
the financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering. 

Further information pursuant to Art. 10 of the EU Audit Regulation  

We were elected as group auditor by the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2023. We were engaged by the Supervisory 
Board on 8 August 2023. We have been the group auditor of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft uninterrupted since fiscal year 
2020.  

We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor’s report are consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee 
pursuant to Art. 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report). 

Other matter – use of the auditor’s report 

Our auditor’s report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group 
management  report  as  well  as  the  assured  ESEF  documents.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  group 
management  report  converted  to  the  ESEF  format  –  including  the  versions  to  be  published  in  the  Unternehmensregister 
[German  Company  Register]  –  are  merely  electronic  renderings  of  the  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the 
audited  group  management  report  and  do  not  take  their  place.  In  particular,  the  ESEF  report  and  our  assurance  opinion 
contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.

Introduction 
Compensation Report for the Management Board and the Supervisory Board 

Introduction  

The Compensation Report for the year 2023 provides detailed information on compensation in Deutsche Bank Group.  

Compensation Report for the Management Board and the 
Supervisory Board 

The Compensation Report for the Management Board and the Supervisory Board for the 2023 financial year was prepared 
jointly  by  the  Management  Board  and  the  Supervisory  Board  of  Deutsche  Bank  Aktiengesellschaft  (hereinafter:  Deutsche 
Bank  AG  or  the  bank)  in  accordance  with  Section  162  of  the  German  Stock  Corporation  Act.  The  Compensation  Report 
describes the fundamental features of the compensation systems for Deutsche Bank’s Management Board and Supervisory 
Board and provides information on the compensation granted and owed by Deutsche Bank in the 2023 financial year to each 
incumbent or former member of the Management Board and Supervisory Board.  

The Compensation Report fulfills the current legal and regulatory requirements, in particular of Section 162 of the German 
Stock Corporation Act and the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverordnung – InstVV) and takes 
into account the recommendations set out in the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). It is also in compliance with 
the applicable requirements of the accounting rules for capital market-oriented companies (German Commercial Code (HGB), 
International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS))  as  well  as  the  guidelines  issued  by  the  working  group  Guidelines  for 
Sustainable Management Board Remuneration Systems.  

Employee Compensation Report 

This part of the compensation report discloses information with regard to the compensation system and structure that applies 
to the employees in Deutsche Bank Group. The report provides details on the Group Compensation Framework and it outlines 
the  decisions  on  Variable  Compensation  for  2023.  Furthermore,  this  part  contains  quantitative  disclosures  specific  to 
employees  identified  as  Material  Risk  Takers  (MRTs)  in  accordance  with  the  Remuneration  Ordinance  for  Institutions 
(Institutsvergütungsverordnung – InstVV).

Compensation of the Management Board 

Executive Summary 

2023  was  another  year  of  extraordinary  macroeconomic  challenges  and  geopolitical  uncertainty,  in  which  Deutsche  Bank 
provided stability and support for its clients. Deutsche Bank`s Global Hausbank strategy and diversified universal banking 
model were once again put to the test and proved resilient and robust, delivering the best annual pre-tax profit result in 16 
years. With an increase in revenues of 6% to almost € 29 billion, Deutsche Bank grew faster than expected. 

Deutsche Bank´s performance in 2023 was set against a backdrop of continuing high inflation, slower economic growth and 
geopolitical uncertainty with the war in Ukraine and the armed conflict in Israel and Gaza. With its strategic realignment in 
2019  and  subsequent  transformation,  Deutsche  Bank  laid  the  foundation  for  growth  and  sustainable  profitability.  In  2023, 
Deutsche  Bank  significantly  increased  its  shareholder  distributions  while  maintaining  cost  discipline  and  continuing  to 
strengthen its capital base. 

The Supervisory Board considered stakeholders` perspectives very carefully when making compensation decisions. These 
decisions  reflect  its  pay-for-performance  philosophy  while  taking  into  account  individual  and  collective  financial  and  non-
financial performances aligned to the execution of the Global Hausbank strategy with appropriate regard for risks and controls. 
As part of its performance assessment, the Supervisory Board also dealt in detail with the problems and negative effects that 
arose in connection with Project Unity (IT migration of Postbank customer accounts to the Deutsche Bank platform) and, as 
part  of  consequence  management,  took  into  account  the  different  individual  responsibilities  of  the  members  of  the 
Management Board for this matter and made appropriate reductions for the determination of their target achievement levels 
(cut in Short-Term Award achievement levels). 

All compensation decisions are made within the boundaries of multiple regulatory requirements. In this regard, Management 
Board compensation and the pay-out schedules of variable compensation components are limited in several ways. Due to the 
requirements of Section 25a (5) of the German Banking Act and in accordance with the decision of the General Meeting in 
May  2014,  the  ratio  of  fixed  to  variable  compensation  is  generally  limited  to  1:2  (cap  rule).  For  this  reason,  the  fixed 
compensation of Deutsche Bank Management Board members is relatively high compared to other DAX companies that are 
not subject to this regulation. 

The  Compensation  Control  Committee  of  Deutsche Bank  regularly  reviews  the  compensation  system of  the  Management 
Board  members  with  regard  to  market  trends  and  investor  feedback.  As  a  result  of  the  review  process  in  2023,  points  of 
improvement were identified. These are now reflected in a redesigned compensation system, which will be submitted to the 
General Meeting for approval in May 2024 with effect from 2024 onwards. The complexity of the compensation system has 
been  reduced  by  limiting  the  number  of  objectives,  which  leads  to  significantly  increased  transparency.  To  consider  the 
feedback of shareholders, a forward-looking assessment period rather than the previous backward-looking perspective will be 
used from now on for the performance measurement of the Long-Term Incentive. With this change, we aim to foster a long-
term focus and thus the sustainable development of the company. To further strengthen the pay-for-performance alignment 
of  the  compensation  of  Deutsche  Bank,  the  target  achievement  regarding  the  Relative  Total  Shareholder  Return  will  be 
assessed based on a more ambitious approach based on the percentile rank of Deutsche Bank compared to the international 
banks in the peer group. 

For further details regarding the new Management Board compensation system, please refer to the Outlook section of the 
Compensation Report 2023.

Annual Report 2023 

Compensation of the Management Board 
Principles for Management Board Compensation 

Principles for Management Board Compensation 

Responsibility and procedures for setting and reviewing Management Board 
compensation 

The Supervisory Board as a whole is responsible for the decisions on the design of the compensation system as well as for 
setting  the  individual  compensation  amounts  and  procedures  for  awarding  the  compensation.  The  Compensation  Control 
Committee supports the Supervisory Board in its tasks of designing and monitoring the implementation of the system and 
prepares proposals for resolutions for the Supervisory Board. As necessary, the Compensation Control Committee issues 
recommendations for the Supervisory Board to make adjustments to the system. In the case of significant changes, but at 
least every four years, the compensation system for the Management Board is submitted to the General Meeting for approval 
in accordance with Section 120a (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act. The compensation system was last approved by 
the General Meeting 2021 by a majority of 97.76%. 

On  the  basis  of  the  approved  compensation  system,  the  Supervisory  Board  sets  the  target  total  compensation  for  each 
Management  Board  member  for  the  respective  financial  year,  while  taking  into  account  the  scope  and  complexity  of  the 
respective Management Board member’s functional responsibilities, the length of service of the Management Board member 
on the Management Board as well as the company’s financial situation. In the process, the Supervisory Board also considers 
the customary market compensation, also based on both horizontal and vertical comparisons, and sets the upper limit for total 
compensation (maximum compensation) (additional information is provided in the section “Appropriateness of Management 
Board compensation and compliance with the set maximum compensation”).  

Guiding principle: Alignment of Management Board compensation to corporate 
strategy 

Deutsche Bank aims to make a positive contribution to its clients, employees, investors and society in general by fostering 
economic growth and social progress. Deutsche Bank offers its clients solutions and provides an active contribution to foster 
the creation of value by its clients. This approach is also intended to ensure that Deutsche Bank is competitive and profitable 
and can operate on the basis of a strong capital and liquidity position. Deutsche Bank is committed to a corporate culture that 
appropriately aligns risks and revenues.  

At the Annual Media Conference in February 2024, Deutsche Bank confirmed its strategic goals for the Group for the period 
up to 2025. With its four well-balanced and mutually reinforcing businesses, Deutsche Bank´s business model provides a 
stable and promising foundation for capital-efficient business growth, a predictable revenue mix, prudent risk management 
and a strong balance sheet. Deutsche Bank has a clear path and is right on track in executing its Global Hausbank strategy 
for the Group for the period up to 2025 with the aim of sustainably profitable growth and shareholder returns. Since revenues 
have surpassed the Bank´s expectations in the past years, the previous target for 2025 has been raised compared to the 
Bank`s ambition announced at the Investor Deep Dive in March 2022. For the period between 2021 and 2025, the adjusted 
target is a compound annual revenues growth rate of between 5.5% and 6.5%, raised from the Bank`s previous expectation 
of 3.5% to 4.5% and leading to project revenues of approximately € 32 billion in the financial year 2025. At the same time, 
cost discipline remains a high priority. Further efficiency measures were implemented in 2023 to bring the cost/income ratio 
below 62.5% by 2025 and free up capacity for investments and improve operational leverage in order to generate an attractive 
Return  on  Tangible  Equity  of  above  10%.  The  capital  distribution  objectives  are  to  be  achieved  through  a  combination  of 
dividends and share buy-backs with the aim of a payout ratio of 50% from financial year 2024 onwards. The Bank will continue 
to focus on conduct and controls and follow a clear management agenda to change the way of working, to become even more 
innovative and remain an employer of choice. 

In the interests of the shareholders, the Management Board compensation system is aligned to the business strategy as well 
as  the  sustainable  and  long-term  development  of  Deutsche  Bank  and  provides  suitable  incentives  for  a  consistent 
achievement of the set targets. Through the composition of total compensation comprising fixed and variable compensation 
components, through the assessment of performance over short-term and long-term periods and through the consideration of 
relevant,  challenging  performance  parameters,  the  implementation  of  the  Group  strategy  and  the  alignment  with  the 
sustainable and long-term performance of the Group are rewarded in a clear and understandable manner. The structure of 
the targets and objectives therefore comprises a balanced mix of both financial and non-financial parameters and indicators. 

Through the structuring of the compensation system, the members of the Management Board get incentivized by achieving 
the targets and objectives linked to Deutsche Bank’s strategy, when working individually and as a team continually towards 
the long-term positive development of Deutsche Bank, without taking on disproportionately high risks. The Supervisory Board 
thus ensures there is always a strong link between compensation and performance in line with shareholder interests (“pay for 
performance”).

Principles for Management Board Compensation 

Compensation principles 

The  design  of  the  compensation  system  and  thus  the  assessment  of  individual  compensation  amounts  are  based  on  the 
compensation principles outlined below. The Supervisory Board takes them into consideration when adopting its resolutions 
in this context: 

Corporate strategy 

  The compensation system for the Management Board members is closely linked to Deutsche Bank’s 

strategy, thereby focusing their work on its implementation and the long-term positive development of the 
Group, without taking disproportionate risks. 

Shareholders’ interests 

  The interests of shareholders are always taken into account when designing the specific structure of the 

Individual and collective objectives 

  Setting individual, divisional and collective objectives fosters not only the sustainable and long-term 

compensation system, determining individual compensation amounts and structuring the means of 
compensation allocation and delivery. 

Long-term perspective 

development of each of the business divisions, infrastructure areas or regions the Management Board 
members are responsible for, but also the performance of the Management Board as a collective 
management body. 

  A long-term link to Deutsche Bank’s performance is secured by setting a greater percentage of long-term 
objectives in comparison to short-term objectives and by granting variable compensation exclusively in 
deferred form and mostly as share-based compensation with vesting and holding periods of up to seven 
years. 

Sustainability 

  Objectives in accordance with Deutsche Bank’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy 

Appropriateness and upper limits (caps) 

Transparency 

Governance 

provide incentives for acting responsibly, also in the context of sustainability, and thus make an important 
contribution to Deutsche Bank`s long-term performance. 

  The appropriateness of the compensation amounts is ensured through the review of the compensation 
based on a horizontal comparison with peers and a vertical comparison with the workforce as well as 
suitable compensation caps on the achievable variable compensation and maximum compensation. 
  By avoiding unnecessary complexity in the structures and through clear and understandable reporting, 

the transparency of the compensation system is increased in accordance with the expectations of 
investors and the public as well as the regulatory requirements. 

  The structuring of the compensation system and the assessment to determine the individual 
compensation take place within the framework of the statutory and regulatory requirements.

Compensation-related developments in 2023 

Compensation-related developments in 2023  

Development of business and alignment of Management Board compensation to 
corporate strategy in 2023 

Management Board compensation is closely aligned to Deutsche Bank’s strategic targets. All the individual and collective 
objectives agreed with the Management Board members as well as their assessment parameters for the 2023 financial year 
were discussed by the Compensation Control Committee at the beginning of the year and subsequently resolved on by the 
Supervisory Board. The objectives serve overall in fostering the strategic transformation of the Group. The achievement levels 
determined  for the  objectives  for the  2023  financial  year at  the  beginning  of  the  year 2024  reflect  the  extent to  which  the 
individual objectives were achieved and thus contributed to the Bank’s performance.  

Since 2019 the management team has successfully transformed Deutsche Bank. By refocusing the Bank’s business around 
its core strengths, it has become significantly more profitable, better balanced and more cost-efficient. Thanks to the disciplined 
execution of its strategy, the Bank has been able to serve its clients through highly challenging conditions in a volatile world, 
proving its resilience with strong risk discipline and sound capital management.  

Profit before tax amounted to € 5.7 billion at the end of 2023. This is a slight increase of 2% over the previous year and the 
highest in sixteen years despite more than € 1 billion non-operating costs. Post-tax return on Tangible Equity fell over the 
course of last year to 7.4% due to tax effects in 2022 and 2023, whereby a greater positive impact was seen in 2022. Revenues 
increased by 6% versus 2022 to € 28.9 billion euros, driven by the rise in global interest rates and in particular by the success 
of the Bank’s broad client base with an increase in business, especially in the Corporate and Private Banks, which saw the 
highest revenue growth rate in  2023. At the same time, Deutsche Bank managed to keep adjusted costs nearly stable at 
€ 20.6 billion, with a consistent cost/income ratio of 75% for the full year.  

Reflecting the profitability of all business segments in 2023, the Corporate and the Private Bank were the most important 
growth drivers. Both divisions achieved record profits. Corporate Bank net revenues were € 7.7 billion in 2023, up 22% year-
on-year.  All  Corporate  Bank  business  areas  achieved  double-digit  growth,  while  innovative  product  developments  and 
investments in capacities for future business generated positive effects. Private Bank net revenues were € 9.6 billion, up 5% 
year-on-year. Adjusted for specific items, such as the sale of the financial sales organization in Italy, Private Bank revenues 
even increased by 10%. This was primarily due to a strong deposit business with improved margins. Growth was driven in 
particular by the Private Clients Bank Germany, where revenues were 14% higher than in the previous year. Adjusted for the 
specific  items,  the  International  Private  Clients  Bank  achieved  revenues  growth  of  3%.  In  the  Investment  Bank,  revenues 
totaled EUR 9.2 billion, 9% below the very high level of 2022. Revenues in the Origination and Advisory business increased 
by 25%, in particular due to the bond issuing business and the non-repeat of mark-to-market losses on funded and unfunded 
commitments  in  leveraged  debt  capital  markets.  Through  the  acquisition  of  Numis,  the  leading  UK  corporate  broker, 
investments were made in customer advisory services in order to generate higher commission and fee income in the long 
term.  

The 2023 results demonstrate the benefits of Deutsche Bank’s transformation efforts. The Bank delivered revenues growth in 
its core businesses and continued cost discipline. The risk provisions are in line with the Bank’s guidance, despite challenging 
conditions. Focused de-risking of the balance sheet has contributed to the solid Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.7%. 

The individual objectives are bundled in the short-term component (Short-Term Award (STA)) and account for a share of 40% 
of the target total variable compensation. The Supervisory Board determined an achievement level for these components for 
the 2023 financial year between 61.52% and 116.38%. The performance of the Management Board as a collective body is 
reflected in the long-term component (Long-Term Award (LTA)), which accounts for a share of 60% of the target total variable 
compensation. Overall, the achievement level of the collective objectives based solely on the 2023 financial year was 73.69%. 
This achievement level accounts for 60% of the Long-Term Award to be granted for the 2023 financial year. As achievement 
levels for prior years (at 30% from 2022 and 10% from 2021) also affected the Long-Term Award for the 2023 financial year, 
the achievement level for this component for the 2023 financial year was 77.53% based on the weighted achievement levels 
of the three financial years. Details on the individual achievement levels are presented as an overview in this report under the 
heading “Application of the compensation system in the financial year”.

Compensation-related developments in 2023 

Changes on the Management Board and Compensation Decisions in 2023 

With effect from June 1 and July 1, 2023, respectively the Supervisory Board resolved changes in the functional responsibilities 
assigned to individual Management Board members. Claudio de Sanctis was appointed member of the Management Board 
with effect from July 1, 2023, for a period of three years. Christiana Riley left the Management Board at the end of May 17, 
2023. Karl von Rohr left the Management Board with effect from October 31, 2023.  

The Management Board comprised 9 members at the end of 2023 with a proportion of women of 11%. Deutsche Bank thereby 
fulfils the statutory requirements but remains behind its ambitions. As outlined at the AGM 2023, the Supervisory Board is not 
satisfied  with  the  representation  of  women  at  the  Management  Board  and  stands  by  the  commitment  to  increase  the 
percentage of female representation at the Management Board, and to foster and reward a culture of diversity, equity and 
inclusion  more  broadly.  As  part  of  the  Bank’s  new  compensation  system,  the  Supervisory  Board  seeks  to  integrate  this 
ambition more firmly into the performance goals of the Management Board members. Generally, the reduced Management 
Board has been positively acknowledged internally and externally as being efficient. 

In its meeting on July 27, 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to grant a Dividend Equivalent Award of EUR 0.30 per share 
to Management Board members with share-based deferred compensation awards that were in the holding period at the time 
of the General Meeting 2023. A Dividend Equivalent is a right to receive a cash payment on the respective release date based 
on the amount of dividends that would have been paid during the retention period on the number of vested Deutsche Bank 
shares that are released on the Release Date. The Dividend Equivalent Awards will be calculated based on the dividend paid 
per Deutsche Bank share multiplied by the number of Deutsche Bank share units subject to the holding requirement (a fixed 
EUR value). Dividend Equivalents are subject to the same provisions as the underlying Award, including but not limited to 
suspension, forfeiture or clawback. 

The Supervisory Board reviews the compensation levels of the members of the Management Board annually and regularly 
engages external compensation advisors to support the review, while assuring that these advisors are independent from the 
Management  Board  and  Deutsche  Bank.  In  2023,  the  Supervisory  Board  conducted  a  review  of  the  compensation  levels 
taking into account comparable companies (peer groups) with the support of an external compensation advisor. On the basis 
of the results of this review and taking into account other aspects such as the duration of membership in the Management 
Board  or  changes  in  the  area  of  responsibility  within  the  Management  Board,  the  Supervisory  Board  took  the  following 
compensation decisions in 2023:  

A benchmarking study commissioned by the Supervisory Board showed that the level of compensation for the member of the 
Management Board responsible for the Corporate and Investment Bank is lower for this role compared to the peer group of 
international banks. Compared to international banks, the overall target compensation is between the 25. percentile and the 
median. For this reason and taking into account the duration of Fabrizio Campelli’s membership of the Management Board, 
the  Supervisory  Board  decided  to  increase  his  total  target  compensation  to  a  more  market-oriented  overall  target 
compensation of € 8.8 million p.a. This represents an increase of 25.71% (an increase in base salary of 21.43%) with effect 
from April 1, 2023.  

The target compensation of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) was also increased with effect from April 1, 2023. In this context, 
the Supervisory Board has assessed the CFO’s senior position in the Bank and his role as President of Deutsche Bank AG in 
comparison  to  the  other  roles  on  the  Management  Board  and  took  into  account  the  duration  of  his  membership  of  the 
Management  Board,  considering  another  three  years  in  the  light  of  the  extension  of  his  appointment  as  member  of  the 
Management  Board  with  effect  from  July  1,  2023.  James  von  Moltke`s  overall  target  compensation  was  increased  to 
€ 8.3 million p.a. This represents an increase of 12.16% (an increase in base salary of 6.67%). 

In order to ensure uniform compensation structures for all Management Board members, the Supervisory Board also reviewed 
the ratio of fixed to variable compensation. According to regulatory requirements, variable compensation must not exceed 
200% of the fixed compensation. With two exceptions, the target compensation of all members of the Management Board is 
consistently measured in such a way that, if the fulfillment of all objectives is fully achieved, this regulatory ceiling can be 
reached. To be consistent, the variable target compensation of Christian Sewing and Karl von Rohr were increased by 3.33% 
and 6.76% respectively with effect from April 1, 2023. Base salaries remained unchanged. 

The total target compensation for Claudio de Sanctis in his capacity as a member of the Management Board and head of the 
Private  Bank  was  set  at  € 7.9 million  p.a.  with  effect  from  July  1,  2023,  i.e.,  from  his  appointment  as  a  member  of  the 
Management Board.

Compensation of the Management Board 
Compensation-related developments in 2023 

The Supervisory Board took into account as a positive aspect the financial milestones achieved and the contributions of the 
individual members of the Management Board to this success in their performance evaluations. When determining the variable 
compensation for the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board acknowledged the continued efforts of the members of the 
Management Board in driving regulatory remediation activities. Although there are positive signals from the regulators since 
substantial control remediation progress was achieved, particularly in the USA and the UK, the Supervisory Board took into 
consideration that these remediation measures need continued focus across the Bank. 

The Supervisory Board analyzed and assessed in detail the problems and negative consequences for customers in connection 
with  Project  Unity  (IT  migration  of  Postbank  customer  accounts  to  the  Deutsche  Bank  platform).  Although  the  technical 
migration of data records was implemented accurately on the system side, the impact on customer services and processes 
was clearly underestimated. In the opinion of both the Supervisory Board and the Management Board, the large number of 
customers who experienced limitations as a result of the migration is unacceptable. In executing this integration program, the 
Bank failed to meet its own high standards and the expectations of its customers. Even though fast and massive adjustments 
were subsequently carried out and investments were made in additional resource capacity, IT and automated processes in 
order to eliminate the backlogs as quickly as possible, the Supervisory Board took into account the overall view of the issue 
when assessing performance with regard to granting variable compensation. In doing so, the individual degrees to which the 
individual  Management  Board  members  were  accountable  for  the  issues  were  taken  into  account  and,  based  on  the 
recommendation of the Compensation Control Committee, it was decided to reduce the individual achievement level for the 
short-term component of selected Management Board members involved. 

Details  on  how  the  Short-Term  Award  is  calculated  are  presented  in  this  report  under  the  heading  “Application  of  the 
compensation system in the financial year”.

Compensation of the Management Board 
Principles governing the determination of compensation 

Overview 

Detailed information on the compensation system for members of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG is available 
on the company’s website: Compensation system for the Management Board Members from January 2021 onwards. 

Composition of the target total compensation and maximum compensation 

The  Supervisory  Board  determines  for  each  Management  Board  member  a  target  total  compensation  on  the  basis  of  the 
compensation system approved by the General Meeting. It also determines, in accordance with the recommendation of the 
German Corporate Governance Code, what relative proportions the fixed compensation on the one hand and short-term and 
long-term variable compensation on the other hand have in the target total compensation. In this context, the Supervisory 
Board ensures in particular that the variable compensation linked to achieving long-term objectives exceeds the portion of 
variable compensation linked to short-term objectives. 

When setting the target total compensation for each member of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board takes into 
account the  scope  and  complexity  of  the  respective  Management  Board  member’s  functional  responsibility  as  well  as  the 
experience and length of service of the member on the Management Board. Furthermore, the compensation amounts are 
reviewed for their appropriateness on the basis of market data for suitable peer groups. On the basis of these criteria, the 
Supervisory Board set  the  relative  percentages  for  the  compensation  components within  the target  total  compensation  as 
follows:

Annual Report 2023 

Compensation of the Management Board 
Principles governing the determination of compensation 

The compensation of the Management Board members is limited (capped) in several ways (maximum compensation).  

Pursuant  to  Section  25a  (5)  of  the  German  Banking  Act  (Kreditwesengesetz  –  KWG),  the  ratio  of  fixed  to  variable 
compensation is generally limited to 1:1 (cap regulation), i.e. the amount of variable compensation must not exceed that of 
fixed compensation, unless the shareholders of a bank resolve to increase the ratio of fixed to variable compensation to up to 
1:2. The General Meeting in May 2014 made use of this possibility and increased the ratio to 1:2. 

The Supervisory Board additionally limited the maximum possible achievement levels for the short-term objectives (STA) and 
long-term objectives (LTA) consistently to 150% of the target variable compensation. Furthermore, it specified an additional 
amount limit (cap) for the aggregate amount of base salary, STA and LTA of € 9.85 million. This means that even with target 
achievement levels that would lead to higher compensation amounts, compensation is capped at a maximum of € 9.85 million. 
After the target achievement level is assessed, if the calculation should result in variable compensation or total compensation 
that exceeds one of the specified caps, the variable compensation is to be reduced. This is to take place through a pro rata 
reduction of the STA and LTA.

In addition, in accordance with Section 87a (1) sentence 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board 
also set an upper limit for the maximum total compensation of € 12 million for each Management Board member (Maximum 
Compensation).  The  Maximum  Compensation  is  set  consistently  for  all  Management  Board  members.  The  Maximum 
Compensation corresponds to the sum of all compensation components for any financial year. This comprises not only the 
base salary, STA and LTA, but also the fringe benefits and service costs for the company pension plan or pension allowances.

Application of the compensation system in the financial year 

Application of the compensation system in the financial year 

Fixed compensation 

The fixed compensation components in the form of base salary, fringe benefits and contributions to the pension plan or pension 
allowances were granted in the financial year as fixed compensation and in accordance with the individual agreements in the 
service contracts. Due to the requirements of Section 25a (5) of the German Banking Act and in accordance with the decision 
of the Annual General Meeting in May 2014, the ratio of fixed to variable compensation is generally limited to 1:2 (cap rule). 
Therefore, when determining the amount of base salary as part of the target compensation, it must be taken into account that 
the variable compensation may not exceed the maximum value of 200% of the fixed compensation. 

The expenses for fringe benefits and pension service costs vary in their annual amounts. Although the contribution to Deutsche 
Bank’s pension plan is defined consistently for all Management Board members, the amounts to be contributed by Deutsche 
Bank during the year in the form of pension service cost accruals vary based on the length of service on the Management 
Board within the financial year, the age of the Management Board member and actuarial figures (additional information is 
provided in the section “Benefits upon regular contract termination”). 

Variable compensation 

The  Supervisory  Board,  based  on  the  proposal  of  the  Compensation  Control  Committee,  determined  the  variable 
compensation  for  the  Management  Board  members  for  the  2023  financial  year.  Variable  compensation  comprises  two 
components, a short-term component (Short-Term Award (STA)) with a weighting of 40% and a long-term component (Long-
Term Award (LTA)) with a weighting of 60% in relation to the target variable compensation.  

All objectives, measurements and assessment criteria that were used for the assessment of performance for the 2023 financial 
year  are  derived  from  Deutsche  Bank’s  strategy  and  are  in  line  with  the  compensation  system  approved  by  the  General 
Meeting.  The  objectives  were  selected  to  set  suitable  incentives  for  the  Management  Board  members,  to  promote  the 
development of Deutsche Bank’s earnings and the alignment to the interests of shareholders as well as to fulfill Deutsche 
Bank’s social responsibility through the inclusion of sustainability aspects and climate protection. The challenging objectives 
reflect the Bank’s ambitions. If the objectives are not achieved, the variable compensation can be zero; in the case of over-
achievement, the maximum achievement level is limited to 150% of the target value. 

Balance of financial and non-financial objectives 

Financial and non-financial objectives are considered in a balanced way when setting the objectives. In relation to the total 
variable compensation, there was a greater focus on financial objectives in the 2023 financial year, with a weighting of around 
68%. Both the financial and non-financial objectives were chosen in such a way that they are quantitatively or qualitatively 
measurable at the end of the financial year. Around 75% of the targets are quantitatively measurable and a portion of around 
25% is measured qualitatively. 

Short-Term Award (STA) 

The amount of the Short-Term Award for the 2023 financial year is based on the achievement level during the assessment 
period of the short-term individual and divisional objectives. The assessment period coincides with the financial year and is 
one year.  

The Short-Term Award comprises the following two elements with different weightings: 

–  Individual Objectives and Behavior Objective (62.5%) 
–  Individual Balanced Scorecards and Key Deliverables (37.5%) 

For each of these components, the Supervisory Board determines the achievement level based on a clearly structured year-
end  assessment  process  at  the  beginning  of  the  following  year.  The  achievement  of  the  two  components  determines  the 
overall  achievement  level  for  each  Management  Board  member  which  in  turn  determines  the  amount  of  the  short-term 
component for the preceding financial year.

Individual objectives 
The Supervisory Board sets personal and divisional objectives (Individual Objectives) for each member of the Management 
Board at the beginning of the year. The weightings of each of these objectives as well as relevant quantitatively or qualitatively 
measurable  performance  criteria  for  their  assessment  are  defined  as  well.  The  objectives  are  chosen  so  that  they  are 
challenging,  ambitious  and  sufficiently  concrete  in  order  to  ensure  there  is  an  appropriate  alignment  of  performance  and 
compensation and that the “pay-for-performance” principle is taken into account.  

The  Individual  Objectives  are  derived  from  the  corporate  strategy  and  foster  its  implementation.  They  are  set  for  each 
Management Board member in consideration of his or her respective area of functional responsibility and the contribution of 
this  area  of  functional  responsibility  to  advancing  Deutsche  Bank’s  overall  strategy.  ESG  objectives  such  as  the  further 
development of the sustainability strategy or the promotion of measures to improve regulatory remediation are also included 
as  individual  objectives.  Individual  Objectives  can  also  be  defined  as  project  or  regional  targets.  Besides  operational 
measures,  the  implementation of  strategic  projects  and  initiatives  can  be  agreed  as  objectives  as  well,  if  they  are directly 
instrumental in the implementation of the strategy, by contributing to, for example, the structure, organization and sustainable 
development of Deutsche Bank. 

At the beginning of the 2023 financial year, a maximum of 4 Individual Objectives were set with different weightings for each 
Management  Board  member.  For  these  objectives,  the  Supervisory  Board  has  assigned  clear  expectations  and  financial 
and/or non-financial performance criteria at the beginning of the year, such as financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), 
achievements of milestones, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and/or Supervisory Board feedback, stakeholder Feedback and 
qualitative  assessments.  These  enable  the  Supervisory  Board  to  objectively  assess  the  performance  contribution  of  the 
respective Management Board member towards the concrete execution of the objectives. 

In addition to the individual objectives the Supervisory Board evaluates the behavior of each Management Board member by 
reflecting on individual performance against the Bank´s key values and beliefs as well as corresponding leadership behavior 
rules.  Focus  Topics  in  2023  were  Integrity,  Innovation  and  Sustainable  Performance.  With  regard  to  the  linkage  between 
behavior and Management Board compensation the Supervisory Board expects the Management Board members to act as 
role models. Only outstanding performance that goes beyond the expectations of the respective role is incentivized.  

At year-end, the determination of the achievement levels follows a pre-defined process. In a first step, all members of the 
Management  Board  perform  an  initial  self-assessment  of  the  achievement  levels  of  their  objectives.  The  self-assessed 
achievement  levels  are  then  discussed  in  conversations  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  (CEO)  and  the  Chairman  of  the 
Supervisory  Board  and  the  Compensation  Control  Committee.  Based  on  the  feedback  from  these  conversations,  the 
Compensation  Control  Committee  prepares  a  proposal  for  the  Supervisory  Board  for  its  decision.  For  this  purpose  the 
achievement levels are combined into an average for each Management Board member according to pre-defined weightings.  

The following overview shows the objectives as well as the achievement levels as resolved on by the Supervisory Board for 
each Management Board member.

2  There was no assessment of individual objectives as the achievement level for the Short-Term Award was set in relation to his departure from the Management Board in 

accordance with the previous year´s level 

For  the  qualitative  objectives,  the  Supervisory  Board  formulated  expectations  and  financial  and/or  non-financial 
performance criteria at the beginning of the year, which enable it to objectively assess the performance contribution of 
the  respective  Management  Board  members  with  regard  to  the  concrete  implementation  of  each  objective  for  the 
performance year at the beginning of the following year. The degrees of achievement thus determined for the individual 
objectives are consolidated into an average for each Management Board member according to the weightings defined 
in advance. The degree of target achievement determined accordingly is multiplied by the target amount of 62.5% of 
the variable target compensation for the STA. This results in the calculated payout amount for the component of the 
individual objectives.

Individual Balanced Scorecard and Key Deliverables 
Balanced Scorecards make it possible to have an overview of key performance indicators and transform strategic objectives 
into operating practices through concrete actions and enable consequent cascading into the organization. With the Balanced 
Scorecards, the Bank has an appropriate tool for the steering and control of key performance indicators that can be used to 
check the achievement level of financial and non-financial objectives against pre-defined measurement parameters at any 
time and to measure them transparently for the performance year at the beginning of the following year. At the same time, the 
Balanced Scorecards provide an overview of the priorities of the individual divisions across the entire Group.  

Based  on  the  functional  responsibilities  according  to  the  Business  Allocation  Plan  for  the  Management  Board,  each 
Management  Board  member  is  assigned  at  least  one  individual  Balanced  Scorecard  and  a  maximum  of  4  Balanced 
Scorecards. If more than one Balanced Scorecard is assigned to a Management Board member, these are weighted based 
on the size and complexity of the associated activities effected on each Scorecard. Four Management Board members have 
more than one Balanced Scorecard due to their multiple functional and/or divisional responsibilities. The table below shows 
the number of Balanced Scorecards and their respective weightings.

The respective Management Board members’ functional responsibilities are linked with pre-defined key financial figures and 
non-financial targets from up to three categories. The three categories are:  

A total of 66 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are assigned to these categories, of which a set of 7 to 16 KPIs are embedded 
in each individual Balanced Scorecard depending on the Management Board member`s area of functional responsibility. The 
methodology for the Balanced Scorecards has been further developed since their introduction in 2018 and adjusted to meet 
the  developing  focus.  For  example,  in  order  to  foster  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance  (ESG)  aspects  in  the 
compensation system, ESG topics have been given an even greater consideration since 2021 in the Balanced Scorecards 
and also in the Long-Term Award (LTA).  

The KPIs within the individual categories are set at the beginning of the year for each Management Board member individually 
along with corresponding targets, thresholds and assessment parameters. In addition, a weighting is set for each category. 
The weightings that the individual categories have within the overall Balanced Scorecard can be up to 65% depending on the 
functional responsibility of the Management Board member. The KPIs of the Balanced Scorecards are measured continuously 
throughout the year, but the overall assessment is made at the end of the year.  

The calculation logic for determining the final levels of achievement for each Management Board member is as follows: 

In a first step, the achievement band of each KPI is determined. If a minimum threshold value is not reached, the achievement 
level for this KPI is set at zero. Once a maximum limit for a KPI has been reached, the achievement level is set at 150%. For 
a  clear  overview,  the  Balanced  Scorecard  shows  if  each  individual  KPI  was  fulfilled  or  exceeded  based  on  the  defined 
assessment criteria (“green”), or only achieved to less than 100% (“amber”) or not achieved (“red”).  

In a second step, the achievement level for each category is calculated taking into account the assessment of the KPIs from 
the first step and the resulting bands applicable to the respective category. When all objectives of a category are exceeded, 
the achievement level for a category can be up to 150%. However, if none of the minimum threshold values of a category is 
met, the achievement level is 0%.

Long-Term Award (LTA) 

When determining variable compensation, a significant focus is placed on the achievement of long-term objectives linked to 
Deutsche Bank’s strategy. To emphasize this, the Supervisory Board decided that the Long-Term Award (LTA) will account 
for 60% of the total target variable compensation. At the beginning of each financial year, the Supervisory Board specifies the 
collective long-term objectives for the Management Board members for the LTA. The objectives and their weightings in the 
LTA for 2023 are: 

–  ESG Objectives (33.33%) 
–  Relative Total Shareholder Return of the Deutsche Bank share (25%) 
–  Group Financials (41.67%) 

All LTA objectives are assessed over a period of three years. 60% of the target compensation for each objective is multiplied 
by the target level achieved in the performance year and thus makes up the largest share for that respective financial year. 
30% of the applicable objective target compensation is based on the achievement level for the preceding financial year and 
10%  is  determined  based  on  the  achievement  level  for  the  financial  year  before  that.  This  results  in  a  weighted  overall 
achievement level for the performance year.

ESG Objectives 
Deutsche Bank has set for itself the aim of spearheading sustainability initiatives such as decarbonization and thus contributing 
to a more environmentally, socially and financially well-governed economy. To link Management Board compensation closely 
and  consistently  to  the  Bank’s  sustainability  strategy,  the  Supervisory  Board  resolved  to  combine  the  Bank’s  strategic 
sustainability targets in an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) component and to implement the results as one of 
the collective objectives within the LTA (ESG component).  

The ESG component accounts for a share of 33.33% of the LTA. This corresponds to 20% of the total variable compensation 
and  emphasizes  the  importance  of  the  ESG  agenda  for  Deutsche  Bank.  At  the  beginning  of  each  financial  year,  the 
Supervisory Board sets targets as well as upper limits and lower limits for all the objectives bundled in the ESG component. 
The assessment of the achievement levels for the financial year takes place retrospectively. A linear calculation methodology 
is used to assess the achievement levels for the quantitative measurable KPIs (all except AML/KYC remediation activities) in 
the categories of 0% and 100%, 100% and 100% to 150%. The following table shows the target amounts, the results as of 
the end of the year and the resulting achievement level for the 2023 financial year:

An  overall  achievement  level  for  the  ESG  component  for  the  2023  financial  year  was  calculated  based  on  the  weighted 
achievement levels for the seven sub-objectives and set at 71.32%. This results in a weighted overall achievement level of 
71.04% for the three-year period for the portion of the LTA attributable to the ESG component.  

Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR) 
A key strategic target of the Bank is the performance of the Deutsche Bank share in comparison to the performance of the 
shares of its competitors (Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR)). The target for the RTSR for the Deutsche Bank share 
in comparison to selected financial institutions is intended to strengthen the sustainable performance of the Deutsche Bank 
share. The RTSR links the interests of the Management Board with those of shareholders. In addition, the RTSR provides a 
relative measurement of performance, creating an incentive to outperform the relevant peers. The Total Shareholder Return 
is defined as the share price performance plus theoretically reinvested gross dividends. The RTSR is derived and calculated 
based on the Total Shareholder Return of the Deutsche Bank share in relation to the average Total Shareholder Returns of 
the peer group.  

If the RTSR is greater than 100%, then the target achievement level increases proportionally to an upper limit of 150% of the 
target figure, i.e., the target achievement level increases by 1% for each percentage point above 100%. If the RTSR average 
is less than 100%, the target achievement level declines disproportionately. For each percentage point decline of the RTSR 
in the range of less than 100% and 80%, the target achievement level declines by two percentage points. For each percentage 
point  decline  of  the  RTSR  in  the  range  between  less  than  80%  and  60%,  the  target  achievement  level  declines  by  three 
percentage points. If the RTSR does not exceed 60% over the entire assessment period, the target achievement level is zero.

The peer group used as the basis for calculating the RTSR is selected from among the companies with generally comparable 
business activities as well as a comparable size and international presence. The Supervisory Board reviews the composition 
of  the  peer  group  regularly.  In  2021  and  2022  the  peer  group  for  the  RTSR  comprised  the  following  11  banks:  Banco 
Santander, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Société Générale, 
UBS and UniCredit. In 2023, Credit Suisse was removed from the peer group, so that the number of banks included was 
reduced to 10 banks.

the overall period of three years for the granting of the portion of the LTA attributable to the RTSR.

Group Financials 
For the financial year 2023 the previously two separate components “Organic Capital Growth” and “Group Component” were 
combined  into  “Group Financials" with  a weighting  of  25%. Since  Organic Capital  Growth and  RoTE  accurately  reflect  an 
increase in capital, Organic Capital Growth was removed as a separate objective. 

Through the Group Financials, the Supervisory Board links the key financial figures supporting the corporate strategy with the 
Management Board’s compensation and thus establishes an incentive to sustainably foster the Bank’s capital, risk, costs and 
earnings profile.

Application of the compensation system in the financial year 

Appropriateness of Management Board compensation and compliance with the 
set maximum compensation 

The  Supervisory  Board  regularly  reviews  the  appropriateness  of  the  individual  compensation  components  as  well  as  the 
amount of total compensation. The review of the appropriateness of Management Board compensation concluded that the 
Management Board compensation resulting from the achievement levels for the 2023 financial year is appropriate. 

Horizontal appropriateness 

Through the horizontal comparison, the Supervisory Board ensures that the target total compensation is appropriate in relation 
to the tasks and achievements of the Management Board as well as the company’s situation and is also customary in the 
market. In this context, the level and structure of compensation, in particular, are examined at comparable companies (peer 
groups). Suitable companies in consideration of Deutsche Bank’s market position (in particular with regard to business sector, 
size and country) are used as the basis for this comparison. The assessment of horizontal appropriateness takes place in 
comparison with the following three peer groups.  

Peer Group 1:  
This group consists of 10 global banks with  
–  a comparable business model; and 
–  a comparable size (measured by balance sheet total, number of employees and market capitalization). 

The 10 institutions in this Peer Group are identical to the banks used to measure the Relative Total Shareholder Return (see 
Chapter "Relative Total Shareholder Return"). These are the following: Banco Santander, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP 
Paribas, Citigroup, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Société Générale, UBS and UniCredit.  

Peer Group 2: 
This group consists of 15 European banks with 
–  a comparable business model; and 
–  a comparable size (measured by balance sheet total, number of employees and market capitalization). 

These are the following banks: Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, Banco Santander, Barclays, BNP Paribas, BPCE, Rabobank, 
Crédit Agricole, Crédit Mutuel, HSBC Holdings, ING Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Nordea Bank, Société Générale, UBS Group and 
UniCredit.  

Peer Group 3: 
This group includes the companies of the German Stock Index (DAX).  

The horizontal appropriateness of the Management Board compensation is reviewed annually by the Supervisory Board. The 
Supervisory  Board  regularly  engages  external  compensation  advisors  for  the  review  of  horizontal  appropriateness,  while 
assuring itself that these advisors are independent from the Management Board and Deutsche Bank. The Supervisory Board 
takes  the  results  of  the  review  into  consideration  when  setting  the  target  total  compensation  for  the  Management  Board 
members. 

Vertical appropriateness 

In  addition  to  the  horizontal  comparison,  the  Supervisory  Board  considers  a  vertical  comparison,  which  compares  the 
compensation  of  the  Management  Board  and  the  compensation  of  the  workforce.  Within  the  vertical  comparison,  the 
Supervisory Board considers in particular, in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code, the development of 
the compensation over time. This involves a comparison of the Management Board compensation and the compensation of 
two  groups  of  employees.  Taken  into  account are,  on  the  one  hand, the  compensation  of  the  senior management,  which 
comprises the first management level below the Management Board and members of the top executive committees of the 
divisions,  as  well  as  of  management  board  members  of  significant  institutions  within  Deutsche  Bank  Group  and  of 
corresponding management board-1 level positions with management responsibility. The Management Board compensation 
is compared to, on the other hand, the compensation of all other employees of Deutsche Bank Group worldwide (tariff and 
non-tariff employees).

Annual Report 2023 

Compensation of the Management Board 
Application of the compensation system in the financial year 

Compliance with the set maximum compensation (cap) 

The maximum compensation limit (cap) is set at € 12 million for each Management Board member. This is based on the actual 
expense and/or actual disbursement of the compensation awarded for a financial year. The base salaries are fixed amounts. 
The expenses for fringe benefits vary from Management Board member to Management Board member in any given year. 
The contribution to Deutsche Bank’s pension plan or pension allowance is set at the same amount for all Management Board 
members. However, the amount to be recognized by the Bank during the year for Deutsche Bank’s pension service costs 
fluctuates based on actuarial variables. As the expense amount for the multi-year variable compensation components of the 
Short-Term Award (STA) and Long-Term Award (LTA) are not determined until up to seven years due to the deferral periods, 
compliance  with  the  maximum  compensation  set  for  the  2023  financial  year  can  only  be  conclusively  reported  within  the 
framework of the Compensation Reports for the financial years up to 2031. Compliance with the maximum compensation limit 
as defined under Section 87a of the German Stock Corporation Act is, however, already ensured for the 2023 financial year. 

Deferrals and holding periods 

The  Remuneration  Ordinance  for  Institutions  (InstitutsVergV)  generally  stipulates  a  three-year  assessment  period  for  the 
determination of the variable compensation for Management Board members. Deutsche Bank complies with this requirement 
by assessing each of the objectives of the Long-Term Award (LTA) over a three-year period. If the relevant three years cannot 
be attributed to a member of the Management Board because the member joined the Bank only recently, the achievement 
level for the objectives will be determined for the period that can be attributed to the member. The deferral period for the LTA 
is in principle five years. If the assessment period is shorter than the prescribed minimum, the deferral period of the variable 
compensation to be granted is extended by the number of years missing for the minimum assessment period. The Short-Term 
Award (STA) has an assessment period of one year. The deferral period for the STA is in principle seven years. 

The Long-Term Award (LTA) is granted in the form of share-based instruments (Restricted Equity Awards (REAs)). The REAs 
vest over a deferral period of 5 years in 4 tranches, beginning with a tranche of 40% in year 2 and three tranches of 20% each 
in year 3, 4, and 5 following the grant of the variable compensation (grant date). Subsequent to the grant date, the REAs of 
each tranche are subject to an additional holding period of one year. Accordingly, the Management Board members cannot 
dispose of the shares underlying the REAs until after 4 years, at the earliest, and in full until after 6 years following the grant 
date. During the deferral and holding periods, the value of the REAs is linked to the performance of the Deutsche Bank share 
and is therefore tied to the long-term performance of the Bank, and thereby strengthens the alignment of the Management 
Board members’ incentives to Deutsche Bank’s performance.  

The Short-Term Award (STA) is generally granted in the form of deferred cash compensation (Restricted Incentive Awards - 
RIAs). The STA is paid out in four tranches of 25% each over a total period of seven years in year 1, 3, 5 and 7 following the 
grant date. However, if the STA accounts for more than 50% of the total variable compensation, the portion exceeding 50% is 
also granted in the form of Restricted Equity Awards (REAs). This ensures that at least 50% of the total variable compensation 
is always granted in a share-based form in accordance with the regulatory requirements. The portion exceeding 50% is subject 
to the same deferral rules as the share-based compensation from the LTA. 

Instead of receiving Restricted Equity Awards (REAs) and Restricted Incentive Awards (RIAs) as described above, holders of 
specific  functions  at  certain  Deutsche  Bank  U.S.  entities  are  required  by  applicable  regulation  to  be  compensated  under 
different plans. Restricted compensation for these persons consists of restricted share awards and restricted cash awards. 
The recipient becomes the beneficial owner of the awards as of the Award Date and the awards are held on the recipient’s 
behalf. These awards are restricted for a period of time (subject to the applicable plan rules and award statements, including 
performance  conditions  and  forfeiture  provisions).  The  restriction  period  is  aligned  to  the  retention  periods  applicable  to 
Deutsche Bank´s usual deferred awards. With regard to the Management Board members, these rules apply to Stefan Simon 
due to his role as CEO of Deutsche Bank USA Corp. 

If  a  member  of  the  Management  Board  is  identified  as  ´Senior  Management  Function  (SMF)´  holder  by  the  Prudential 
Regulation Authority (PRA) in the UK, specific deferral provisions under UK regulation, in principle, apply. Fabrizio Campelli 
was identified as SMF holder for 2023 variable compensation purposes due to his oversight responsibility for the UK region. 
In 2023, it was agreed with the PRA that the proportion of the variable compensation which corresponds to the time spent for 
this regional oversight responsibility is subject to the deferral provisions under UK regulation. Therefore, 10% of his variable 
compensation is deferred in line with the UK regulation, i.e. 4% is granted in Restricted Incentive Awards (RIAs) and paid out 
in two equal tranches in year 1 and 3 following the grant date and 6% is granted in Restricted Equity Awards (REAs) and vests 
in 5 equal tranches in year 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 following the grant date. After the vesting, each tranche is subject to an additional 
holding period of one year.

Application of the compensation system in the financial year 

For the Restricted Incentive Awards (RIAs) and Restricted Equity Awards (REAs), specific forfeiture conditions apply during 
the deferral and holding periods (additional information is provided in the section “Backtesting, malus and clawback"). 

Backtesting, malus and clawback 

By granting compensation components in a deferred form spread out over several years, a long-term incentive is created. In 
addition, the individual tranches are subject to specific forfeiture conditions until they vest.  

The Supervisory Board regularly reviews whether the results achieved by the Management Board members in the past are 
sustainable (backtesting). If the outcome is that the achievements underlying the granting of the variable compensation were 
not sustainable, the awards may be partially or fully forfeited.  

Also, if the Group’s results are negative, previously granted variable compensation may be declared fully or partially forfeited 
during the deferral period. In addition, the awards may be fully or partially forfeited if specific solvency or liquidity conditions 
are not met. Furthermore, awards may be forfeited in whole or in part in the event of individual misconduct (including breaches 
of regulations), dismissal for cause or negative individual contributions to performance (malus). 

In addition, the contracts of the Management Board members also enable the Supervisory Board to reclaim already paid or 
delivered compensation components due to certain individual negative performance contributions by the Management Board 
member (clawback) in accordance with the provisions pursuant to Sections 18 (5) and 20 (6) of the Remuneration Ordinance 
for Institutions (InstitutsVergV). The clawback is possible for the entire variable compensation for a financial year until the end 
of two years after the end of the deferral period of the last tranche of the compensation elements awarded on a deferred basis 
for the respective financial year. 

The Supervisory Board regularly reviews in due time before the respective due dates the possibility of a full or partial forfeiture 
(malus) or reclaiming  (clawback) of  the  Management  Board  members’  variable  compensation  components.  There  was  no 
forfeiture or clawback of awards in 2023. 

The Supervisory Board saw Christiana Riley’s departure from the bank early to take up a job at a financial institution that is in 
competition with Deutsche Bank as grounds for the forfeiture of deferred and non-vested variable compensation components 
(awards) in accordance with the applicable plan rules and award statements. Christiana Riley agreed to this.

Information on shares and fulfilling the share ownership obligation (Shareholding 
Guidelines) 

All members of the Management Board are required to acquire a significant amount of Deutsche Bank shares and to hold 
them  on  a  long-term  basis.  This  requirement  is  meant  to  foster  the  alignment  of  the  Management  Board  members  with 
Deutsche Bank and its shareholders and to ensure a long-term link to the development of Deutsche Bank’s business. 

For the Chief Executive Officer, the number of shares to be held is equivalent to 200% of his annual gross base salary, and 
for the other Management Board members, 100% of their annual gross base salary. The requirements of the shareholding 
obligation must first be fulfilled as of the date on which the share-based variable compensation that has been granted to the 
Management Board member since his or her appointment to the Management Board (waiting period) in total corresponds to 
1.33 times the shareholding obligation. Compliance with the requirements is reviewed semi-annually. If the required number 
of shares is not met, the Management Board members must correct any deficiencies by the next review. 

In the context of granting variable compensation, the Supervisory Board can resolve on an individual basis that not only the 
Long-Term Award (LTA) but also parts of the Short-Term Award (STA) or the STA as a whole may be awarded in shares until 
the shareholding obligation is fulfilled. This is intended to ensure faster compliance with the shareholding obligation.

Annual Report 2023 

Compensation of the Management Board 
Application of the compensation system in the financial year 

The  Chairman  of  the  Management  Board,  Mr. Sewing,  voluntarily  committed  to  invest  15%  of  his  monthly  net  salary  in 
Deutsche Bank shares from September 2019 until the end of December 2023. In each case, purchases take place on the 
22nd day of each month or on the following trading day. 

Benefits as of the end of the mandate 

Benefits upon regular contract termination 

The  Supervisory  Board  allocates  an  entitlement  to  pension  plan  benefits  to  the  Management  Board  members.  These 
entitlements involve a pension plan with predefined contributions. Under this pension plan, a personal pension account is set 
up  for  each  participating  member  of  the  Management  Board  with  effect  from  the  start  of  office  as  a  Management  Board 
member. 

The  members  of  the  Management  Board,  including  the  Management  Board  Chairman,  receive  a  uniform,  contractually 
defined,  fixed  annual  contribution  amount  of  € 650,000.  The  contribution  accrues  interest  that  is  credited  in  advance  and 
determined by means of an age-related factor, up to the age of 60. For entitlements from a first-time or renewed appointment 
starting from the 2021 financial year, interest accrues at an average rate of 2% per annum, for legacy entitlements 4%. From 
the age of 61 onwards, an additional contribution equal to the amount resulting from applying the above interest rate to the 
balance of the pension account as of December 31 of the previous year will be credited to the pension account. The annual 
contributions, taken together, form the pension capital amount available to pay the future pension benefits upon the occurrence 
of a pension event (retirement age, disability or death). The pension account balance is vested from the start.  

If a Management Board member is subject to non-German income tax, the granting of an annual pension cash allowance of 
€ 650,000 may be selected as an alternative to the pension plan entitlement. This is subject to the precondition that receiving 
the  customary  pension  plan  contributions  entails  not  insignificant  tax-related  disadvantages  for  the  Management  Board 
member compared to receiving a pension allowance. This option can be exercised once and from then on applies to the entire 
term of office of the Management Board member.  

The following table shows the annual contributions, the interest credits, the account balances and the annual service costs for 
the years 2023 and 2022 as well as the corresponding defined benefit obligations for each member of the Management Board 
in office in 2023 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31,2023. The different balances are attributable to the different 
lengths of service on the Management Board, the respective age-related factors, and the different contribution rates.

Benefits upon early termination 

The Management Board members are in principle entitled to receive a severance payment upon an early termination of their 
appointment, provided the Bank is not entitled to revoke the appointment or give notice under the contractual agreement for 
cause. In accordance with the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code, the severance payment amounts 
to up to a maximum of two times the annual compensation at the maximum and must not exceed the amount that would be 
payable as compensation for the remaining term of the service contract. The calculation of the severance payment is based 
on the annual compensation for the previous financial year and, if applicable, on the expected annual compensation for the 
current financial year. The severance payment is determined and granted in accordance with the statutory and regulatory 
requirements, in particular with the provisions of the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (InstitusVerV). 

In the event of a change of control, Management Board members have a special right to termination of their service contract. 
However, in such case, there is no entitlement to a severance payment.

Compensation of the Management Board 
Application of the compensation system in the financial year 

Other service contract provisions 

Term of the service contract  

The term of the Management Board service contracts is linked to the duration of the appointment and is a maximum of five 
years in accordance with Section 84 of the German Stock Corporation Act. The Supervisory Board shall decide at an early 
stage, no later than six months before the expiry of the appointment period, on a renewed appointment. In the case of the 
Management Board member’s reappointment, the service contract is extended for the duration of a renewed appointment. 

For first-time appointments, a contract term of three years is not to be exceeded. The Management Board service contract 
ends automatically with the expiry of the appointment period without requiring the express notice of termination. 

Reduction of base salary in connection with compensation from other mandates 

The service contracts of the Management Board members contain an obligation of the members to ensure that they will not 
receive any compensation to which they would otherwise be entitled in their capacity as a member of any corporate body, in 
particular a supervisory board, advisory board or similar body of any group entity of the Bank pursuant to Section 18 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act. Accordingly, Management Board members do not receive any compensation for mandates 
on boards of Deutsche Bank subsidiaries. 

A Management Board member’s base salary will be reduced in an amount equal to 50% of the compensation from a mandate 
– in particular supervisory board or advisory board mandates – at a company that does not belong to Deutsche Bank Group. 
There is no such deduction of any compensation that does not exceed € 100,000 per mandate and calendar year. 

In  the  2023  financial  year,  the  base  salary  of  one  member  of  the  Management  Board  was  reduced  by  the  amount  of  the 
compensation  from  one  mandate  at  a  company  that  does  not  belong  to  Deutsche  Bank  Group,  since  the  compensation 
exceeded the threshold amount.  

Post-contractual non-compete clause 

After leaving the Management Board, the members are as a general rule subject to a one-year non-compete clause. During 
the  non-compete  period,  Deutsche  Bank  pays  the  Management  Board  member  compensation  (waiting  allowance 
“Karenzentschädigung”) amounting to 65% of his or her annual base salary. The waiting allowance will be credited against 
any claim to severance pay. In addition, the waiting allowance will be reduced by any income that the Management Board 
member earns during the non-compete period from self-employed, salaried or other paid activities that are not subject to the 
non-compete clause. Deutsche Bank may waive a Management Board member’s compliance with the post-contractual non-
compete  clause.  From the  date of  the  waiver,  if  and  when  such  waiver is  granted, Deutsche Bank’s  obligation  to  pay  the 
waiting allowance (“Karenzentschädigung”) ends. 

Christiana Riley left the Management Board with effect from the end of May 17, 2023. Her service contract was terminated by 
way of mutual agreement with effect from the end of May 31, 2023. As provided for in her service contract, a waiting allowance 
(“Karenzentschädigung”)  was  agreed  in  accordance  with  the  post-contractual  non-competition  clause  in  the  amount  of 
€ 130,000 per month, corresponding to 65% of her fixed base salary. The post-contractual non-compete provision applies 
from June 1, 2023, to September 30, 2023, in the scope set forth in the service contract.  

Karl von Rohr left the Management Board with effect from the end of October 31, 2023. The Service Contract ended with the 
end  of  his  appointment  period.  As  provided  for  in  his  service  contract,  a  waiting  allowance  (“Karenzentschädigung”)  was 
agreed in accordance with the post-contractual non-compete clause in the amount of € 162,500 per month, corresponding to 
65% of his fixed base salary. The post-contractual non-compete provision applies from November 1, 2023, to October 31, 
2024, in the scope set forth in the service contract.

There were no deviations from the compensation system in the 2023 financial year.

Compensation of the Management Board 
Outlook for the 2024 financial year 

Outlook for the 2024 financial year 

The current Management Board compensation system was approved by the General Meeting in 2021. Since then, it has been 
proven that the system works well and sets the right incentives. At the same time, the compensation system is competitive. 
Nevertheless, the Supervisory Board and, in preparation, the Compensation Control Committee of Deutsche Bank regularly 
review the compensation system of the Management Board members with regard to market trends and investor feedback. 
Furthermore, the regulatory requirements of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions 
(InstitutsVergV) as well as the principles and recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), as most 
recently amended, are taken into account. 

As part of the review process in 2023, points of improvement were identified, which are explained below. These improvements 
are reflected in a new compensation system that will be submitted for approval to the General Meeting in May 2024 with effect 
from the beginning of 2024 onwards. 

Forward-looking assessment period for the Long-Term Incentive (LTI)  

In the previous compensation system, the collective objectives of the Long-Term Incentive were assessed over a period of 
three years. Thereby, the current financial year was weighted at 60%. The two previous years were weighted at 30% and 
10%, respectively. To reflect the feedback of shareholders, a forward-looking assessment period will be used instead for the 
performance measurement of the future LTI. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous compensation system which stipulated 
different weightings for each financial year, the target achievement will be determined after three financial years. As a result, 
the Supervisory Board will set objectives and their target values for three years in the future. This fosters a long-term focus 
and thus the sustainable development of the Company. 

Reduction of complexity  

The Supervisory Board has identified two changes to significantly reduce the overall complexity of the compensation system 
and thus increase transparency in the Compensation Report: 

–  The  complexity of  variable  compensation  has  been  simplified  by  reducing  the  number of  objectives.  In  the  Short-Term 
Incentive  (STI),  a  maximum  of  five  objectives  for  measuring  individual  and  divisional  performance  will  be  set  in  future 
instead of the previous three to four individual objectives, plus an additional behavior objective and a complex balanced 
scorecard with a large number of Key Performance Indicators. The future STI objectives can be categorized into "Financial", 
"ESG" and "Personal", always ensuring a balance of financial and non-financial, quantitative, and qualitative objectives. 
The LTI provides for a lower number of objectives compared to the previous system. The objectives of the LTI are reflected 
by  Group  financials  (Return  on  Tangible  Equity  (RoTE)  and  Total  Book  Value  per  Share  (TBVPS)),  Relative  Total 
Shareholder Return (RTSR) and ESG objectives.  

–  Total  variable  compensation  will  continue  to  be  granted  predominantly  in  deferred  form  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of 
earnings within the framework of the business and risk strategies. Furthermore, total variable compensation will continue 
to be granted predominantly as equity-based instruments to achieve an even stronger alignment of the Management Board 
members’  compensation  to  the  Bank’s  performance  and  its  share  price.  In  the  previous  compensation  system,  the 
underlying scheme for deferral and holding periods was perceived as complex. In the future, half of the STI will be paid out 
directly after the one-year assessment period in cash and the other half is granted equity-based with an additional holding 
period  of  one  year.  The  LTI  will  be  paid  out  in  equity,  starting  one  year  after  the  three-year  assessment  period,  and 
distributed over five equal, consecutive installments, each with an additional holding period of one year. In total, the full LTI 
pay out amount of a tranche will be available for disposal after nine years. The Supervisory Board is confident that the new 
scheme for deferral and holding periods is significantly simpler and more comprehensible, while at the same time fulfilling 
the regulatory requirements of the InstitutsVergV.

Annual Report 2023 

Compensation of the Management Board 
Outlook for the 2024 financial year 

Increase of pay-for-performance alignment  

Several  shareholders  expressed  concerns  regarding  the  design  of  the  previous  target  achievement  curve for the  Relative 
Total  Shareholder  Return  (RTSR)  in  the  long-term  component,  which  measures  the  TSR  of  the  Deutsche  Bank  share  in 
relation to the average TSR of a selected peer group. In particular, shareholders criticized that payout starts at a TSR of 40% 
below the peer group and an equal performance with the peer group results in a target achievement of 100%. In line with the 
market  practices  of  international  banks  and  to  further  strengthen  the  pay-for-performance  alignment  of  Deutsche  Bank´s 
compensation, the target achievement for the RTSR will be assessed based on Deutsche Bank´s percentile rank compared 
to the individual companies in the peer group. According to the new method, the payout starts if the percentile rank of Deutsche 
Bank is at the median, i.e., Deutsche Bank must outperform 50% of the companies in the peer group. A target achievement 
of 100% is defined as reaching the 70th percentile, which, in the current peer group of ten international banks, corresponds 
to achieving rank 4 in terms of TSR performance. Only ranks 1 and 2 allow a payout at the upper threshold of 150% target 
achievement. The Supervisory Board would like to point out that the ambition level of the new target achievement curve goes 
beyond the current practice in the German market and shows that shareholders` feedback has been heard and implemented. 

Increase in market alignment  

To  increase  market  alignment  and  harmonize  further  contractual  agreements  of  the  Management  Board  compensation, 
changes have been made in the pension scheme, shareholding guidelines and termination benefits.  

–  With regard to the former pension scheme, a simple cash allowance model will be introduced for newly appointed members 
of the Management Board. The cash allowance is paid out directly in a lump sum. This avoids interest rate and biometric 
risks in financing a pension entitlement as well as the administrative procedures associated with this for the Deutsche Bank. 
In addition, the annual pension allowance for a newly ordinary Management Board member will be 30% lower than the 
pension contribution currently granted. 

–  Furthermore, in line with current market practice, a build-up phase of four years will be introduced for the obligation under 

shareholding guidelines.  

–  In  line  with  German  market  practice  as  well  as  recommendation  G.13  German  Corporate  Governance  Code  (GCGC), 
severance payments are currently limited to two times the annual total compensation and are not paid beyond the remaining 
term of the service contract (severance cap). Considering feedback from investors and other stakeholders, the Supervisory 
Board  will  reduce  the  severance  cap  at  a  maximum  of  two  years'  base  salary  for  newly  appointed  members  of  the 
Management  Board.  In  addition,  the  waiting  allowance  (Karenzentschädigung)  for  the  duration  of  the  subsequent  non-
competition period will be lowered from 65% of the annual base salary to 50% of the annual base salary.  

Outlook on the objectives of the variable compensation 2024-2026 

The new compensation system establishes a strong alignment of interests between the Management Board members and 
shareholders of Deutsche Bank and allows for a high degree of transparency for stakeholders. Against this background, the 
Supervisory Board made a commitment to disclose the long-term objectives and target values of the variable compensation 
2024, which is based on the new compensation system, before the start of  the respective assessment period. Short term 
individual targets will continue to be disclosed retrospectively.

Compensation of members of the Supervisory Board 

Supervisory Board compensation, which can be amended by the General Meeting if necessary, is regulated in Section 14 of 
the Articles of Association. New compensation provisions were last adopted by resolution of the General Meeting on May 17, 
2023. Accordingly, the following provisions apply as of May 17, 2023: 

The  members  of  the  Supervisory  Board  receive  a  fixed  annual  compensation  (“Supervisory  Board  Compensation”).  The 
amount  of  the  annual  base  compensation  for  each  Supervisory  Board  member  is  € 300,000,  for  the  Supervisory  Board 
Chairman € 950,000, and for each Deputy Chairperson € 475,000. 

Chairs of the committees of the Supervisory Board are paid additional fixed annual compensation amounts as follows: 

Committee chair

Audit Committee 
Risk Committee

If a Supervisory Board member is chair of more than one committee, compensation is only paid for the committee entitled to 
the highest amount. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board does not receive any additional compensation for chairing of the 
committees. Members of the committees also do not receive additional compensation. 

In  connection  with  the  new  regulation  of  Supervisory  Board  Compensation,  the  General  Meeting  resolved  to  approve  the 
following transitional regulations with effect from May 17, 2023:  

If  the  amount  of  the  Supervisory  Board  Compensation  does  not  exceed  the  Supervisory  Board  Compensation 
previously paid in the individual case (calculated compensation for the 2023 financial year based on the previous 
regulation in the Articles of Association), a member of the Supervisory Board whose current term of office began 
before  May  17,  2023,  will  receive  a  compensating  payment  in  the  form  of  a  cash  payment  in  the  amount  of  the 
difference  between  the  previously  granted  Supervisory  Board  Compensation  and  the  Supervisory  Board 
Compensation pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section 14 of the Articles of Association. In the event of  a re-
election as member of the Supervisory Board, the provisions of the Articles of Association in the version adopted on 
May 17, 2023, apply.  

Members of the Supervisory Board whose current term of office began before May 17, 2023, will receive the virtual 
shares cumulatively earned during the current term of office paid out in February 2024 on the basis of the average 
closing price during the last 10 trading days of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra or successor system) of the 
preceding January. 

The compensation determined will be paid to the respective member of the Supervisory Board by, at the latest, two months 
after submitting invoices and as a rule within the first three months of the following year.  

In case of a change in Supervisory Board membership during the year, compensation for the financial year will be paid on a 
pro rata basis, rounded up/down to full months. 

The company reimburses the Supervisory Board members for the cash expenses they incur in the performance of their office, 
including any value added tax (VAT) on their compensation and reimbursements of expenses. Furthermore, any employer 
contributions to social security schemes that may be applicable under foreign law to the performance of their Supervisory 
Board  work  shall  be  paid  for  each  Supervisory  Board  member  affected.  Finally,  the  Supervisory  Board  Chairman  will  be 
reimbursed appropriately for travel expenses incurred in performing representative tasks due to his function and reimbursed 
for costs for the security measures required based on his function. 

In the interest of the company, the members of the Supervisory Board will be included in an appropriate amount in any financial 
liability insurance policy held by the company. The premiums for this are paid by the company. A deductible does not have to 
be specified for the members of the Supervisory Board.

Compensation of members of the Supervisory Board 
Outlook for the 2024 financial year 

Until the new provisions became effective as of May 17, 2023, the following provisions applied for the compensation of the 
Supervisory Board: 

The  members  of  the  Supervisory  Board  received  a  fixed  annual  compensation  (“Supervisory  Board  Compensation”).  The 
annual base compensation amounted to € 100,000 for each Supervisory Board member. The Supervisory Board Chairman 
received twice that amount and the Deputy Chairpersons one and a half times that amount. 

Members and chairs of the committees of the Supervisory Board were paid additional fixed annual compensation as follows:

75% of the compensation determined was disbursed to each Supervisory Board member after submitting invoices within the 
first three months of the following year. The other 25% was converted by the company at the same time into company shares 
based on the average closing price on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra or successor system) during the last ten trading 
days of the preceding January, calculated to three digits after the decimal point. The share value of this number of shares was 
paid to the respective Supervisory Board member in February of the year following his departure from the Supervisory Board 
or the expiration of his term of office, based on the average closing price on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra or successor 
system) during the last ten trading days of the preceding January, provided that the member did not leave the Supervisory 
Board due to important cause which would have justified dismissal (forfeiture regulation). 

In case of a change in Supervisory Board membership during the year, compensation for the financial year was paid on a pro 
rata basis, rounded up/down to full months. For the year of departure, the entire compensation was paid in cash; a forfeiture 
regulation applied to 25% of the compensation for that financial year. 

The company reimbursed the Supervisory Board members for the cash expenses incurred in the performance of their office, 
including any value added tax (VAT) on their compensation and reimbursements of expenses. Furthermore, any employer 
contributions to social security schemes that may be applicable under foreign law to the performance of their Supervisory 
Board work was paid for each Supervisory Board member affected. Finally, the Supervisory Board Chairman was reimbursed 
appropriately for travel expenses incurred in performing representative tasks due to his function and reimbursed for costs for 
the security measures required based on his function. 

In the interest of the company, the members of the Supervisory Board were included in an appropriate amount in a financial 
liability insurance policy held by the company. The premiums for this were paid by the company.

All  employee  representatives  on  the  Supervisory  Board,  with  the  exception  of  Jan  Duscheck,  Birgit  Laumen,  Stephan 
Szukalski and Frank Werneke, are or were employed by Deutsche Bank Group. In the 2023 financial year, we paid such 
members  a  total  amount  of  € 1.32 million  (in  the  form  of  salary,  retirement  and  pension  payments)  in  addition  to  their 
Supervisory Board compensation. 

We do not provide members of the Supervisory Board with any benefits after they have left the Supervisory Board, although 
members who are or were employed by us are entitled to the benefits associated with the end of such employment (i.e., not 
on  the  basis  of  their  Supervisory  Board  work).  During  2023,  we  set  aside  € 0.10 million  for  pension,  retirement  or  similar 
benefits for the members of the Supervisory Board who are or were employed by us.

Annual Report 2023 

Comparative presentation of compensation and earnings trends 
Supervisory Board Compensation for the 2023 and 2022 financial years 

Comparative presentation of compensation and 
earnings trends  

The following table shows the comparative presentation of the change from year to year in the compensation, in the earnings 
of  the  company  and  the  Group  as  well  as  the  average  compensation  of  employees  on  a  full-time  equivalent  basis.  The 
information provided pursuant to Section 162 (1) sentence 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act will be successively 
expanded with the change from one financial year to the prior year until a reporting period of five years is reached. Starting 
with the 2025 financial year, the year-to-year changes will be shown for each of the past five years.  

The information on the compensation of the current and former members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board 
reflects the individualized statement in the Compensation Report of the paid or owed compensation pursuant to Section 162 
(1) sentence 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act. The presentation of the development of the company’s earnings 
is to reflect, according to the legal requirements, those of the stand-alone listed company, i.e. Deutsche Bank AG. Accordingly, 
the net income (net loss) of Deutsche Bank AG is used to present earnings within the meaning of Section 162 (1) sentence 2 
No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act. As the Management Board compensation is measured on the basis of Group 
figures, the earnings figures for the Group are additionally shown for the comparative presentation. These Group earnings 
figures are net income (net loss), cost/income ratio and Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE). For the group of employees for the 
comparison, the data relevant for Deutsche Bank Group were used in light of Deutsche Bank’s global workforce. The group 
of employees for the comparison comprises all of the employees worldwide of Deutsche Bank Group.

Annual Report 2023 

Independent auditor’s report 
Supervisory Board Compensation for the 2023 and 2022 financial years 

Independent auditor’s report 

To Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main 

We  have  audited  the  attached  remuneration  report  of  Deutsche  Bank  Aktiengesellschaft,  Frankfurt  am  Main,  prepared  to 
comply with Sec. 162 AktG [“Aktiengesetz”: German Stock Corporation Act] for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 31 
December 2023 and the related disclosures. We have not audited the content of the disclosures in section “Compensation of 
the employees” where they go beyond the scope of Sec. 162 AktG. 

Responsibilities of the executive directors and the supervisory board 

The executive directors and supervisory board of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the preparation of the 
remuneration  report  and  the  related  disclosures  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  Sec.  162  AktG.  In  addition,  the 
executive directors and supervisory board are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of a remuneration report and the related disclosures that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error. 

Auditor’s responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report and the related disclosures based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated 
by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration 
report and the related disclosures are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts in the remuneration report and the related 
disclosures. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement  of  the  remuneration  report  and  the  related  disclosures,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk 
assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  preparation  of  the  remuneration  report  and  the  related 
disclosures in order to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the executive directors and supervisory board, as well 
as evaluating the overall presentation of the remuneration report and the related disclosures.  

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

Opinion 

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the remuneration report for the fiscal year from 1 January 
2023 to 31 December 2023 and the related disclosures comply, in all material respects, with the financial reporting provisions 
of Sec. 162 AktG. We do not express an opinion on the content of the abovementioned disclosures of the remuneration report 
that go beyond the scope of Sec. 162 AktG. 

Other matter – formal audit of the remuneration report 

The  audit  of  the  content  of  the  remuneration  report  described  in  this  auditor’s  report  comprises  the  formal  audit  of  the 
remuneration report required by Sec. 162 (3) AktG and the issue of a report on this audit. As we are issuing an unqualified 
opinion on the audit of the content of the remuneration report, this also includes the opinion that the disclosures pursuant to 
Sec. 162 (1) and (2) AktG are made in the remuneration report in all material respects.

Compensation of the employees (unaudited) 
Regulatory environment 

Compensation of the employees (unaudited) 

The content of the 2023 Employee Compensation Report is based on the qualitative and quantitative remuneration disclosure 
requirements outlined in Article 450 No. 1 (a) to (j) Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) in conjunction with Section 16 of 
the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverordnung – InstVV). 

This  Compensation  Report  takes  a  group-wide  view  and  covers  all  consolidated  entities  of  the  Deutsche  Bank  Group.  In 
accordance with regulatory requirements, equivalent reports for 2023 are prepared for the following Significant Institutions 
within Deutsche Bank Group: BHW Bausparkasse AG, Germany; Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., Luxembourg; Deutsche 
Bank S.p.A., Italy; Deutsche Bank Mutui S.p.A., Italy; Deutsche Bank S.A.E., Spain. 

Regulatory environment  

Ensuring  compliance  with  regulatory  requirements  is  an  overarching  consideration  in  the  bank’s  Group  Compensation 
Strategy. The bank strives to be at the forefront of implementing regulatory requirements with respect to compensation and 
will  continue  to  maintain  a  close  exchange  with  its  prudential  supervisor,  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB),  to  be  in 
compliance with all existing and new requirements. 

As an EU-headquartered institution, Deutsche Bank is subject to the Capital Requirements Regulation/Directive (CRR/CRD) 
globally, as transposed into German national law in the German Banking Act and InstVV. These rules are applied to all of 
Deutsche  Bank  subsidiaries  and  branches  world-wide  to  the  extent  required  in  accordance  with  Section 27  InstVV.  As  a 
Significant Institution within the meaning of InstVV, Deutsche Bank identifies all employees whose work is deemed to have a 
material  impact  on  the  overall  risk  profile  (Material  Risk  Takers  or  MRTs)  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  stipulated  in  the 
German Baking Act and in the Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/923. Deutsche Bank identifies MRTs at a Group level, 
at the level of Significant Institutions and, in accordance with the German Banking Act, for all CRR institutions at a solo level. 

Taking into account more specific sectorial legislation and in accordance with InstVV, some of Deutsche Bank’s subsidiaries 
(in particular within the DWS Group) fall under sector specific remuneration rules, such as the Alternative Investments Fund 
Managers Directive (AIFMD), the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) and 
the Investment Firm Directive (IFD) including the applicable local transpositions. MRTs are also identified in these subsidiaries. 
Identified employees are subject to the remuneration provisions outlined in the applicable Guidelines on sound remuneration 
policies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA). 

Deutsche Bank takes into account the regulations targeted at employees who engage directly or indirectly with the bank’s 
clients, for instance as per the local transpositions of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II – MiFID II. Accordingly, 
specific provisions for employees deemed to be Relevant Persons are implemented with a view to ensuring that they act in 
the best interest of the bank’s clients. 

Where applicable, Deutsche Bank is also subject to specific rules and regulations implemented by local regulators. Many of 
these requirements are aligned with the InstVV. However, where variations are apparent, proactive and open discussions with 
regulators have enabled the bank to follow the local regulations whilst ensuring that any impacted employees or locations 
remain within the bank’s overall Group Compensation Framework. This includes, amongst others, the compensation structures 
applied  to  Covered Employees  in  the  United  States  under  the  requirements  of  the  Federal  Reserve Board  as  well  as  the 
requirements related to compensation recovery for executive officers in the event of an accounting restatement as required 
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In any case, the InstVV requirements are applied as minimum standards 
globally.

Compensation governance 

Compensation governance 

Deutsche  Bank  has  a  robust  governance  structure enabling it  to  operate  within  the  clear parameters of  its  Compensation 
Strategy and Policy. In accordance with the German two-tier board structure, the Supervisory Board governs the compensation 
of the Management Board members while the Management Board oversees compensation matters for all other employees in 
the Group. Both the Supervisory Board and the Management Board are supported by specific committees and functions, in 
particular the Compensation Control Committee (CCC), the Compensation Officer, and the Senior Executive Compensation 
Committee (SECC). 

In  line  with  their  responsibilities,  the  bank’s  control  functions  are  involved  in  the  design  and  application  of  the  bank’s 
remuneration systems, in the identification of MRTs and in determining the total amount of VC. This includes assessing the 
impact of employees’ behavior and the business-related risks, performance criteria, granting of remuneration and severances 
as well as ex-post risk adjustments.

Compensation Control Committee (CCC) 
The Supervisory Board has set up the CCC to support in establishing and monitoring the structure of the compensation system 
for  the  Management  Board  Members  of  Deutsche  Bank AG.  Furthermore,  the  CCC  monitors  the  appropriateness  of  the 
compensation systems for the employees of Deutsche Bank Group, as established by the Management Board and the SECC. 
The CCC reviews whether the total amount of variable compensation is affordable and set in accordance with the risk, capital 
and  liquidity  situation  as  well  as  in  alignment  with  the  business  and  risk  strategies.  Furthermore,  the  CCC  supports  the 
Supervisory Board in monitoring the MRT identification process. 

The  CCC  consists  of  the  Supervisory  Board  Chairperson  as  well  as  two  other  Supervisory  Board  Members  representing 
shareholders and three Supervisory Board Members representing employees. The Committee held seven meetings in the 
calendar  year  2023.  The  members  of  the  Risk  Committee  attended  two  meetings  as  guests,  the  Chairperson  of  the  Risk 
Committee attended four meetings as guest. The Chairperson of the CCC is also a member of the Risk Committee. Further 
details can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board within the Annual Report.

Compensation Officer 
The  Management  Board,  in  cooperation  with  the  CCC,  has  appointed  a  Group  Compensation  Officer  to  support  the 
Supervisory  Boards  of  Deutsche  Bank AG  and  of  the  bank’s  Significant  Institutions  in  Germany  in  performing  their 
compensation related duties. The Compensation Officer is involved in the conceptual review, development, monitoring and 
application  of  the  employees’  compensation  systems,  the  MRT  identification and  remuneration  disclosures on  an  ongoing 
basis. The Compensation Officer performs all relevant monitoring obligations independently, provides an assessment on the 
appropriateness  of  the  design  and  strategy  of  the  compensation  systems  for  employees  at  least  annually  and  regularly 
supports and advises the CCC. 

Senior Executive Compensation Committee (SECC) 
The SECC is a delegated committee established by the Management Board which has the mandate to develop sustainable 
compensation principles, to prepare recommendations on Total Compensation levels and to ensure appropriate compensation 
governance and oversight. The SECC establishes the Compensation and Benefits Strategy, Policy and corresponding guiding 
principles. Moreover, using quantitative and qualitative factors, the SECC assesses Group and divisional performance as a 
basis  for  compensation  decisions  and  makes  recommendations  to  the  Management  Board  regarding  the  total  amount  of 
annual variable compensation and its allocation across business divisions and infrastructure functions. 

In order to maintain its independence, only representatives from infrastructure and control functions who are not aligned to 
any  of  the  business  divisions  are  members  of  the  SECC.  In  2023,  the  SECC’s  membership  comprised  of  the  DB  AG 
Management Board member responsible for Human Resources and the Chief Financial Officer as Co-Chairpersons, the Head 
of Compliance, the Head of Performance & Reward as well as an additional representative from both Finance and Risk as 
voting members. The Compensation Officer, the Deputy Compensation Officer and an additional representative from Finance 
participated as non-voting members. The SECC generally meets on a monthly basis but with more frequent meetings during 
the compensation process. It held 19 meetings in total with regard to the compensation process for the performance year 
2023.

Compensation and Benefits Strategy 

Compensation and Benefits Strategy 

Deutsche Bank recognizes that its compensation framework plays a vital role in supporting its strategic objectives. It enables 
the  bank  to  attract  and  retain  the  individuals  required  to  achieve  the  bank’s  objectives.  The  Compensation  and  Benefits 
Strategy is built on three core pillars that support the bank’s global, client-centric business and risk strategy, reinforced by safe 
and sound compensation practices that operate within the bank’s profitability, solvency, and liquidity position.

Group Compensation Framework 

Group Compensation Framework 

The compensation framework, generally applicable globally across all regions and business lines, emphasizes an appropriate 
balance  between  Fixed  Pay  (FP)  and  Variable  Compensation (VC)  –  together  forming  Total  Compensation  (TC).  It  aligns 
incentives  for  sustainable  performance  at  all  levels  of  Deutsche  Bank  whilst  ensuring  the  transparency  of  compensation 
decisions and their impact on shareholders and employees. The underlying principles of the compensation framework are 
applied to all employees equally, irrespective of differences in seniority, tenure, gender or ethnicity. 

Pursuant to CRD and the requirements subsequently adopted in the German Banking Act,  Deutsche Bank is subject to a 
maximum  ratio  of  1:1  with  regard  to  fixed-to-variable  remuneration  components,  which  was  increased  to  1:2  for  a  limited 
population with shareholder approval on May 22, 2014 with an approval rate of 95.27%, based on valid votes by 27.68% of 
the share capital represented at the Annual General Meeting. Nonetheless, the bank has determined that employees in specific 
infrastructure  functions  (such  as  Legal,  Group  Tax  and  Human  Resources)  should  in  general  continue  to  be  subject  to  a 
maximum ratio of 1:1 while Control Functions as defined by InstVV are subject to a maximum ratio of 2:1. These Control 
Functions comprise Risk, Compliance, Anti-Financial Crime, Group Audit and the Compensation Officer and his Deputy. 

The bank has assigned a Reference Total Compensation (RTC) to eligible employees that describes a reference value for 
their role. This value provides employees with orientation on their FP and VC. Actual individual TC can be at, above or below 
the Reference Total Compensation, depending on VC decisions. 

Fixed  Pay  is  used  to  compensate  employees  for  their  skills,  experience  and  competencies,  commensurate  with  the 
requirements, size and scope of their role. The appropriate level of FP is determined with reference to the prevailing market 
rates for each role, internal comparisons and applicable regulatory requirements. FP plays a key role in order to attract and 
retain the right talent. For the majority of employees, FP is the primary compensation component. 

Variable Compensation reflects affordability and performance at Group, divisional, and individual level. It allows the bank to 
differentiate individual performance and to drive behavior through appropriate incentives that can positively influence culture. 
It also allows for flexibility in the cost base. For most employees globally, VC is granted as Individual VC and considers the 
applicable divisional and the employee’s individual performance, conduct, and adherence to values and beliefs. In addition, it 
is subject to Group affordability and linked to Group performance. Employees who are not eligible for an award of Individual 
VC are granted a Group VC Component and may be nominated for a Recognition Award (where applicable). The Group VC 
Component reflects the bank’s annual achievements in reaching its strategic targets whilst Recognition Awards provide the 
opportunity to acknowledge and reward outstanding contributions made by the employees of lower seniority levels in a timely 
and transparent manner.

Compensation of the employees (unaudited) 
Employee groups with specific compensation structures 

In  the  context  of  InstVV,  severance  payments  are  considered  variable  compensation.  The  bank’s  severance  framework 
ensures full alignment with the respective InstVV requirements. 

Employee benefits complement Total Compensation and are considered FP from a regulatory perspective, as they have no 
direct  link  to  performance  or  discretion.  They  are  granted  in  accordance  with  applicable  local  market  practices  and 
requirements. Pension expenses represent the main element of the bank’s benefits portfolio globally. 

Employee groups with specific compensation structures 

For some areas of the bank, compensation structures apply that deviate, within regulatory boundaries, in some aspects from 
the Group Compensation Framework outlined above. 

Postbank units 
While generally executive staff of former Postbank follow the remuneration structure of Deutsche Bank, the compensation for 
any other staff in Postbank units is based on specific frameworks agreed with trade unions or with the respective workers’ 
councils. Where no collective agreements exist, compensation is subject to individual contracts. In general, non-executive and 
tariff staff in Postbank units receive VC, but the structure and portion of VC can differ between legal entities. 

DWS 
The vast majority of DWS asset management entities and employees fall under AIFMD, UCITS or IFD, while a limited number 
of  employees  remain  in  scope  of  the  bank’s  Group  Compensation  Framework  and  InstVV.  DWS  has  established  its  own 
compensation governance, policy, and structures, as well as Risk Taker identification process in line with AIFMD/UCITS/IFD 
requirements.  These  structures  and  processes  are  aligned  with  InstVV  where  required  but  tailored  towards  the  Asset 
Management  business.  Pursuant  to  the  ESMA/EBA  Guidelines,  DWS’s  compensation  strategy  is  designed  to  ensure  an 
appropriate ratio between fixed and variable compensation. 

Generally, DWS applies remuneration rules that are equivalent to the Deutsche Bank Group approach, but use DWS Group-
related parameters, where possible. Notable deviations from the Group Compensation Framework include the use of share-
based instruments linked to DWS shares and fund-linked instruments. These serve to improve the alignment of employee 
compensation with DWS’ shareholders’ and investors’ interests. 

Tariff staff 
Within  Deutsche  Bank  Group  there  are  17,105  tariff  employees  in  Germany  (based  on  full-time  equivalent  as 
of December 31, 2023). Tariff staff are either subject to a collective agreement (Tarifvertrag für das private Bankgewerbe und 
die  öffentlichen  Banken),  as  negotiated  between  trade  unions  and  employer  associations,  or  subject  to  agreements  as 
negotiated with the respective trade unions directly. The remuneration of tariff staff is included in the quantitative disclosures 
in this Report.

Determination of performance-based variable compensation 

Determination of performance-based variable compensation 

The bank puts a strong focus on its governance related to compensation decision-making processes. A robust set of rule-
based principles for compensation decisions with close links to the performance of both business and individual were applied. 

The total amount of VC for any given performance year is derived from an assessment of the bank’s profitability, solvency, 
and liquidity position, and the determination of VC pools for divisions and infrastructure functions based on their performance 
in support of achieving the bank’s strategic objectives. 

In a first step, Deutsche Bank assesses the bank’s profitability, solvency and liquidity position in  line with its Risk Appetite 
Framework, including a holistic review against the bank’s multi-year strategic plan to determine what the bank “can” award in 
line with regulatory requirements (i.e., Group affordability). During this assessment, the bank also considers other limitations 
such as cost constraints. The proportion of the VC pools that is related to Group performance is determined based on the 
performance of a selected number of Group’s KPIs, such as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) Capital Ratio, Cost/Income Ratio 
(CIR), Post-Tax Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE), ESG – Sustainable Finance Volume, Gender Diversity and Control Risk 
Management Grade. In the next step, the bank assesses divisional risk-adjusted performance, i.e. what the bank “should” 
award in order to provide an appropriate compensation for contributions to the bank’s success. 

When assessing divisional performance, a range of considerations are referenced. Performance is assessed in the context of 
financial and – based on Balanced Scorecards – non-financial targets. The financial targets for front-office divisions are subject 
to appropriate risk-adjustment, in particular by referencing the degree of future potential risks to which Deutsche Bank may 
be  exposed,  and  the  amount  of  capital  required  to  absorb  severe  unexpected  losses  arising  from  these  risks.  For  the 
infrastructure functions, the financial performance assessment is mainly based on the achievement of cost targets. While the 
allocation of VC to infrastructure functions, and in particular to control functions, depends on both Deutsche Bank’s overall 
and their own performance, it is not dependent on the performance of the division(s) that these functions oversee. 

At the level of the individual employee, the Variable Compensation Guiding Principles are established, which detail the factors 
and metrics that have to be taken into account when making Individual VC decisions. Managers must fully appreciate the risk-
taking activities of individuals to ensure that VC allocations are balanced and risk-taking is not inappropriately incentivized. 
The factors and metrics to be considered include, but are not limited to, (i) business delivery (“What”), i.e. quantitative and 
qualitative financial, risk-adjusted and non-financial performance metrics, and (ii) behavior (“How”), i.e. culture, conduct and 
control considerations such as qualitative inputs from control functions or disciplinary sanctions. Generally, performance is 
assessed based on a one-year period. However, for Management Board members of Significant Institutions, the performance 
across three years is taken into account.

Compensation of the employees (unaudited) 
Variable compensation structure 

Variable compensation structure 

The compensation structures are designed to provide a mechanism that promotes and supports long-term performance of 
employees and the bank. Whilst a portion of VC is paid upfront, these structures require that an appropriate portion is deferred 
to ensure alignment to the sustainable performance of the Group. For both parts of VC, Deutsche Bank shares are used as 
instruments and as an effective way to align compensation with Deutsche Bank’s sustainable performance and the interests 
of shareholders. 

The bank continues to go beyond regulatory requirements with the scope as well as the amount of VC that is deferred and the 
minimum  deferral  periods  for  certain  employee  groups.  The  deferral  rate  and  period  are  determined  based  on  the  risk 
categorization  of  the  employee  as  well  as  the  business  unit.  Where  applicable,  the  bank  starts  to  defer  parts  of  variable 
compensation for MRTs where VC is set at or above € 50,000 or where VC exceeds 1/3 of TC. For non-MRTs, deferrals start 
at  higher  levels  of  VC.  MRTs  are  on  average  subject  to  deferral  rates  in  excess  of  the  minimum  40%  (60%  for  Senior 
Management) as required by InstVV. For MRTs in Material Business Units (MBU) the bank applies a deferral rate of at least 
50%. The VC threshold for MRTs requiring at least 60% deferral is set at € 500,000. Moreover, for all employees whose FP 
exceeds the amount of € 500,000, the full amount of the VC is deferred. 

As detailed in the table below, deferral periods range from three to five years, dependent on employee groups.

not enter into any transaction having an economic effect of hedging any variable compensation, for example offsetting the risk 
of price movement with respect to the equity-based award. The Human Resources and Compliance functions, overseen by 
the Compensation Officer, work together to monitor employee trading activity and to ensure that all employees comply with

In line with regulatory requirements relating to ex-post risk adjustment of variable compensation, the bank believes that a long-
term view on conduct and performance of its employees is a key element of deferred VC. As a result, under the Management 
Board’s oversight, all deferred awards are subject to performance conditions and forfeiture provisions as detailed below.

Compensation decisions for 2023 

Compensation decisions for 2023 

Year-end considerations and decisions for 2023 
All  compensation  decisions  are  made  within  the  boundaries  of  regulatory  requirements.  These  requirements  form  the 
overarching  framework  for  determining  compensation  at  Deutsche  Bank.  In  particular,  management  must  ensure  that 
compensation decisions are not detrimental to maintaining the bank’s sound capital base and liquidity reserves. 

Despite  a  persistently  difficult  macroeconomic  environment,  Deutsche  Bank  has  demonstrated  resilience  and  achieved 
sustainable business growth and revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit of € 5.7 billion.  

2023 was a successful year for Deutsche Bank, further proving the strength of its Global Hausbank model: a client centric 
approach coupled with targeted investment decisions, without losing focus on continued cost discipline, capital generation and 
strong controls. The bank reconfirmed a measured and forward-looking approach when deciding on variable compensation 
for 2023. This approach balanced the need to grow sustainably whilst remaining within the boundaries of cost commitments 
as well as remunerating employees fairly and competitively based on performance. This resulted in VC levels for 2023 that 
are  more  conservative  than  the  bank’s  financial  performance  might  have  indicated.  As  in  previous  years,  the  SECC 
continuously monitored and reviewed the implications of potential VC awards, both for the bank’s capital and liquidity base 
and for its ambitious cost targets.  

With due consideration for all these factors, the Management Board determined that the bank is in a position to award variable 
compensation, including a year-end performance-based VC pool, of € 1.996 billion for 2023 (2022: € 2.126 billion). The VC 
for the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG was determined, as always, by the Supervisory Board in a separate process, 
but is included in the tables and charts below.  

As part of the overall 2023 VC awards granted in March 2024, the Group VC Component was awarded to all eligible employees 
in line with the  assessment of  the four defined KPI categories which are outlined in the Group Compensation Framework 
chapter  of  this  Report.  The  Management  Board  determined  a  payout  rate  of  70%  for  the  Group  VC  Component  in  2023, 
compared to 80% in 2022 and 77.5% in 2021.

Material Risk Taker compensation disclosure 

On a global basis, 1,477 employees were identified as MRTs according to InstVV for financial year 2023, compared to 1,426 
employees for 2022. This slight increase is attributable to the increased number of quantitative (remuneration driven) MRTs. 
The  number  of  2023  Group  MRTs  amounts  to  1,246  individuals.  Moreover,  179  individuals  were  identified  by  Significant 
Institutions (thereof 44 Group MRTs and two MRTs identified by Other CRR Institutions) and 112 individuals were identified 
by Other CRR Institutions (thereof 16 Group MRTs and two MRTs identified by Significant Institutions). The remuneration 
elements for all those MRTs on a consolidated basis are detailed in the tables below in accordance with Article 450 CRR. 
Where applicable, the EU REM tables display the prescribed business lines as per Annex XXXIII of Regulation No 575/2013. 

With regard to deferral arrangements and pay-out instruments, 81 MRTs identified by Other CRR Institutions, whose total 
remuneration amounts to  € 16.9 million (thereof € 5.7 million variable remuneration including severance payments) benefit 
from a derogation laid down in Article 94(3) CRD point (a) and 70 MRTs identified by Group or Significant Institutions, whose 
total  remuneration  amounts  to  € 15.8 million  (thereof  € 1.9 million  variable  remuneration  including  severance  payments) 
benefit from a derogation laid down in Article 94(3) CRD point (b).

Deutsche  Bank’s  Management  Board  is  responsible  for  the  management  of  the  company  in  accordance  with  the  law,  its 
Articles of Association and the Terms of Reference for the Management Board with the objective of creating sustainable value 
in the interests of the company. It considers the interests of shareholders, employees and other company-related stakeholders. 
The members of the Management Board are collectively responsible for managing the bank’s business. The Management 
Board, as the Group Management Board, manages Deutsche Bank Group in accordance with uniform guidelines; it exercises 
general control over all Group companies. 

The Management Board decides on all matters prescribed by law and the Articles of Association and ensures compliance with 
the legal requirements and internal guidelines (compliance). It also takes the necessary measures to ensure that adequate 
internal guidelines are developed and implemented. The Management Board's responsibilities include, in particular, the bank’s 
strategic  management  and  direction,  the  allocation  of  resources,  financial  accounting  and  reporting,  control  and  risk

in  section  “Goals  for  the  proportion  of  women  in  management  positions  /  gender  quota“  in  this  Corporate  Governance 
Statement).

benefit of the company. The Management Board reports to the Supervisory Board at a minimum within the scope prescribed 
by law or administrative guidelines, in particular on all issues with relevance for the Group concerning strategy, the intended 
business  policy,  planning,  business  development,  risk  situation,  risk  management,  staff  development,  reputation  and 
compliance.

Supervisory Board 

Supervisory Board  

The Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG appoints and dismisses the members of the Management Board, supervises 
and advises the Management Board and is directly involved in decisions of fundamental importance to the bank. Supervision 
and advice also include in particular, sustainability issues. The Supervisory Board works together closely with the Management 
Board in a cooperative relationship of trust and for the benefit of the company. The internal organization of the Supervisory 
Board and its committees as well as the requirements for its members are subject not only to the regulations of the German 
Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz (KWG)) and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (CGCG), but 
also to specific supervisory requirements Such requirements are founded on, among other things, the German Banking Act 
(KWG), the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverordnung (InstitutsVergV)), the  guidelines of the 
European Banking Authority (EBA) and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the administrative practices 
of the European Central Bank (ECB) as our prudential supervisory authority. In individual cases, the regulatory requirements 
may diverge from the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). 

The  types  of  business  that require the  approval  of  the  Supervisory Board to  be  transacted  are specified  in  the  Articles  of 
Association of Deutsche Bank AG. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board may specify additional transactions that require its 
approval. 

The procedures of the Supervisory Board and the tasks and procedures of the Supervisory Board committees are set out in 
their respective terms of reference, which are published on Deutsche Bank’s website (www.db.com/ir/en/documents.htm) in 
their currently applicable versions. The Supervisory Board meets regularly also without the Management Board. In addition, 
the representatives of the employees and the representatives of the shareholders regularly conduct preliminary discussions 
separately.  The  number  of  meetings  and  their  execution  are  specified  in  the  Report  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  along  with 
details on the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees.  

The Chairman of the Supervisory Board plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the Supervisory Board and has a 
leadership role in this. He can issue internal guidelines and principles concerning the Supervisory Board’s internal organization 
and communications, the coordination of the work within the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board’s interaction with 
the  Management  Board.  The  Chairman  of  the  Supervisory  Board  engages  in  investor  discussions  on  Supervisory  Board-
related topics when necessary and regularly informs the Supervisory Board of the substance of such discussions. These also 
cover Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics. The Chairperson of the Audit Committee furthermore conducts 
regular discussions with the auditor outside the meetings. 

Between meetings, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and, to the extent expedient, the chairpersons of the Supervisory 
Board committees maintain regular contact with the members of the Management Board, especially with the Chairman of the 
Management Board, and deliberate with them, among other things, on issues of Deutsche Bank Group’s strategy, planning, 
the  development  of  its  business,  risk  situation,  risk  management,  risk  controlling,  governance,  compliance,  compensation 
systems, IT, data and digitalization, sustainability as well as material litigation cases. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
and – within their respective functional responsibility – the chairpersons of the Supervisory Board committees are informed 
without delay by the Chairman of  the Management Board or by the respectively responsible Management Board member 
about important events of material significance for the assessment of the situation, development and management of Deutsche 
Bank Group.  

Together  with  the  Management  Board,  the  Supervisory  Board  arranges  for  a  long-term  succession  planning.  Promoting 
diversity on the Management Board is very important to the Supervisory Board, and it is intensively addressing the topic. It is 
actively working on Management Board diversity, e.g., in terms of gender, nationality and age, as well as different backgrounds 
and  mindsets.  The  Nomination  Committee  supports  the  Chairman’s  Committee  and  the  Supervisory  Board  in  identifying 
suitable  candidates  to  fill  a  position  on  the  bank’s  Management  Board.  In  doing  so,  the  Committee  prepares  a  position 
description with a candidate profile and states the expected time commitment. Suitable candidates are identified, in some 
cases in collaboration with external recruiting consultants, and structured interviews are conducted. Besides this succession 
planning with external candidates, the Management Board and Supervisory Board maintain a list of internal candidates. The 
Nomination Committee and Supervisory Board regularly receive reports from the Management Board on internal candidates 
for  succession  planning  and  the  process  from  the  perspective  of  the  Management  Board.  For  the  selection  of  suitable 
candidates, external and internal, the Nomination Committee takes into account the balance and diversity of the knowledge, 
skills and experience of all members of the Management Board. It also seeks to foster diversity on the Management Board, 
for example, with regard to gender, nationality and age.

Deutsche Bank  
Annual Report 2023 

Management Board and Supervisory Board 
Supervisory Board 

Building on the work of the Nomination Committee, the Chairman’s Committee submits a recommendation for the Supervisory 
Board’s resolution. Based on this, the Supervisory Board decides on the appointment of Management Board members. The 
first appointment period is for a maximum of three years. Management Board members can be reappointed for one or several 
terms of office, which may be for a maximum of five years pursuant to the law, whereby at Deutsche Bank such reappointments 
should generally also be for a maximum of three years. Besides proposals for the appointment of members of the Management 
Board,  the  Chairman’s  Committee  also  submits  proposals  for  the  dismissal  of  Management  Board  members,  which  the 
Supervisory Board decides on. 

The Supervisory Board ensures compliance with the legally required minimum gender participation pursuant to Section 76 (3a) 
of  the  Stock  Corporation  Act  (AktG).  The  Management  Board  comprised  ten  members  until  May 17,  2023,  including  two 
women: Christiana Riley and Rebecca Short. Christiana Riley decided to leave the bank, so the Management Board, reduced 
in size to nine members since then, has one female member: Rebecca Short. Internal and external feedback on the smaller 
Management Board has generally been with very positive in recognition of its efficiency. As stated at the General Meeting 
2023, the Supervisory Board is not satisfied, however, with the current ratio of women and intends to raise the percentage of 
women in the future. To increase the number of suitable internal female candidates, the Supervisory Board set a corresponding 
objective  for  the  Management  Board  for  the  current  financial  year  for  appointing  women  to  senior  management  positions 
directly  below  the  Management  Board  and  embedded  this  objective  within  the  long-term  performance  metrics  of  the  new 
compensation system for the Management Board. To reach a 100% achievement level in this category, at least 32,5% females 
need to be represented below the two levels of the Management Board by end 2026. 

Based on proposals of the Compensation Control Committee, the Supervisory Board determines the total compensation of 
the individual members of the Management Board and also regularly reviews and resolves on the compensation system for 
the Management Board.  

The Supervisory Board receives reports from the Management Board within the scope prescribed by law or administrative 
guidelines,  in  particular  on  all  issues  of  relevance  for  the  Group  concerning  strategy,  intended  business  policy,  planning, 
business development, risk situation, risk management, staff development, reputation and compliance. Furthermore, Group 
Audit informs the Audit Committee of any deficiencies identified regularly and – in the case of severe deficiencies – without 
undue delay. In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is informed of any serious findings relating to the members 
of  the  Management  Board.  The  Supervisory  Board  and  Management  Board  adopted  an  Information  Regime,  a  general 
engagement  (interaction)  protocol  and  another  engagement  (interaction)  protocol  specifically  for  regulatory  topics.  These 
regulate not only the reporting to the Supervisory Board, but also, among other things the Supervisory Board’s enquiries and 
requests  for  information  from  employees  of  the  company  as  well  as  the  exchange  of  information  in  connection  with 
preparations for the meetings and between the meetings.  

The  Nomination  Committee  and  Supervisory  Board  addressed  the  assessment  of  the  Supervisory  Board  which  is  to  be 
conducted at least annually as prescribed by law pursuant to Section 25d of the German Banking Act (KWG), and which is 
also  the  self-assessment  of  the  Supervisory Board  pursuant  to  Section D.12  of  the  German  Corporate  Governance Code 
(GCGC). The concrete implementation of and the schedule for the assessment were deliberated on and set out at the meeting 
of the Nomination Committee on October 23, 2023. Services of an external advisor were not mandated in this context. The 
assessment was performed essentially on the basis of extensive questionnaires regarding the work of the Supervisory Board, 
of the Supervisory Board committees and of the Management Board, interviews conducted by members of the Nomination 
Committee with the individual members of the Management Board, and an assessment of the individual members of both the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board. The final discussion and approval of the results of the assessment took place at 
the Supervisory Board meeting in plenum on January 31, 2024, and the results were set out in a written final report. The 
Supervisory Board continues to hold the opinion that the Supervisory Board and Management Board have achieved a high 
standard and that there are no reservations, in particular, regarding the professional qualifications, personal reliability and time 
availability of the members of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board.

Management Board and Supervisory Board 
Supervisory Board 

Objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board, Profile of Requirements, 
diversity concept and status of implementation  

The composition of the Supervisory Board should ensure the effective and qualified control of and advice for the Management 
Board  of  an  internationally  operating,  broadly  positioned  bank.  The  suitability  of  each  individual  member  is  assessed, 
determined  and  continuously  monitored  both  internally  by  the  Nomination  Committee  and  the  Supervisory  Board  and 
externally by the regulatory authorities. This suitability assessment covers the expertise, reliability and time available of each 
individual member (individual suitability). In addition, there is an assessment of the entire Supervisory Board’s knowledge, 
skills  and  experience  that  are  necessary  for  the  performance  of  its  tasks  (collective  suitability).  Passing  the  suitability 
assessment of the European Central Bank (ECB) after the mandate is accepted and the continual suitability of the Supervisory 
Board member during the entire mandate with Deutsche Bank AG are mandatory regulatory prerequisites for the performance 
of the tasks as a member of the Supervisory Board. 

The Supervisory Board confirmed its adopted Profile of Requirements at its meeting on July 27, 2023. The Supervisory Board 
specified general fields of expertise and expanded fields of expertise. 

General fields of expertise:  

Ideally, every member of the Supervisory Board possesses these individual qualifications.  

–  Understanding of commercial business issues  
–  Analytical and strategic mindset  
–  Understanding of the German corporate governance system, and – as a result – an understanding of a Supervisory Board 

member’s responsibilities 

–  Understanding of the business model and the structure of Deutsche Bank AG  
–  Basic understanding of the financial services sector, e. g. (i) knowledge in the areas of banking, financial services, financial 
markets, financial industry, including the bank’s home market as well as Europe and the bank’s key markets outside Europe, 
and (ii) knowledge of the relevant clients for the bank, the market’s expectations and the operational environment. 

The fulfillment of these fields of expertise is reported on in summary in the qualification matrix in the line “General fields of 
expertise”.  

Expanded fields of expertise: 

These  fields  of  expertise  refer  to  the  Supervisory  Board  in  its  entirety  (collective  suitability).  The  Supervisory Board,  as  a 
whole,  must  have  an  understanding  of  the  specified  fields  of  expertise  that  is  appropriate  for  the  size  and  complexity  of 
Deutsche Bank AG. They are derived from the bank’s business model and from specific laws and regulations that apply to the 
bank. The fields of expertise are: 

Accounting, including sustainability reporting: 

–  Accounting (International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and German Commercial Code (HGB)) and auditing of 

annual financial statements  

–  Taxation  

Regulatory framework and legal requirements: 

–  Understanding of the key legal framework conditions in the countries in which the company has its main operations  
–  Understanding of the key relevant legal systems for the bank  
–  Experience in the executive management / supervisory board of large enterprises  
–  Regulatory framework and legal requirements, in particular, knowledge of the legal systems relevant for the bank 
–  Knowledge of the social, political and regulatory expectations in the home market 

Human capital, compensation and corporate culture:  

–  Human resources and staff management 
–  Compensation and compensation systems  
–  Selection procedure for management body members and assessment of their suitability 
–  Corporate culture

Management Board and Supervisory Board 
Supervisory Board 

Risk management: 

–  Risk  management  (investigation,  assessment,  mitigation,  management  and  control  of  financial  and  non-financial  risks, 

capital and liquidity management, shareholdings) 

–  Combating money laundering and prevention of financial crime and the financing of terrorism 

Information technology, data and digitalization: 

–  Digitalization, including digital banking  
–  Data, including data governance  
–  Information technology (IT), IT systems and IT security, including cyber risks  

Strategy, transformation and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues:  

–  Strategic planning of business models and risk strategies as well as their implementation 
–  Climate and other environmental aspects 
–  Knowledge  of  social  and  political  expectations (in  particular in the  home market) and  their impacts on  corporate  social 

responsibility  

–  Company’s purpose 

Organizational structure and control of a financial institution 

–  Governance 
–  Management of a large, international regulated company 
–  Internal organization of the bank  
–  Internal audit 
–  Compliance and internal controls 

In order to adequately reflect the bank’s business model, the Supervisory Board shall demonstrate not only these professional 
qualifications but also qualifications and experience in the various client segments and different sales markets.  

Client segments 

–  Private Banking and Wealth Management  
–  Corporate Banking 
–  Investment Banking 
–  Asset Management 

Regional expertise 

–  Germany 
–  Europe 
–  Americas  
–  Asia-Pacific (APAC)  

The Supervisory Board believes that it complies with the specified concrete objectives regarding its composition and the Profile 
of Requirements – as shown in the following qualifications matrix. The members of the Supervisory Board as a whole possess 
the knowledge, ability and expert experience to properly complete their tasks. 

There  are ten independent shareholder representatives  on  the  Supervisory Board. All  members act  with  independence  of 
mind, i.e., all members of the Supervisory Board engage actively in their duties and are able to make their own sound, objective 
and independent decisions and judgements when performing their functions and responsibilities. In the preceding financial 
year, there were no former members of the Management Board on the Supervisory Board.

* Definition of no overboarding: All Supervisory Board members hold an admissible number of board directorships in various companies in addition to Deutsche Bank AG. 

Overboarding, i.e. holding an inadmissible number of board directorships in different companies, is determined on the basis of the statutory regulation in Section 25d (3) of the 
German Banking Act (KWG). A Supervisory Board member may concurrently be a member of the supervisory body of a maximum of five companies (including Deutsche Bank 
AG). If a Supervisory Board member is also an executive director of a company, this Supervisory Board member may concurrently be a member of the supervisory body of a 
maximum of three companies (including Deutsche Bank AG). The decisive factors for determining if this is the case are the supervisory authority’s regulatory requirements in 
consideration of the local laws. Compliance with this statutory regulation is continually monitored by the regulatory authorities. In the event of directorship overboarding, the 
supervisory authorities may require that Deutsche Bank AG revoke a Supervisory Board member’s appointment and prohibit this Supervisory Board member from performing 
his or her work 

** Definition of independence: A Supervisory Board member is independent when there are no personal or business relations with Deutsche Bank or its Management Board that 

may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest. The Supervisory Board issued guidelines for the consistent assessment of the independence of its 
members back in 2017 and updates them regularly. These guidelines also take into account the regulatory requirements on independence. The bank has no controlling 
shareholder at present

Annual Report 2023 

Management Board and Supervisory Board 
Supervisory Board 

There is a regular maximum age limit of 70. In well-founded, individual cases, a Supervisory Board member may be elected 
or appointed for a period that extends at the latest until the end of the fourth Ordinary General Meeting that takes place after 
he or she has reached the age of 70. This age limit was taken into account in the election proposals to the General Meeting 
and shall also be taken into account for the next Supervisory Board elections or subsequent appointments for Supervisory 
Board positions that become vacant.  

For shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, the length of Supervisory Board membership shall not, as a rule, 
exceed 12 years.  

The Supervisory Board respects diversity when proposing its members for appointment. In light of the international operations 
of Deutsche Bank AG, care should be taken that the Supervisory Board has an appropriate number of members with long-
term international experience. Currently, the professional careers or private lives of six members of the Supervisory Board are 
centered outside Germany. Furthermore, all of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board have many years 
of  international  experience  from  their  current  or  former  activities,  for  example,  as  management  board  members  or  chief 
executive officers or in a comparable executive function of corporations or organizations with international operations. The 
Supervisory Board believes that in these two ways the international activities of the company are sufficiently taken into account. 
The objective is to retain the currently existing international profile.  

Special importance has already been attached to an appropriate consideration of women in the selection process since the 
Supervisory Board elections in 2008. For the election proposals to the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board takes into 
account the recommendations of the Nomination Committee and the legal requirements according to which the Supervisory 
Board shall be composed of at least 30% women and at least 30% men. In reviewing potential candidates for a new election 
or subsequent appointments to Supervisory Board positions that have become vacant, qualified women are included in the 
selection process and appropriately considered in the election proposals. At the end of the financial year, five women and five 
men were members of the Supervisory Board on the employee representatives’ side and three women and seven men on the 
shareholder representatives’ side. The statutory minimum quota of 30% has thus been fulfilled for many years now.  

The  average  age  of  the  Supervisory  Board  members  was  57.25  as  of  December  31,  2023.  The  age  structure  is  diverse, 
ranging from 39 to 68 years of age and spanning three generations, according to the general definition of the term.  

The length of membership on the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG ranged from under one year to around 10 years 
at the end of the financial year. The average length of membership on the Supervisory Board as of December 31, 2023, was 
3.2 years. 

The  diverse  range  of  the  members’  educational  and  professional  backgrounds  includes  banking,  business  administration, 
economics,  auditing,  law,  German  studies,  political  science,  electrical  engineering  and  healthcare.  The  resumes  of  the 
members of the Supervisory Board are published on Deutsche Bank’s website (www.db.com/ir/en/supervisory-board.htm). 

The members of the Supervisory Board do not exercise functions on a management body of, or perform advisory duties at, 
major competitors. Material conflicts of interest involving a member of the Supervisory Board that are not merely temporary 
shall  result in  the  termination of  that member’s  Supervisory  Board mandate.  Members of  the  Supervisory Board may not, 
according to Section 25d of the German Banking Act (KWG), and shall not, according to the recommendations under C.4 and 
C.5 of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), hold more than the allowed number of supervisory board mandates 
or  mandates  in  supervisory  bodies  of  companies  which  have  similar  requirements.  These  requirements  were  met  in  the 
preceding financial year.  

Some members of the Supervisory Board are, or were last year, in high-ranking positions at other companies that Deutsche 
Bank has business relations with. Business transactions with these companies were conducted under the same conditions as 
those between unrelated third parties. In the opinion of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, these transactions 
did not affect the independence of the Supervisory Board members involved.

Auditing and Controlling  

Audit Committee Financial Expert  

The Supervisory Board determined that the following members of the Audit Committee are “Audit Committee Financial Experts 
“, as such term is defined by the implementation rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued pursuant to 
Section 407  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of 2002:  Dr.  Dagmar  Valcárcel,  Dr.  Theodor  Weimer,  Professor  Dr.  Norbert 
Winkeljohann  and  Frank  Witter.  These  Audit  Committee  Financial  Experts  are  “independent”  of  the  bank,  as  defined  in 
Rule 10A-3 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  

Furthermore, the Supervisory Board determined in accordance with Sections 107 (4) and 100 (5) of the Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG) and Section 25d (9) of the German Banking Act (KWG) that Dr. Dagmar Valcárcel, Dr. Theodor Weimer, Professor 
Dr. Norbert  Winkeljohann  and  Frank  Witter  have  expert  knowledge  in  financial  accounting  and  the  auditing  of  financial 
statements. 

Dr. Dagmar Valcárcel has expertise in the areas of accounting and auditing through her many years of experience as Chair 
of  the  Management  Board  of  Andbank  Asset  Management  Luxembourg S.A.  and  Barclays  Vida  y  Pensiones,  S.A.U.  and 
through her current work as member of the Board of Directors of Antin Infrastructure Partners S.A. Dr. Theodor Weimer has 
expertise  in  the  areas  of  accounting  and  auditing  through  his  many  years  of  experience  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  of 
HypoVereinsbank / UniCredit AG and as a former member of the Audit Committee of ERGO Gruppe AG as well as through 
his current work as Chairman of the Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG. Professor Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann has expertise 
in the areas of accounting and auditing through his education and training as an auditor and his many years of experience as 
an auditor at various auditing firms and as Chairman of the Management Board of PwC Europe SE. Frank Witter has expertise 
in the areas of accounting and auditing through his many years of experience as Chief Financial Officer of Volkswagen AG 
and as Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen Financial Services AG.  

Compensation Control Committee Compensation Experts  

Pursuant to Section 25d (12) of the German Banking Act (KWG), at least one member of the Compensation Control Committee 
must have sufficient expertise and professional experience in the field of risk management and risk controlling, in particular, 
with regard to the mechanisms to align compensation systems to the company’s overall risk appetite and strategy and the 
bank’s capital base. Based on the recommendation of the Compensation Control Committee, the Supervisory Board resolved 
to  specify  by  name  Dr.  Dagmar  Valcárcel,  Mr.  Alexander  Wynaendts  and  Professor  Dr.  Norbert  Winkeljohann  as 
Compensation Control Committee Compensation Experts. All of them have expertise and professional experience in the field 
of risk management and risk controlling, in particular with regard to mechanisms to align the compensation systems to the 
company’s overall risk appetite and strategy and its capital base. They therefore fulfill the requirements of Section 25d (12) of 
the German Banking Act (KWG). Dr Valcárcel has comprehensive legal experience with compensation frameworks, including 
reputational  risks,  from  her  time  as,  among  other  things,  Head  of  the  Legal  Department  of  Barclays  PLC  for  Western

Principal accountant fees and services 

Principal accountant fees and services  

In accordance with German law, Deutsche Bank’s principal accountant is appointed at the Annual General Meeting based on 
a recommendation of Deutsche Bank’s Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board prepares such a 
recommendation. Subsequent to the principal accountant’s appointment, the Audit Committee awards the contract and in its 
sole authority approves the terms and scope of the audit and all audit engagement fees as  well as monitors the principal 
accountant’s independence. EY GmbH & Co. KG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft („EY“) was the bank’s principal accountant 
for the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years, respectively. 

The tables set forth below contain the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years by EY in each of the following 
categories: (1) Audit fees, which are fees for professional services for the audit of Deutsche Bank’s annual financial statements 
or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements 
for those fiscal years, (2) Audit-related fees, which are fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to 
the  performance  of  the  audit  or  review  of  the  bank’s  financial  statements  and  are  not  reported  as  Audit  fees,  (3) Tax-
related fees,  which  are  fees  for  professional  services  rendered  for  tax  compliance,  tax  consulting  and  tax  planning,  and 
(4) All other fees, which are fees for products  and services other than Audit fees, Audit-related fees and Tax-related fees. 
These amounts include expenses and exclude Value Added Tax (VAT).

The  Audit  fees  include  fees  for  professional  services  for  the  audit  of  Deutsche  Bank’s  annual  financial  statements  and 
consolidated financial statements and do not include audit fees for DWS and its subsidiaries that are not audited by EY. The 
Audit-related fees include fees for other assurance services required by law or regulations, in particular for financial service 
specific attestation, for quarterly reviews, for spin-off audits and for merger audits, as well as fees for voluntary assurance 
services, like voluntary audits for internal management purposes and the issuance of comfort letters. The bank’s Tax-related 
fees include fees for services relating to the preparation and review of tax returns and related compliance assistance and 
advice, tax consultation and advice relating to Group tax planning strategies and initiatives and assistance with assessing 
compliance with tax regulations.  

Under SEC regulations, the principal accountant fees are required to be presented as follows: audit fees were € 68 million in 
2023 compared to € 61 million in 2022, audit-related fees were € 10 million in 2023 compared to € 6 million in 2022, tax-related 
fees  were  € 0 million  in  2023  compared  to  € 0 million  in  2022,  and  all  other  fees  were  € 0 million  in  2023  compared  to 
€ 1 million in 2022.  

United States law and regulations, and the bank’s own policies, generally require that all engagements of Deutsche Bank’s 
principal accountant be pre-approved by the Audit Committee or pursuant to policies and procedures adopted by it. The bank’s 
Audit Committee has adopted the following policies and procedures for consideration and approval of requests to engage the 
principal  accountant  to  perform  non-audit  services.  Engagement  requests  must  in  the  first  instance  be  submitted  to  the 
Accounting  Engagement  Team.  If  the  request  relates  to  services  that  would  impair  the  independence  of  the  principal 
accountant, the request must be rejected. The bank’s Audit Committee has given its pre-approval for specified assurance, 
financial  advisory  and  tax  services,  provided  the  expected  fees  for  any  such  service  do  not  exceed  € 1 million.  If  the 
engagement request relates to such specified pre-approved services, it may be approved by the Accounting Engagement 
Team and must thereafter be reported to the Audit Committee. If the engagement request relates neither to prohibited non-
audit  services  nor  to  pre-approved  non-audit  services,  it  must  be  forwarded  to  the  Audit  Committee  for  consideration.  In 
addition, to facilitate the consideration of engagement requests between its meetings, the Audit Committee has delegated 
approval authority to several of its members who are “independent” as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and the New York Stock Exchange. Such members are required to report any approvals made by them to the Audit Committee 
at its next meeting. 

Additionally, United States law and regulations permit the pre-approval requirement to be waived with respect to engagements 
for non-audit services aggregating to no more than five percent of the total amount of revenues the bank paid to the principal 
accountant, if such engagements were not recognized by the bank at the time of engagement and were promptly brought to 
the attention of the bank’s Audit Committee or a designated member thereof and approved prior to the completion of the audit. 
In 2022 and 2023, the percentage of the total amount of revenues Deutsche Bank paid to its principal accountant for non-
audit services that was subject to such a waiver was less than 5% for each year.

Compliance with the German Corporate Governance 
Code  

Declaration pursuant to Section 161 German Stock Corporation 
Act (AktG) (Declaration of Conformity 2023) 

In updating the  Declaration of  Conformity issued on October 26, 2022, the  Management Board and Supervisory Board of 
Deutsche Bank AG approved the following Declaration of Conformity on October 25, 2023. 

“The Management Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft state pursuant to Section 161 German 
Stock Corporation Act (AktG):  

1.  The last Declaration of Conformity was issued on October 26, 2022. Since then, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft has 
complied with the recommendations of the “Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code” in 
the version of the Code dated April 28, 2022, published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on June 27, 2022, and 
will continue to will continue with them in the future, with the exception of the following deviation:  

With regard to recommendation G.10 second sentence, according to which long-term variable remuneration components 
shall be accessible to a Management Board member only after a period of four years. 
The compensation system for the Management Board provides that the long-term components of variable compensation 
vest over a deferral period of five years. As this involves share-based compensation elements, these are subject to an 
additional holding period of one year after their vesting. With regard to the structure of the deferral period, the Supervisory 
Board members will in future already be able to dispose over a first part after three years and over the last part of the 
long-term  components  after  six  years.  The  Supervisory  Board  thus  remains  within  the  requirements  for  financial 
institutions set out in the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (Institutionsvergütungsverordnung). We do not consider 
a  further  tightening  of  the  bank-specific  regulatory  requirements  to  be  appropriate.  We  declare  a  deviation  from  the 
recommendation, just like last year, although the Management Board members will not be able to dispose over the first 
part of the long-term component granted for the 2021 financial year until 2025 and for the 2022 financial year until 2026. 

2.  The German Corporate Governance Code limits the applicability of the Code’s recommendations to the credit institutions 
and insurance companies to the extent that the recommendations apply to them only insofar as there are no statutory 
provisions to the contrary. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft last reported on the statutory regulations and the effects for 
the Declaration of Conformity in its Corporate Governance Statement in the Annual Report 2022.

Inapplicable Code recommendations due to the precedence of statutory provisions  

Inapplicable Code recommendations due to the precedence of 
statutory provisions  

Pursuant to the recommendation in Section F.4 of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version of April 28, 2022, 
companies  subject  to  special  legal  regulations  shall  specify  in  the  Corporate  Governance  Statement  which  Code 
recommendations were not applicable due to over-riding legal stipulations. 

For Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, this currently applies to the recommendation in Section D.5 of the German Corporate 
Governance Code in the version of April 28, 2022, which states that the Supervisory Board shall form a Nomination Committee 
which is composed exclusively of shareholder representatives. 

Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, as a supervised credit institution, is subject to the special legal regulations of the German 
Banking Act (KWG). The Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft established a Nomination Committee in 
accordance with Section 25d (11) of the German Banking Act (KWG) whose tasks are to support the Supervisory Board in the 
following tasks:  

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

identifying candidates to fill a position on the Management Board and preparing proposals for the election of members of 
the Supervisory Board;  

drawing up an objective to promote the representation of the under-represented gender on the Supervisory Board as well 
as a strategy for achieving this; 

the regular assessment, to be performed at least once a year, of the structure, size, composition and performance of the 
Management Board and of the Supervisory Board and making recommendations regarding this to the Supervisory Board; 

the regular assessment, to be performed at least once a year, of the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual 
members of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board as well as of the respective body collectively; and 

the review of the Management Board’s principles for selecting and appointing persons to the upper management level 
and the recommendations made to the Management Board in this respect. 

The Nomination Committee to be established in accordance with the German Banking Act (KWG) therefore has numerous 
tasks that go beyond the preparation of the election proposals for the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. 
A general exclusion of a supervisory board’s employee representatives from a membership on a committee is only admissible, 
according to prevailing opinion, if there is a material reason for this. Whereas such a material reason can exist for a committee 
that solely handles the preparation of the proposals to the General Meeting for the election of shareholder representatives, a 
justification  for  the  exclusion  of  employee  representatives  is  lacking  for  a  nomination  committee  with  the  range  of  tasks 
assigned to it by the German Banking Act (KWG). Due to the Nomination Committee’s range of mandatory tasks stipulated 
by  the  German  Banking  Act  (KWG)  and  the  inadmissibility  of  discriminating  against  employee  representatives  in  the 
composition of the committees, the recommendation in Section D.4 of the German Corporate Governance Code is therefore 
not applicable to Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft. Nonetheless, in order to take this recommendation into account, Section 
2 (3) of the Terms of Reference for the Nomination Committee provides that the election proposals to the General Meeting 
are prepared only by the shareholder representatives on the Nomination Committee.

Goals for the proportion of women in management positions/gender quota 

Goals for the proportion of women in management 
positions/gender quota  

As of December 31, 2023 the percentage of women on the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG is 40%. The statutory 
minimum of 30% pursuant to Section 96 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) is thereby exceeded. 

 The current German Act to Supplement and Amed Regulations on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management 
Positions in the Private and Public Sectors (Equal Participation Act II (FüPoG II)) requires that at least one woman and one 
man are to be appointed to a management board with more than three members; however, no additional goals must be set. 
With one woman, Rebecca Short, on the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG, the bank fulfilled the requirement as of 
December 31, 2023. 

Deutsche Bank is firmly convinced that an improved gender balance in leadership roles will meaningfully contribute to its future 
success. 

In accordance with the legal framework conditions and based on the bank’s own strategy on diversity, equity and inclusion, 
the bank is working on making progress on its ambitious goals of the “35 by 25” program that the Management Board set on 
May 4, 2021. By 2025 women should represent a minimum of 35% of Managing Director, Director and Vice President positions 
combined. 

The goals for the representation of women on the two management levels below the Management Board are now for at least 
30% women on the first management level and at least 30% women on the second management level below the Management 
Board. These goals are to be reached by December 31, 2025.  

The  population  of  staff  on  the  first  management  level  below  the  Management  Board  comprises  Managing  Directors  and 
Directors who report directly to the Management Board and managers with comparable responsibilities. The population of 
staff on the second management level comprises Managing Directors and Directors who report to the first management level.

As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  proportion  of  women  was  20.0%  (2022:  17.1%)  on  the  first  management  level  below  the 
Management Board and 27.6% (2022: 29.6%) on the second management level below the Management Board. 

While the bank’s commitment to increase the representation of women in senior management positions is global, the bank’s 
implementation is local. Each region and each business have their own diversity and inclusion needs because cultures and 
current social challenges differ from nation to nation and from business area to business area. However, the Management 
Board remains committed to these goals and focused initiatives are put in place to accelerate change. These initiatives apply 
to all phases of career development, spanning across talent recruitment, development, retention and promotions. 

Within this framework, the bank’s decisions on promotions and appointments are aligned, in particular, to the suitability of the 
candidates for the respective roles, their demonstrated performance and their future potential. In line with the bank’s basic 
diversity concept, the bank also take into account the knowledge and skills required for the proper performance of tasks and 
the necessary experience of the employees for the composition of the two levels below the Management Board.

Diversity concept  

As an integral part of Deutsche Bank’s strategy as a leading European bank with a global reach and a strong home market in 
Germany, diversity is a decisive factor for the bank’s success. Diversity, equity and inclusion help Deutsche Bank in forming 
and strengthening relationships with its clients and partners in the societies where the bank does business. 

Age and gender as well as educational and professional backgrounds have long been accepted as key aspects of the far 
more comprehensive understanding of diversity at Deutsche Bank. 

The bank is convinced that diversity, equity and inclusion stimulate innovation, for example, and helps the bank to take more 
balanced  decisions  and  thus  play  a  decisive  role  for the  success  of  Deutsche Bank.  Diversity  and  inclusion are therefore 
integral components of the bank’s values and beliefs and its Code of Conduct. 

The Supervisory Board and Management Board strive to and should serve as role models for the bank regarding diversity, 
equity and inclusion. In accordance with the bank’s values and beliefs specified above, diversity in the composition of the 
Supervisory Board and the Management Board also facilitates the proper performance of the tasks and duties assigned to 
them by law, Articles of Association and Terms of Reference. 

Based on Deutsche Bank’s understanding of diversity, equity and inclusion, the values and beliefs and the measures described 
in  the  following  for  their  implementation  also  apply  –  to  the  extent  legally  admissible  –  to  the  Supervisory  Board  and  the 
Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG. The Supervisory Board considers diversity in the company, in particular, when 
filling positions on the Management Board and Supervisory Board. 

On July 27, 2023, the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG updated the Suitability Guideline for selecting members of the 
Supervisory Board and Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG, which also continues to comprise diversity principles. This 
Suitability Guideline implements the “Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body 
and key function holders” issued jointly by the European Banking Authority and European Securities and Markets Authority. 

Diversity concept for the Supervisory Board  

The diversity concept for the Supervisory Board and its implementation are described above in the section “Objectives for the 
composition of the Supervisory Board, Profile of Requirements, diversity concept and status of implementation”. 

Diversity concept and succession planning for the Management Board  

Through  the  composition  of  the  Management  Board,  it  is  to  be  ensured  that  its  members  have,  at  all  times,  the  required 
knowledge,  skills  and  experience  necessary to  properly  perform  their tasks.  Accordingly, when  selecting  members  for the 
Management Board, care is to be taken that they collectively have sufficient expertise and diversity within the meaning of the 
objectives specified above. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board and Management Board are to ensure long-term succession 
planning. 

The current German Act to Supplement and Amend Regulations on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management 
Positions in the Private and Public Sectors (Equal Participation Act II (FüPoG II) requires that at least one woman and one 
man be appointed to a management board with more than three members; however, no additional goals must be set. The 
bank  fulfilled  this  requirement  as  of  December  31,  2023,  as  it  has  one  woman  on  the  Management  Board.  In  general,  a 
Management Board member should not be older at the end of his or her appointment period than the regular retirement age 
according to the rules of the statutory pension insurance scheme applicable in Germany for the long-term insured to claim an 
early retirement pension.

Implementation  

In accordance with the law, the Articles of Association and Terms of Reference, the Supervisory Board adopted a candidate 
profile for the members of the Management Board, based on a proposal from the Nomination Committee. This profile takes 
into  account  an  “Expertise  and  Capabilities  Matrix”,  specifying,  among  other  things,  the  required  knowledge,  skills  and 
experience to perform the tasks as Management Board member, in order to successfully develop and implement the bank’s 
strategy in the respective market or the respective division and as a management body collectively. The Management Board 
reviews succession plans for Management Board positions, both individually and as a group. Individual succession plans are 
reviewed and internal succession candidates are discussed in detail based on potential, leadership skills and experience as 
well as fit and proper suitability. As gender diversity is a key focus of Deutsche Bank, the respective succession metrics and 
data analytics support this process. After approval by the Management Board these plans are submitted to the Nomination 
Committee and the Supervisory Board in principle at a meeting for extensive deliberation. 

In identifying candidates to fill a position on the bank’s Management Board, the Supervisory Board’s Nomination Committee 
takes  into  account  the  appropriate  diversity  balance  of  all  Management  Board  members  collectively.  Furthermore,  it  also 
considers the targets set by the Supervisory Board in accordance with statutory requirements for the percentage of women 
on the Management Board.  

The Nomination Committee supports the Supervisory Board with the periodic assessment, to be performed at least once a 
year, of the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual members of the Management Board and of the Management 
Board in its entirety.  

Results achieved in the 2023 financial year  

As of December 31, 2023, the Management Board comprised one woman (11%) and eight men.  

The  age  structure  is  diverse,  ranging  from  48  to  56  years  of  age  as  of  December  31,  2023.  The  length  of  experience  as 
member of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank as of December 31, 2023, ranged from less than one year to around 
eight years.  

In light of the bank’s strategy as a leading European bank with a global reach and a strong home market in Germany, five of 
the nine Management Board members as of December 31, 2023 have a German background. Furthermore, the Management 
Board members come from Italy, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland. However, the ethnic 
diversity of the Management Board does not currently reflect the full diversity of the markets where the bank does business 
or the diversity of Deutsche Bank’s employees.  

The  diverse  range  of  the  Management  Board  members’  educational  and  professional  backgrounds  includes  accounting, 
banking, business administration, economics, engineering finance, literature law and philosophy.  

The bank transparently reports on Management Board diversity in addition to the information presented above in this Corporate 
Governance Report in the section “Management Board and Supervisory Board:  

Management Board” as well as on the bank’s website: www.db.com (Heading: Investor Relations, “Corporate Governance”, 
“Management Board”).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This document and other documents the Group has published or may publish contain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-
GAAP financial measures are measures of the Group’s historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that 
contain adjustments that exclude or include amounts that are included or excluded, as the case may be, from the most directly 
comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS in the Group’s financial statements.  

Return on Equity Ratios 

The Group reports a post-tax return on average shareholders’ equity and a post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ 
equity, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. 

The post-tax returns on average shareholders’ equity and average tangible shareholders' equity are calculated as profit (loss) 
attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders after profit (loss) attributable to additional equity components (AT1 coupon) as a 
percentage of average shareholders’ equity and average tangible shareholders' equity, respectively. 

Profit (loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders after profit (loss) attributable to additional equity components (AT1 
coupon)  for  the  segments  is  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure  and  is  defined  as  profit  (loss)  excluding  post-tax  profit  (loss) 
attributable to noncontrolling interests and after profit (loss) attributable to additional equity components (AT1 coupon), which 
are allocated to segments based on their allocated average tangible shareholders’ equity. For the Group, it reflects the reported 
effective tax rate, which was 14% for the full year 2023, (1)% for 2022 and 26% for 2021. For the segments, the applied tax 
rate was 28% for 2023, 2022 and 2021.  

At  the  Group  level,  tangible  shareholders'  equity  is  shareholders’  equity  as  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet 
excluding  goodwill  and  other intangible  assets.  Tangible  shareholders’  equity  for the  segments  is  calculated  by  deducting 
goodwill and other intangible assets from shareholders’ equity as allocated to the segments. Shareholders’ equity and tangible 
shareholders’ equity are presented on an average basis. 

The Group believes that a presentation of average tangible shareholders’ equity makes comparisons to its competitors easier 
and refers to this measure in the return on equity ratios presented by the Group. However, average tangible shareholders’ 
equity is not a measure provided for in IFRS, and the Group’s ratios based on this measure should not be compared to other 
companies’ ratios without considering differences in the calculations. 

The reconciliation of the aforementioned ratios is set forth in the table below:

Revenues excluding specific items 

Revenues excluding specific items 

Revenues excluding specific items is a performance indicator that is a non-GAAP financial measure most directly comparable 
to the IFRS financial measure net revenues. Revenues excluding specific items is calculated by adjusting net revenues under 
IFRS for specific revenue items which generally fall outside the usual nature or scope of the business and are likely to distort 
an accurate assessment of the divisional operating performance. Excluded items are Debt Valuation Adjustment (DVA) and 
material transactions or events that are either one-off in nature or belong to a portfolio of connected transactions or events 
where the P&L impact is limited to a specific period of time. The Group believes that a presentation of net revenues excluding 
the impact of these items provides a more meaningful depiction of the revenues associated with the business.

Adjusted costs/nonoperating costs 

Adjusted costs/nonoperating costs 

Adjusted costs is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is a non-GAAP financial measure for which the most 
directly comparable IFRS financial measure is noninterest expenses. Adjusted costs is calculated by deducting (i) impairment 
of goodwill and other intangible assets, (ii) net litigation charges and (iii) restructuring and severance (in total referred to as 
nonoperating costs) from noninterest expenses under IFRS. The Group believes that a presentation of noninterest expenses 
excluding  the  impact  of  these  items  provides  a  more  meaningful  depiction  of  the  costs  associated  with  the  operating 
businesses.

Revenues and costs on a currency adjusted basis 

Revenues  and  costs  on  a  currency-adjusted  basis are  calculated  by  translating  prior-period  revenues  or  costs  that  were 
generated or incurred in non-euro currencies into euros at the foreign exchange rates that prevailed during the current year 
period. These adjusted figures, and period-to-period percentage changes based thereon, are intended to provide information 
on the development of underlying business volumes and costs.

Outstanding 

Book  value  per  basic  share  outstanding  and  tangible  book  value  per  basic  share  outstanding  are  non-GAAP  financial 
measures that are used and relied upon by investors and industry analysts as capital adequacy metrics. Book value per basic 
share  outstanding  represents  the  Bank’s  total  shareholders’  equity  divided  by  the  number  of  basic  shares  outstanding  at 
period-end. Tangible book value represents the Bank’s total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets. 
Tangible book value per basic share outstanding is computed by dividing tangible book value by period-end basic shares 
outstanding.

CRR/CRD Regulatory measures 

The Group’s regulatory assets, exposures, risk-weighted assets, capital and ratios are calculated for regulatory purposes and 
are set forth throughout this document under the CRR/CRD as currently applicable. 

For  the  comparatives  as  of  December  31,  2021  certain  figures  are  based  on  the  CRR  definition  of  own  fund  instruments 
(applicable for Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital and Tier 2 capital and figures based thereon, including Tier 1, Total Capital and 
Leverage Ratio) are presented on a “fully loaded” basis. Such fully loaded figures are calculated excluding the transitional 
arrangements for own fund instruments as provided in the currently applicable CRR/CRD. Deutsche Bank had immaterial 
amounts of such instruments outstanding at year end 2022 and 2023. For those comparatives periods the CET 1 and RWA 
figures  include  the  transitional  impacts  from  the  IFRS  9  add-back  also  in  the  fully-loaded  figures  given  it  is  an  immaterial 
difference. Measures calculated pursuant to the Group’s fully loaded methodology are non-GAAP financial measures. 

Deutsche  Bank  believes  that  these  fully  loaded  calculations  provided  useful  information  to  investors  as  they  reflected  the 
bank’s progress against then known future regulatory capital standards. Many of Deutsche Bank’s competitors have been 
describing  calculations  on  a  fully  loaded  basis,  however,  competitors’  assumptions  and  estimates  regarding  fully  loaded 
calculations may have varied such that the bank’s fully loaded measures may not have been comparable with similarly labelled 
measures used by its competitors.

Cautionary statement regarding 
forward-looking statements 

This report contains forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking statements are statements that 

are not historical facts; they include statements 

about our beliefs and expectations and the 

assumptions underlying them. These statements 

are based on plans, estimates and projections as 

they are currently available to the management of 

Deutsche Bank. Forward-looking statements 

therefore speak only as of the date they are 

made, and we undertake no obligation to update 

publicly any of them in light of new information or 

future events.  

By their very nature, forward-looking statements 

involve risks and uncertainties. A number of 

important factors could therefore cause actual 

results to differ materially from those contained in 

any forward-looking statement. Such factors 

include the conditions in the financial markets in 

Germany, in Europe, in the United States and 

elsewhere from which the bank derives a substantial 

portion of its revenues and in which we hold a 

substantial portion of its assets, the development 

of asset prices and market volatility, potential 

defaults of borrowers or trading counterparties, 

the implementation of the Group’s strategic initiatives,  

the reliability of its risk management policies, 

procedures and methods, and other risks  

referenced in its filings with the U.S. Securities  

and Exchange Commission. Such factors are  

described in detail in the bank’s SEC Form 20-F of  

March 14, 2024, under the heading “Risk Factors.”  

Copies of this document are readily available 

upon request or can be downloaded from
